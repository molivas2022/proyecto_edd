f the season,
and to pay it then?-I don't think that system would work very
well.  It would entail a great amount of trouble and I cannot see
how it could be carried out.

15,205. Would there be any trouble, except keeping cash at the
stations and handing it to the fishermen at short intervals?-That
would be one great source of trouble.

15,206. Would there be any other?-The difficulty of introducing
such a system appears to me to be this, that the poor men would
not be able to get on in January and February before the fishing
begins, unless they obtained advances of some kind from the
merchants.  If a system of ready-money payments were introduced,
the fish being paid for only when they were delivered in the month
of June, then the men would have some difficulty in maintaining
themselves in the winter and spring.

15,207. No doubt there might be some hardship or difficulty at
first, but after one or two seasons do you not think the men would
have learned to provide for that part of the season?-There are
certain classes of men that I don't see how such a system could
work with at all.

15,208. Could these men not find a certain provision in more
application to the winter fishing?-There are some localities where
the winter fishing is impracticable.  The boats cannot be hauled up
and down, so that really there are no fish got except in a few days
of exceptionally fine weather.


Lerwick, January 30, 1872, PETER GARRIOCK, examined.

15,209. Are you a merchant in Lerwick?-I am an agent in
Lerwick.

15,210. Do you keep a shop?-No; but I keep fishing materials for
my men, and for general sale.

15,211. Are you engaged in the Faroe fishing?-Yes, only in the
Faroe fishing.  I have three vessels employed in it.

15,212. Where are the men employed in these vessels supplied
with their materials and fishing supplies?-Their fishing materials
are got from me, and I generally appoint them to get their other
materials from Hay & Co., or R. & C. Robertson, or Harrison &
Sons.  There are four or five individuals in Lerwick that I give
them their option to get their materials from.

15,213. Do you guarantee these gentlemen for the advances they
give to your men?-Yes; at least of late I have had to do it.

15,214. Do you settle with the merchants before settling with the
fishermen?-No, not before.  The men get their accounts from
them, and we retain the amount.

15,215. Do you receive a commission upon the advances made by
the merchants?-Occasionally.

15,216. Do you not always do so?-No.  Some of them don't agree
to give it; there is no arrangement about that.

15,217. Do those who give it get a reference?-They do not.  The
men have very often to go to them.

15,218. But you give them the option only to go to certain parties
whom you name?-Yes.  If they begin to deal with one party, they
must deal with the same party during the season, because of the
difficulty of keeping accounts with the various parties in the town.

15,219. You name a certain number of merchants with whom they
must deal?-Yes; and they are generally the most respectable
people in Lerwick, where they can get their supplies most
moderately.  But the men were naming any one themselves with
whom they wished to deal, they would have the same option to
deal with him, only they must deal with the same individual for the
season.

15,220. Would you give a similar guarantee to a merchant whom
the men named themselves?-Yes.

15,221. Do you do that in order that the families of the men may
be
able to live during the fishing season-Yes.

15,222. But it is only in the event of a man requiring these
advances that you give such a guarantee, or require them to go
to such a shop?-They all require it.

15,223. Are none of them able to live upon their own resources?-
Plenty of them; but still they come for their supplies.  There was
an instance of that occurred with me only eight days past on
Saturday.  A man who had been in my employment for two or
three years had been engaged two or three weeks before to go to
the fishing for the rising season, and he came on Saturday and
asked for supplies.  I asked him where he wished them from, and
he said Hay & Co.'s, and I gave him an order to go there.  After
giving it to him, he came and asked me for some cash.  I told him
thought it was rather early to come and ask for cash for the rising
season, and that he could hardly have spent the money he had got
from me at settlement.  After a good deal of pressure, he said that
about the time he had settled with me he had got some money
from his son, and he had added it to the money he had from me,
and had put it into the bank, and he did not like to draw it out
again.  Therefore it is not altogether from necessity that they get
these supplies.

15,224. But they all take them as a matter of course?-Yes.  There
are some men who always get them, and the other men would
think they were not so well treated if they did not get them also.

15,225. Then the necessity of making these advances to the men is
one of the elements which the merchant must take into account in
making his arrangements for the season?-To some extent it must
be.

15,226. Is it not an element in fixing the price which the men are
to
get, that the merchant has to make advances of that description?-
Not so far as the Faroe fishing is concerned.

15,227. In the Faroe trade do the men get exactly the same price
for their fish which the merchant realizes?-Yes, and something
more.

15,228. Why do you give more?-Just because we are obliged to
do it.  This year I am paying more than I can get.  I am bound to
pay the currency, as it is called; and if the currency is higher than I
realize for the fish, I am still bound to pay it.

15,229. Have you not been able to sell up to the current price this
year?-No.  I did not accept the price which was offered to me at
one time, thinking the fish would be higher, but instead of being
higher they fell.  I did not sell until after the men were settled with.

15,230. Are you agent or owner of the fishing smack 'Gondola'?-
Yes.

15,231  What was the amount of earnings of the men employed in
that vessel last season?-The men's earnings in 1871 were about
£19 or £20, on an average, for the season.

15,232. Was that the whole proceeds that were paid from the catch
of the 'Gondola'?-Yes.

15,233. Was that the sum of which the men received payment after
the necessary deductions?-The sum which each man receives
varies according to his position [Page 386] in the vessel.  The
master received £42, 11s. 3d.; the mate received £25, 8s. 10d.; one
man received £21, 6s., and the others ran from that to £19, 13s.
6d., if they were there the whole season, according to the amount
of their score-money.

15,234. What was the amount credited to each sharesman for the
value of his share of the fish?-It varied from £19, 13s. 6d. to
about £21, 6s. for an ordinary sharesman.  The score-money makes
a little difference between one sharesman and another.

15,235. What was the amount of the share apart from the
score-money?-It was £14, 4s. 7d. for the Faroe fishing.  That
was for the period when they were paid by shares; but there was
a part of the season when they were paid by wages, when they
were upon an Iceland voyage.

15,236. What was the number of the crew?-There were fourteen
during the Faroe fishing.  Of these, nine were full sharesmen, and
the others varied from threequarters to half a share.  There were
121/4 shares altogether, and the whole proceeds of the fishing
would be divided by that.

15,237. What was the total take of fish?-20 tons 6 cwt. 3 qrs. 21
lbs.

15,238. Was that a fair average fishing for the season?-No, it was
rather a poor season.  I daresay it was fully an average for last
year; but it was a poor fishing, taking other years into account.  We
would not consider it a paying season.

15,239. Who classes the quality of the fish?-It is generally the
merchant.  We usually send the first-class fish to Spain, and the
other cod go to the home market.

15,240. You charge 52s. 6d. as the cost price for curing.  Is that by
arrangement with the men at the beginning of the season?-No.

15,241. Is it rounded upon an estimate of the actual expense of
curing for the year?-We cannot ascertain every particular with
regard to the expense of curing the fish and bringing them into
market; but I am certain we are charging under the rate which it
actually costs us, including wages, salt, material, and a great many
other things that have to be embraced in it.  We have often to
include coffee and other things supplied to the women at the
beach.

15,242. Are the people employed in your curing establishment
paid
by weekly wages or by fees for the season?-They are not paid in
that way at all.  Here [showing in book] is the account of a man,
Arthur Leask, who employs some women from the mainland.  I
make a contract with him for the curing of the fish.  He generally
gives an order to the women, and I pay them what is contained in
that order.

15,243. Is that the way in which most of your curing business is
managed?-Yes.

15,244. Do you cure at the island of Linga?-Yes.  Here [showing]
is another account with people who have been curing for me for a
number of years.  I entered into the contract first with Laurence
Thomson; he died and left the farm, and then John Thomson took
it, and now Miss Thomson has it.

15,245. Is the work all done in contract with them?-Yes.

15,246. Do they give orders to their employés in the same way
as Leask?-I think they manage it themselves, both there and at
Linga, with the exception of the washing.

15,247. Do you pay them in cash?-Yes.

15,248. Have you any transactions with the people employed by
them?-No.

15,249. Had they an account for goods in any shop?-Not so far as
I am aware.

15,250. In what way are the people paid whom Leask sends to you
with orders?-They are paid in cash altogether.

15,251. Have you a written agreement with your Faroe fishers?-
Yes; I have a separate one for each smack every year.

15,252. Do you stipulate in that agreement what deductions are to
be made?-Yes; at least that is done generally.  The deductions,
including the expenses of curing and bringing the fish to market,
and master's and mate's fees, score-money, and cost of bait, are
made from the gross proceeds, and then the balance is divided into
two-one half going to the men, and the other to the owners.

15,253. Is there not a deduction for commission?-No; that is
generally just an understanding.

15,254. What is that understanding?-That a commission is to
be charged.  In the account I have produced for the 'Gondola'
commission and guarantee are charged at 5 per cent.,

15,255. Do the men at settlement see, or desire to see, the bills of
sale?-They have never done so in any case.

15,256. Do they sometimes complain that they did not see them,
or make any complaints about the price of the fish?-They are
always grumbling; but they never made any direct complaint to
me on the subject.  In order to save a good deal of that trouble, the
North Sea Fishing Co. have produced their accounts, but very
frequently they have begun to settle with their fishermen at the
currency before the accounts were ready.

15,257. Do the company produce their bills of sale to the men?-
They are bound to do it if the men call for them.

15,258. Are you connected with that company?-I am a director of
it.  Mr. Irvine, of Hay & Co., is the agent.

15,259. Do you know whether, in point of fact, the fishermen
generally see the bills of sale of that company?-I cannot tell.
That is a matter which is left in the hands of Mr. Irvine.

15,260. Are the men frequently in debt to you at the
commencement of the fishing season?-No.  There were
some men who left me in debt last year, and they have gone
elsewhere,-I don't know where.  In fact I would rather get clear
of a man who is in debt, and take my chance of getting my debt
from him afterwards, than employ him again, unless he was a very
good man.


Lerwick, January 30, 1872, JAMES COUTTS, examined.

15,261. Are you a provision merchant in Lerwick?-I am.  I have
been in business for eleven years.

15,262. Do you deal in anything else but provisions?-Nothing of
any consequence.  Sometimes I get a little cottons, or small wares
as we call them.

15,263. Do you sometimes purchase soft goods over the
counter?-I used to do it; but I have not done so for the last
twelve or eighteen months.

15,264. Why did you give it up at that time?-There were
several reasons for it.  I did not think it was a nice thing to do;
and sometimes it was more bother than it was all worth.

15,265. You probably found your other business increasing?-It
was not for that reason that I gave it up.  I got more humbug by it
than all the good it was.

15,266. How were you humbugged by it?-I would sometimes
take goods in that had perhaps been stolen, and I lost them
altogether.  It was a kind of broker's business that I did.

15,267. Did you do a good deal of that business at one time?-Not
much.

15,268. But still you were a broker to some extent?-It was not
worth speaking of.

15,269. What kind of goods were you in the habit of getting in that
way?-Various sorts of goods, such as wearing apparel.  There
was nothing else that I recollect of particularly just now.

15,270. Did you sometimes get cottons and other goods that were
not made up into wearing apparel?-Not that I remember.

15,271. I thought you said you had dealt to some extent in cottons
and calicoes?-I got them from the south along with my other
goods.

15,272. Did you sometimes lay in a small stock of these?-Yes.

15,273. Have you never purchased any cotton, or [Page 387]
calicoes, or dress stuffs not made up, from people at your
counter?-I cannot recollect just now.  I had a small book in
which I entered these purchases.

15,274. Have you got that book with you?-I have not seen it for
the last six months.

15,275. You will go for that book, and show it to me here?-Yes.


Lerwick, January 30, 1872, LAURENCE THOMPSON, examined.

15,276. Are you a seaman in Lerwick?-I am.

15,277. Have you gone frequently on sealing and whaling voyages
from this port?-Yes.

15,278. By what agent, have you been engaged?-I have gone
from them all.

15,279. Did you have an account for outfit and supplies from the
agent who engaged you every time you went?-Yes.

15,280. When did you go first?-In 1858.

15,281. Did you go as a green hand then?-Yes.

15,282. Where did you get your outfit?-From Mr. Leask.

15,283. Did you settle for it at the end of the voyage?-Yes.

15,284. Did you manage to pay it up the first year?-Yes; and I
had 5s. clear.

15,285. Did you ask on that occasion for payment of part of your
earnings in cash?-Yes; when I came home I got the 5s. which I
had clear.  I had had all the rest in goods.

15,286. Did you not want to let part of the goods stand on an
account?-No.

15,287. You wanted to pay it all up and to be clear?-Yes.

15,288. Did you continue to engage with Mr. Leask for some years
after that?-For two years; and then I went to Mr. Tait.

15,289. Why did you go to him then?-Partly because I wanted a
longer voyage; I wanted to go to Davis Straits.

15,290. Had Mr. Leask no ships going the long voyage that
year?-Yes.

15,291. Could you not have got a berth from him?-Yes, if I had
asked for it.

15,292. Why did you not ask for it?-I did not just incline.

15,293. Why did you not incline?-I had no particular reason for
it.

15,294. Had you run up an account with Mr. Leask the year
before?-Yes.

15,295. Had you left him clear?-Yes; and I had got £2 in cash.

15,296. Had you a second payment of oil-money to get that
year?-Yes.

15,297. Did you get payment of that in money?-Yes.

15,298. Was that before or after you had engaged with Mr. Tait?-
It was before.

15,299. How long did you continue with Mr. Tait?-I went five
voyages with him.

15,300. Did you get all your supplies during that time from him?-
Yes, whatever I asked or wanted.

15,301. Did you always get your balances paid to you in cash?-
Yes.

15,302. Had you no difficulty in getting that?-No; whenever I
asked them I always got them.

15,303. Were you not sometimes asked to take them in goods?-
No.  They would ask you if you wanted anything, but that was all;
and I got my things as good there as at any other place.

15,304. Had you not, in one of these years, to ask more than once
for the money?-No, not to my recollection.  If I asked for the
money I always got it.

15,305. Was it paid to you in Mr. Tait's office beside the shop?-
Yes.  I went through the shop into the office, and Mr. Tait settled
with me there.

15,306. Did he or any of his people always ask you if you wanted
any goods when you went to get your settlement?-No, he did not
ask me; but sometimes they would ask me if I wanted anything
when I came out from settlement.  We could either take it or leave
it, any way we liked.

15,307. In some of these years, were there a great number of men
going to Greenland?-Yes.

15,308. Were there sometimes more than there were berths for?-
Yes.

15,309. But you never lost a berth?-No; whenever I asked it I got
it.

15,310. Were you not known to the agents to be a good seaman,
and were you not always on good terms with them?-I never was
on bad terms with them, and I always got a berth when I wanted it.

15,311. But you always had an account with your agent?-Yes.

15,312. And a good lot of supplies?-Sometimes not very much,
but sometimes I had a good lot.

15,313. Do you think the fact of your having a pretty large account
had anything to do with your always getting a berth?-I don't
think it.  Sometimes I would have a good account with one agent,
and go to another agent and get a ship from him.

15,314. Did you not always take your supplies principally from
the agent with whom you were engaging for the year?-Yes,
principally.

15,315. You were five years with Mr. Tait; that would be down to
1866: who did you go to then?-I went back to Mr. Leask.

15,316. Have you been engaged with him ever since?-No; I was
with Mr. Tulloch in 1868.

15,317. Why did you leave Mr. Leask at that time?-I don't know.
 The ship was not in that I was going with, and I just shipped in
another one.

15,318. Did you take your supplies from Mr. Tulloch that year?-
Yes, whatever small things I wanted.

15,319. Had you been quite clear with Mr. Leask the year before,
and got payment of your balance in money?-Yes.  I got paid in
the Custom House that year.

15,320. Was the amount of your account at Mr. Leask's shop
deducted when they paid you at the Custom House?-Yes.

15,321. Then it was merely the balance that was paid to you
there?-No; I got the full amount, and paid them back.

15,322. Did you go down to the shop and pay them back there?-
Yes.

15,323. Had you seen your account at the shop before?-Yes.

15,324. Is that the way in which you have been settled with ever
since?-Yes.

15,325. You see your account beforehand, and then go up to the
Custom House, get payment of the cash, and then you bring down
the money and settle your account?-Yes.

15,326. When you left the shop after seeing your account and went
up to the Custom House, were you told to come back and pay your
account the same day?-Yes.

15,327. You were always reminded of that?-Yes.

15,328. And when you came back to pay your account, were you
asked if you wanted any more goods?-No.  I did not buy anything
unless I chose.

15,329. Do you generally get your last payment of oil-money in
cash, or in goods?-In cash; but if I want them, I can get it in
goods.

15,330. Do you sometimes want it in goods?-Sometimes we may
take some trifling things on it if we want them, but if not we get it
all in money.

15,331. Have you any reason to complain of having to go to the
Custom House and then to go down to the shop and pay your
money?-No.


Lerwick, January 30, 1872, JAMES COUTTS, recalled.

15,332. You have now produced to me the book containing
your transactions in the brokery line: are all [Page 388] your
transactions in that business entered there?-Yes, so far as I know.

15,333. These transactions do not appear to have amounted, on
the whole, to more than two or three per month on an average?-
There might be that in some months, but in other months there
would be nothing.  It was a rare case when I bought anything in
that way at all; it was merely when anything was brought to me
that I thought worth buying.

15,334. Were these articles paid for in cash or in provisions?-
In cash first, and then the people might spend it in provisions
afterwards.  I have seen me get all the money back again before
they went out.

15,335. Have you known many instances of knitters bringing
goods or articles of dress to you and selling them?-I never
questioned them about that.  If they came with an article, I asked
their name and the price, but that was all.  I have also asked them
if they were sure it was not stolen; I was very particular about that.

15,336. Have they ever told you that the goods they were selling
were goods that they had got for knitting?-I recollect them saying
once or twice that they had taken them for their hosiery, but they
took money from me when I bought the goods from them.

15,337. But they told you they had got these goods for hosiery?-
They had perhaps got them out of certain shops; but I believe they
had generally got them on credit, until they had something made
which would pay for them.

15,338. Were these women employed in knitting?-Yes; but there
were only one or two cases of that kind.

15,339. But you have known two or three cases in which women,
known to you to be knitters, came with goods in that way and sold
them?-Yes, they would say they had got them from so and so; but
I don't recollect any particular party.

15,340. Can you point to any of these transactions in the book?-
No; I don't recollect whether the articles that were entered in the
book were got from knitters or from other parties.  Sometimes they
wanted cash for their goods, because they could not get cash at the
shop where they were dealing.

15,341. But, in these circumstances, the people who were refused
the cash got the goods, as you understood at the time?-Yes, I
understood so.

15,342. And they took the goods, and brought them to you and got
the cash?-Yes.

15,343. Did you know that these goods were got at a shop where
hosiery was taken?-I cannot tell; I never asked about that.  They
may have said so but perhaps that might have been false.

15,344. Did they give the name of any party from whom they had
got the goods?-No; they just said they had got the goods when
they could not get the cash.

15,345. May that have been said half a dozen times?-Not so
many.  I only recollect hearing of it once or twice.

15,346. Do you say that it has not happened half a dozen times in
the ten or eleven years that you have been in business?-I don't
recollect it happening so often as that.  I just recollect hearing it
spoke about.

15,347. Do people sometimes come to you yet offering articles for
sale, although you have given up that part of your business?-Yes,
occasionally; but not so much now as before I gave it up.

15,348. Do you not sometimes take them still?-I don't think I
have taken any since the 1st entry in the book on April 15, 1870.

15,349. Are you quite sure that you have never bought any article
at all in your shop since then?-Not that I recollect.

15,350. Would you be likely to forget if you had done it?-I don't
know; but I have not done it, so far as my recollection goes.  I
have once bought a jacket which I wore myself; but it was from a
friend, a party that I knew, and it was not a thing that I was in the
way of buying.

15,351. Can you swear that you have not had more than half a
dozen applications, in the whole course of your business, from
women whom you knew or supposed to be knitters, asking you to
give them money or provisions for goods which they had got for
their hosiery?-They never asked provisions for them.  If they
wanted provisions, they took them out afterwards; they just asked
for the cash, and I gave them what I thought the article was worth
to me.

15,352. Do you swear that you have not had more than half a
dozen such applications in the course of your business?-I don't
recollect more than one or two.  Of course, I did not ask them
pointedly where they had got the articles, or how they had got
them, except merely that I wished to know that the articles had
not been got in a dishonest way.

15,353. But I see that a great number of the entries in the book
relate to transactions with females?-Yes.

15,354. Can you swear that the majority of these women were not
knitters who were in the habit of dealing with hosiery shops, and
who came to you and got cash for the goods which they had got
there?-That might have been so, but I really cannot say.

15,355. Can you swear that one out of every two of these women
did not come and sell goods to you which she had got in that
way?-She might have got them in that way, but I cannot tell.

15,356. Were most of the purchases which you made, of new
articles or of old?-The greater part of the things had been worn.

15,357. Do you think there was any other way in which the
women got these articles, except by getting them from the hosiery
shops?-Certainly.

15,358. Were there some of them which had been got at the
agents' shops where the women were supplied, while the men
were away at the fishing?-They might have had accounts at these
shops, and got goods there in part payment for the men's wages.


Lerwick, January 30, 1872, Mrs. BARBARA DALZELL, examined.


15,359. Do you live in Scalloway Road, Lerwick?-Yes.

15,360. Have you been in the habit of knitting and selling your
goods, or have you knitted with your own wool?-I have both
knitted with merchants' wool and with wool of my own.

15,361. Have you knitted for a long time, and had a great deal
of experience in it?-I have knitted for about thirty-two or
thirty-three years.  During that time I have knitted mostly with
my own wool.

15,362. How have you been paid for your hosiery?-Either in
money or goods.

15,363. Have you ever been paid altogether in money?-Yes,
often.

15,364. Is it not the usual way in Lerwick to pay for hosiery in
goods only?-Yes, that is generally the way in which most of them
do.

15,365. Why has an exception been made in your case?-I don't
think any exception has been made with me.  Whenever I brought
a good article to the merchants I asked money for it, and when I
thought it was an inferior article I never thought of asking for
money.

15,366. Was it generally very fine articles that you knitted?-Not
particularly fine, but I have sometimes knitted very fine articles.

15,367. Was it only for the very fine articles that you got the
money?-It was only for them that I asked the money.

15,368. How much was the largest sum you got at one time?-I
think I have got as much as £5 at one time from Mr. Arthur
Laurenson, but I am not sure; his books will show.

15,369. Did you get that money for one article?-Not for one
article.  It was for a number.

15,370. Was it on an account with him that you got that?-Yes;
but I do not remember the exact sum.

[Page 389]

15,371. What did you get it for?-There was a cloak and several
other articles, and the balances upon several shawls which I had
been leaving with him.

15,372. For what purpose did you get so much money?-I cannot
remember exactly.  I had a reason at the time for asking so much,
but I don't remember asking the money when I sold the articles.

15,373. But you had a special reason for wanting that money?-
Yes.  I would rather not mention what it was, unless it is
necessary.

15,374. Did you tell Mr. Laurenson the reason?-Yes.

15,375. Did you get all the money that was due to you at that
time?-Yes.  I sent a girl who was living in my house at the time
to Mr. Laurenson for the cash, and he sent the balance by her, and
a line along with it to show that he had paid it.

15,376. Was there not a discount taken off because you had got it
in cash?-There was nothing taken off.

15,377. What was the next largest sum that you got at any one
time?-I have got £3 at one time from Mr. Robert Linklater.

15,378. Was there any special reason for that?-I got it for a very
fine cloak which I sold to him.

15,379. Did you sell it to him for a money price?-I sold it, and
asked the money, and got it from him there and then.

15,380. Did you ever get as much as that on any other occasion?-
No; but I have often got £2, which is generally considered the
price of a good cloak.

15,381. Did you sell it to them for that in cash?-Yes.

15,382. Did you ever get money when you knitted for any
merchant

15,383. How much did you get then?-I can scarcely remember.
I knitted at one time for Mr. Gilbert Harrison, and I always got
money from him when I asked it, whether it was a large sum or a
small sum.  The firm is now Harrison & Sons, but it was before
young Mr. Harrison's time that I got that money.  I don't think they
deal in hosiery now; at least I have not dealt with them for a long
time.

15,384. Have you dealt with any other merchant and got money in
such large sums as that?-I once had a transaction with Mr. Wm.
Johnston, and I asked in money and £1 in goods, and I got it.

15,385. There was a letter sent to me in which it was stated that
you could tell me a story about a certain merchant in town: do you
know anything about that letter?-No.  I was wondering who had
mentioned my name to you.

15,386. [Shown letter dated 9th January 1872, and signed W.
Linklater.]   Do you know that handwriting?-I do not, but I know
what it refers to.  It was merely a private thing that I was telling to
another party about having taken some hosiery to a merchant.

15,387. Do you know the party who writes the letter?-I don't
think I do.

15,388. What does the letter refer to?-I bought some stockings
from a merchant in Lerwick, and I was selling some shawls to him,
but he did not like to take hosiery in return for his stockings.  He
said he would take one half money and one half shawls, and I went
home, and I think it was either 20s. or 30s. that I got from my
husband to pay one half of the price.

15,389. What quantity of hosiery had you bought?-I think it was
rather more than £2 worth.

15,390. Was that for your own family?-No.  It was for a
party who had sent to me for some hosiery, and I went to that
merchant's shop for it.

15,391. Do you sometimes deal in hosiery yourself?-I sometimes
send work south, but I oftener sell it here.  It is a long time since
that affair happened; and I think the price came to nearly £3, but I
don't remember the amount.

15,392. How long ago was it?-Perhaps 12 years ago, or perhaps
not so much.

15,393. Was it the practice at that time, as it is now, to pay for
hosiery in goods?-Yes.

15,394. But when you bought hosiery, was it understood you were
to pay for it in cash?-There was no understanding about it.  I just
went to the shop for the stockings, and the merchant agreed to take
one half of the payment in hosiery and the other half in cash,
which I paid to him.  I asked his reason for doing that, and he said
that by taking the hosiery it was turning his goods twice over for
only one profit.

15,395. Was that the only transaction you ever had with that
merchant?-I had plenty of transactions with him before, but
not many after.

15,396. Do you sometimes buy a great quantity of wool?-Yes;
but it is very difficult to get the best wool.

15,397. Where do you buy it?-Sometimes from country
merchants, generally from Fetlar.  I get some worsted from
William Tulloch, Fetlar.  I generally pay 4d. a cut for it.  The
finest is 6d. a cut; that is the kind which is used in making fine
shawls and fine cloaks in Shetland.

15,398. You don't buy it in wool yourself, but in worsted?-Yes.
There are some of the people in Lerwick who buy it in fine wool,
and send it to the country to be spun, before they can get it really
fine.

15,399. Are they not able to buy the finest worsted in the shops in
Lerwick?-I never could do so.


Lerwick, January 30, 1872, GEORGE JAMIESON, examined.

15,400. Have you a farm at North Roe, on the estate of Busta?-
Yes.  I have only had one crop there.

15,401. Have you been a fisherman?-Yes, all my life.

15,402. Whom did you fish for?-I have fished for different
people in my time.  When I was on Messrs. Hay's property I fished
for them; but they suspended me from fishing, and I would not go
again.  They wanted to put me into a boat with some old men.  I
would not agree to that, and I lost my fishing for four years.

15,403. Were you at liberty to fish for whom you pleased?-I was
not.  They stopped other fish-curers from taking me during these
four years.

15,404. How did they do that?-I offered to go for different men,
and they would not take me for fear of Mr. Greig, Messrs. Hay's
factor at North Roe.

15,405. Are the tenants on the Gossaburgh estate bound to fish for
Messrs. Hay & Co.?-Yes.  I was bound to do so all the time I was
there.  One year I agreed with Mr. Anderson, Hillswick, to go to
the fishing for him, and I came with my share of fishing lines, but
he would not give his men a share of lines to make up the fishing
with; and he gave us an old boat that we would not risk our lives
in, and he would not give us any meal.

15,406. Are you also employed in keeping paupers?-Yes, I
have two old women-one from the parish of Lerwick, and
one from the parish of Northmaven.  I have £8 for the one from
Northmaven.  I only had 13s. for five months for the pauper who
belonged to Lerwick, but now they have given me 1s. 6d. a week,
which comes to £3, 18s. a year.

15,407. Who pays you these sums?-Mr. Greig.

15,408. Does he pay you for both the paupers?-Yes.

15,409. Does he keep the post office?-No; but they put the
money into his hands, and most of it has been taken out in truck.
He refuses to give me any money except a mere trifle.

15,410. Whom did you make your bargain about these paupers
with?-One was with Mr. Johnston of Lerwick, and the other
was with Mr. Bruce at Urrafirth.

15,411. Do you not receive post-office orders or money from Mr.
Bruce or Mr. Johnston for the maintenance of these paupers?-It
comes to Mr. Greig; I cannot say how it comes.

15,412. Have you ever asked that the money should be sent to you
direct?-No.

15,413. Is Mr. Greig a member of the parochial board of
Northmaven parish?-I believe he is.

[Page 390]

15,414. But he is not a member of the Lerwick parochial board?-
No.

15,415. How does he happen to pay you money for Lerwick
parish?-They send it to him.

15,416. Have you ever asked him for the whole of that money in
cash?-No.

15,417. Why?-Because he seemed that he would not pay it in
cash.

15,418. How did he seem so?-He said he would not do so, and
that there was no use of him taking the trouble if I would not take
the greater part of it out in truck.

15,419. When did he say that to you?-He has said it to me
several times.  He said it some time after I got the first pauper,
who belonged to Northmaven.  That is about two years back.

15,420. Did he say it to you when you went for the first
payment?-Yes.

15,421. Had you not run up an account at his shop before the
money was due?-I had not.

15,422. Did you owe him anything then?-I owed him nothing.
He was my landmaster then, but I did not owe him anything.

15,423. Is that money paid quarterly?-It is paid monthly here.

15,424. Did you ever ask Mr. Greig for a monthly payment in
cash?-I did not.

15,425. Why?-I cannot tell.  I suppose it was because we always
had his shop to go to for things that we required for the paupers,
and we thought we need not ask for cash.

15,426. Were you not always due him as much as the monthly
payment before it became due?-I was not.

15,427. Were you not due him something?-Yes, a small thing,
but not the whole of the money.

15,428. Did you ever ask him for the balance in money?-Yes.

15,429. Did you get it?-Yes.

15,430. Then, when was it that Mr. Greig said he could not give
it to you in money, but that you must take it out in truck?-Just
when they sent the paupers to me.

15,431. Are you sure there was not something due to Mr. Greig
then for supplies to the paupers?-There was nothing due.

15,432. Had you not got any supplies from him for these women
before the first payment was due?-Yes, I got what I wanted
whenever I asked it.

15,433. Then there was something due to him for that?-Yes; he
never refused to give me anything for them as soon as I came for
it.

15,434. There was something due to him for these supplies at the
time when the first monthly payment became due?-Yes, but not
to the whole amount of it.

15,435. Why did you say that you were not due him anything?-I
had to take out the things because I could not get the money.

15,436. Did you ask him for the balance?-I did.

15,437. How much was there due to you at that time?-I cannot
tell, because we don't keep accounts.

15,438. Have you no pass-book?-No.

15,439. Did Mr. Greig actually say to you that you must take your
payment in truck?-He said we must take part of it in truck, and
that he would not pay it all in money.

15,440. Did he use the word truck?-Yes.

15,441. Did he not say that you were to take part of it in goods?-
Goods were the same as truck, and he meant that we were to take
meal or tea, or anything, out of his shop.

15,442. But what did he actually say?-He said we must take
goods out of his shop for part of the money, because he could not
pay it all in money.  He said that the first time I went to him.

15,443. When did he say it again?-He said it very often.

15,444. When did he say it last?-This winter.

15,445. Where did he say it?-In his shop at North Roe.

15,446. Were you asking for money at that time?-Yes.  I asked
him then for the 13s. which came for the pauper from Lerwick,
and he said he would give me that, but that he need not have the
trouble of paying it all down in money.

15,447. Had you not got a lot of supplies at that time?-No.

15,448. Do you swear that, when you asked him for the 13s., you
were owing him nothing for supplies?-I was owing him nothing.

15,449. Had you got any supplies from him before that?-I had got
nothing from him for the pauper from Lerwick.

15,450. But had you got supplies for your own household?-I had;
but I was due him nothing.

15,451. Had all the supplies that you had got from Mr. Greig for
other parties up to that time been paid for?-They were all paid
for when I asked for the 13s.

15,452. Had you any account due at the-shop at that time?-I
cannot tell.  I don't think it.  There could be nothing due.

15,453. You said just now that all the supplies you had ever got
were paid for at that time?-They were paid for.

15,454. And then you say in the next sentence that you cannot say
whether they were paid for or not?-I asked for nothing for this
woman until the came.

15,455. Do you keep a separate account for every woman that you
have?-I believe we do.

15,456. Do you know anything about your accounts?-I don't
know a great deal about them.

15,457. Are you sure that Mr. Greig has told you that you must
take part of your payment for the paupers in goods?-Yes.

15,458. Is not all that he has done merely to keep part of the
money that was already due to him for supplies which you had
got?-He said he would not pay it all in money.  That is all I
have got to say about it.

15,459. Did he not say that he would not give it all to you in
money because you were due him something for supplies you
had already got?-I was never due Mr. Greig anything.

15,460. Had you not got supplies from him before he said that?-I
had got supplies, but they never ran up to the sum which I had to
get payment of from him.  There was always money due to me.

15,461. Were you ever due Mr. Greig anything at all?-I was not.

15,462. Did you not owe him money for the supplies you had
got?-We never sought supplies that would run up to the sum
which we had to get.  There was always something in his hand.

15,463. Do you understand what it is to be due a man money?-
Yes.

15,464. Do you understand that you are due a man money when
you have got goods from him and not paid for them?-I know that.

15,465. Were you not due Mr. Greig money when you had got
these goods and had not paid for them?-I was.

15,466. Was it not at the time when you were due him money for
these supplies that he said he could not give you the money which
was due for the paupers?-He said, first of all, that we were not to
ask all money when we were due him for goods.

15,467. Is there anything else you wish to say?-Nothing.

15,468. You have given your evidence in such a manner, that I
cannot allow you any expenses for attending here.


Lerwick, January 30, 1872, ROBERT IRVINE, examined.

15,469. Are you a broker in Lerwick?-I am a general dealer.  I
deal in new as well as second-hand goods.

[Page 391]

15,470. Do you deal in provisions?-Very little; mostly in soft
goods.

15,471. Do you make many purchases of soft goods and wearing
apparel over your counter?-Of wearing apparel, but not of
hosiery.

15,472. Do you sometimes purchase articles which are not made
up, such as cotton?-Yes, and new articles too.  If a man buys an
article that does not fit him, and he comes back to me with it, I
will take it from him and sell him another, or give him the cash.

15,473. Is this [showing] the book in which you enter all your
transactions?-Yes.

15,474. Are women in the practice of selling goods to you which
they have got in the shops?-There is very little of that done.  I
cannot say that I ever recollect a case of it.

15,475. Have you many transactions with women?-Very few.  It
is mostly men's apparel that I get.

15,476. I see that in your book most of the entries are in the names
of men?-Yes; I always deal with men, except on rare occasions.

15,477. Are you the only broker of this kind in Lerwick?-I think I
am the principal one; I have a licence as a broker.

15,478. Can you say that you have not had any transactions with
women who might have been knitters, and who were disposing of
goods which they had got for their hosiery?-I cannot tell exactly.
Sometimes they may have come in with goods which they had got
in that way, but it is very little of that kind of thing that comes my
way.

15,479. Have you had many dealings with women whom you knew
to be knitters?-Very few.  I don't know that I recollect a single
case.  As I have said, it is generally men's work that I get.

15,480. Do you enter every transaction which you have in the book
which you have produced?-Every one.

15,481. Is it not possible that some purchases of that kind from
women are not entered in it?-No; I do not want to omit them,
because I want to punish them if they are rogues.

15,482. But these women will be perfectly honest in making such
sales?-Yes, but I don't think there has ever been such a case in
my business.

15,483. Have you ever bought any lines from women?-I never
saw one offered; and even if it had been offered, I would not have
bought it or meddled with it at all.

15,484. Do you know anything at all about the lines?-I don't
recollect ever seeing one in my life because I am not in the way
of it.

15,485. Have you heard of them?-I have heard of them
repeatedly.

15,486. I suppose the trade of a broker is not a very flourishing one
in Lerwick?-No, it is very dull; but I am a dealer also, and can
make up things otherwise, which helps me through.

15,487. Do you know whether that business of buying second-hand
articles is practised by any people who act as hawkers and who
hawk through the country?-I don't know of any people who do
that.


Lerwick, January 30, 1872, FRANCIS GIFFORD, examined.

15,488. Are you a seaman, living in Bressay?-I am.

15,489. Have you gone on sealing and whaling voyages for a good
many years?-Yes, I went there during the first years of my time,
and then I went south; but afterwards I have been at the sealing
and whaling again.

15,490. Have you always engaged with some agent in Lerwick?-
Yes, I have engaged with them all except Mr. Tulloch; I never
went out from him.

15,491. Have you always received payment of your wages on your
return from the voyage?-Yes, for the last three or four years I
have always got my money at the Custom House.

15,492. Before the regulations were introduced according to which
you were paid at the Custom House, did you settle with the agent
at his shop?-Yes.

15,493. Did you always get your money on these occasions?-Not
exactly.

15,494. Had you an account then for outfit and supplies?-Yes.

15,495. Did you always get the balance that was due?-Yes, I got
it, but very little money.

15,496. Was that because you had a large account?-I don't know.

15,497. Do you remember some years ago being engaged by Mr.
Joseph Leask on a voyage to what is called the west-ice?-Yes.

15,498. Is that in Davis Straits?-No, it is to the northward.

15,499. Do you remember applying for your wages in money in
that year?-Yes.

15,500. Did you get it at once whenever you asked for it?-Yes.

15,501. Did you sail in the same vessel again that year?-Yes; but
Mr. Leask was not for me going in her again, because I had got my
money.  If it had not been for the captain I would not have got with
the vessel, but he said he would have me.  The vessel was the
'Camperdown,' and that occurred in 1866.

15,502. What was Mr. Leask's reason for not engaging you for that
vessel?-I don't know.

15,503. You said it was because you got your money?-I believe
Mr. Leask thought I was for the double voyage, but I was only for
the single voyage; and when I came home after the first voyage I
got settled with him, because at that time I was intending to go
south.  I came over and got my money, but before the end of the
week the vessel returned again, going to Davis Straits, and I went
up to see if I could get a chance to go in her.  When Captain Bruce
told me to go and get my things and come with the vessel again,
Mr. Leask was wild, and said I should not get a chance.

15,504. Had you intended at first not to go on the second voyage
that year?-I was anxious to go but I did not know that the Captain
was to put me down for the double voyage.

15,505. Why was Mr. Leask wild?-I don't know; I suppose it was
because he thought I was only for the single voyage, and I came
over and got my money.

15,506. Would he not have given you your money if he had known
you were going the other voyage?-I believe he would not.

15,507. How did you happen to ask for your money at that time?
Is it not usual to ask for it after the first voyage?-When the men
go for a single voyage, which lasts for about six weeks, they are
cleared off when they go home; but when they go for the double
voyage they cannot get their money until the end of the season.
Mr. Leask thought I was shipped for the double voyage and that I
would come over and draw the whole of my money at one time;
but of course I did not know myself that I was for the double
voyage until the captain came again and put me down for it.

15,508. Do men never draw their money at the end of the first
voyage except when they are done with the ship for that season?-
They do it now.  As soon as their six weeks are over and they
come back again, they draw their money; but they did not do that
before.

15,509. Was it always the practice before to make only one
settlement for the long voyage?-Yes.

15,510. Have you always got your money since 1866?-Yes.

15,511. Have you also incurred an account at the same time with
the agent who engaged you?-Yes.

15,512. How is it settled?-It was settled at the end of the season.

15,513. Was it read over to you before you went up to the Custom
House to get payment of your money?-Yes.

15,514. Was the balance written out in the books before you went
up?-Yes.

[Page 392]

15,515. You went up and got your money from the Custom House
from the agent or his clerk, and then you came down to the shop
and paid your account?-Yes.

15,516. When you went to the shop in the first place, were you
always told to come back and pay your account?-Yes.

15,517. Who tells you to do that?-The agent.

15,518. Have you always had your account clear at the end of the
season, or have you sometimes been in debt to the shop?-I have
always been clear.

15,519. Do you know that young hands are sometimes in debt to
the shop at the end of the season?-Yes.

15,520. Has there sometimes been a difficulty in getting berths in
the sealing and whaling vessels, in consequence of more men
applying than were wanted?-Yes.

15,521. What kind of men are preferred in such circumstances;
is it the best quality of men?-There are generally all sorts of
hands-green hands, and able seamen, and ordinary seamen of all
kinds.

15,522. When a man is in debt to an agent, do you think he has
any better chance of getting a berth?-My partners think so.  They
think that if a man is in debt the agent will perhaps try to get him
into a vessel, in order that he may be able to clear off his debt.

15,523. Do you know that they have done that?-Yes, I have seen
it.

15,524. What have you seen?-I have seen agents getting men
who were in their debt put into their ships.

15,525. Have you heard the captains complaining of the agents
putting inferior men upon them for that reason?-I have.  Captain
Bruce of the 'Camperdown,' complained about that in 1866.  He
said to the men that Mr. Leask was putting hands into the ship that
he did not like, and that he would have liked better hands.

15,526. Did he state the reason why he supposed Mr. Leask was
doing that?-He did not tell us about the reason.

15,527. Then how did you know that that was the reason why Mr.
Leask had put in inferior hands?-I knew they were men who were
in debt to him.

15,528. Did you know that from the men themselves?-Yes, I
knew it from several men; but I don't remember their names-
they were men on board the 'Camperdown' that year along with
me.

15,529. Did they tell you that their being in debt had given them a
better chance of a berth?-Yes; and that when they were in debt
they got a ship.

15,530. Was that a general understanding among them?-Yes.

15,531. Did you know of any better men who wished to go in that
ship, but who were refused because they were not in debt?-No;
but I know that if men are debt to the agent they will get a ship
sooner than those who are clear with him.

15,532. But you have always got a ship although you were not in
debt?-Yes.

15,533. Are you an able seaman?-Yes, I am a boat-steerer.

15,534. Do harpooneers and boat-steerers get a higher wage, and
are they more sure of getting a berth than ordinary seamen?-Yes,
they get higher wages, and are more in demand.

15,535. On the occasion you spoke of, when you went in the
'Camperdown' with Captain Bruce, it was to the captain that
you owed your engagement, and not to the agent?-Yes.

15,536. If the agent had had his own way, would you have been
engaged?-I would not.

15,537. Had you an account with the agent at that time?-No, I
had some more money to get from him.

15,538. Had he not paid you up the whole of the money that
was due to you on the sealing voyage?-No; there was a second
payment of oil-money which I had to get.

15,539. Is it quite understood among the whalers, that when their
money is paid to them at the Custom House they have to go down
to the shops and pay it to the agents?-Yes; they quite understand
that they have to clear the agent's books.

15,540. I suppose a man would not think of letting his account
stand any longer?-No.

15,541. What would be the consequence if he did that?-I cannot
say.

15,542. Would he get a berth next year?-He might get a berth
next year, but it is best to have the books cleared.

15,543. But suppose a man had other accounts due, would he have
to go and pay the agent first, and let his other accounts wait?-I
don't know about that.

15,544. Does not a man go and pay the agent first, whether he has
other people wanting his money or not?-As a rule, they go and
pay the agent first.

15,545. Have you heard any of the men complain that they had to
pay the agents in preference to other accounts which they wished
to settle?-No.


Lerwick, January 30, 1872, PETER HALCROW, examined.

15,546. Are you a seaman?-Yes.

15,547. Have you gone on sealing and whaling voyages for some
years back?-Yes, for nine years.

15,548. What agents in Lerwick have you been engaged by?-The
whole of them.

15,549. Did you always get your outfit from the agent you engaged
with?-Yes, the most part of it.

15,550. And you settled your account with him at the end of the
year?-Yes.

15,551. Had you always a balance to receive in money?-
Generally.  Once I had not; that was in my second year.

15,552. Have you always got any money that was due to you paid
in cash?-No.

15,553. When did you not?-The first year I was out.

15,554. Was there something due to you that year?-Yes,

15,555. Did you ask for it to be paid to you?-Yes, at different
times; but I did not get it.  I was told that the agent had not got it
himself, and that therefore I could not get it.

15,556. When did you return that year?-On 1st October.

15,557. How long was it after that before you got your money
paid?-I never got it paid at all.  I had to take goods for it out of
Mr. Leask's shop.

15,558. Were you told to take goods?-No, he did not tell me to
take them; but I had to take them when I could not get the money.
I was in need of them.

15,559. Did you want the goods?-Yes, I was requiring things, and
I got them there.

15,560. Did he say that you had better take goods, as the money
had not come?-No, he did not say that.  He only said it was not
come every time I came and asked for it, and as I could not wait
longer I just took the things I had to get.

15,561. How long was it after you returned before you began to
take the goods?-About a month or five weeks.

15,562. How often had you asked for the money within that
time?-Three or four times.

15,563. Were you offered the goods?-No, I was never offered
them until I asked for them.

15,564. Did you say anything about not getting your money to the
agent or any of his people?-No, I did not say anything.

15,565. Are you sure there was £4 due to you at that time?-
There was £4, 10s. due when we left home from the owners, and
30s. from the Shipwrecked Mariners' Fund, because we were
shipwrecked.

15,566. Then there was no oil-money that year?-None.

15,567. Did you not get the payment from the Shipwrecked
Mariners' Fund in cash?-No.

15,568. Did you apply for it in cash?-Yes; I applied at the shop
for it, and I got a very little cash, perhaps about £1 at one time and
another-not all at once.

[Page 393]

15,569. Have you ever taken part of your earnings in goods since
then?-Yes, I have done so almost every year that I have been out.

15,570. But that was just in the account which you opened when
you went away?-Yes.

15,571. Did your people get any advances when you were absent
from the agent with whom you shipped?-Yes; a little.

15,572. And they get any supplies anywhere else?-They generally
got them from the agent.

15,573. Why was that?-I don't know; they just got them there.

15,574. Do you not get a month's advance when you leave?-We
get a month's advance now.  We don't get the money before we
leave, but we get a ticket to be paid three days after the ship sails.
We generally give it to the agent, and get a little money on it, but
not to the full amount of the advance.

15,575. Do you not leave that ticket at home?-Some of the men
leave them at home, and the value of them is got afterwards.

15,576. Why do you not do that?-Because I may want the money
before I go away, and I get a part of it from the agent.

15,577. In that case you have to leave your ticket with the
agent?-Yes, we have to give it up to him.

15,578. Do you not get allotment tickets when you leave?-I don't
know them.

15,579. Can you not get half-pay tickets if you want them?-Yes.

15,580. Is it not the practice to get them?-Sometimes they get
them if they ask for them.

15,581. Do you take them?-No.

15,582. Why?-I don't know.   We generally just get what we
want in money or in goods, as we ask for it.

15,583. Do the agents give these half-pay tickets whenever they
are asked for?-Yes.

15,584. Would they prefer you not to take them, but to take goods
instead?-I don't know about that.  I have not been told so.

15,585. Did you hear the evidence of Francis Gifford?-Yes.

15,586. Do you think what he said was generally correct?-I think
so.

15,587. Was he correct in what he said about a man who was in
debt to the agent getting a berth more readily than another?-Yes.

15,588. Have you known that in your own experience?-I got a
ship when I was in debt in my second year.

15,589. Do you think you got it more easily because you were in
debt?-I cannot say for that.

15,590. Have you heard men speaking about getting a ship more
easily when they were in debt?-I have heard them talking about
it, but still I don't know about it myself except on that one
occasion.

15,591. Have you known any case like that which Francis Gifford
mentioned, of inferior men being put on board a ship because they
were in the agent's debt, in preference to better men?-I never
knew of that, but still it may have happened.  I wish to say that in
1866 I shipped in the 'Diana' of Hull, for the west ice in Davis
Straits, and when we were out I was beset in her for thirteen
months, and for seven months we were on short allowance.  We
have never been paid for that short allowance, although the men
in Hull were paid for it.

15,592. Have you applied for that?-There is a man here who has
applied for it.  I think he applied to Mr. Charles Duncan, writer,
and also to the sheriff.

15,593. Who was the agent from whom you thought you should
have got it?-Mr. Leask.

15,594. Did you apply to him for the difference which you ought
to have got in consequence of being put upon short allowance?-
Yes; and he told us it was no use applying for it, because he did
not think we would get it.  I never asked Mr. Leask about that
myself, but other men in Lerwick have done it.

15,595. Did they mention to him that the Hull men had got the
difference paid to them?-Yes.

15,596. Did Mr. Leask offer to do anything for you in that case?-
Not as far as I know; but I was away from home at the time when
the men applied for it.

15,597. Do you think that has anything to do with your dealings
at Mr. Leask's shop?-I don't think so, but I suppose Mr. Leask
could have applied for it if he had liked.

15,598. Had you an account with him that year which you settled
as usual at the end of the season?-Yes.

15,599. Did you not apply for the difference on the short
allowance when you were settling that account?-Yes.  They
told me then that they did not know but what they might get it
for us, but still they did not say that we would get it, and it has
not come yet.


Lerwick, January 30, 1872, WILLIAM LAURENSON, examined.

15,600. Are you a seaman living in Bressay?-Yes.  I have been at
the sealing and whaling for thirty-six years.  I have got settled, and
got my wages paid to me at the Custom House for some years
back, but that was not done when I first went.

15,601. Before you were paid at the Custom House, did you not
get payment of your wages?-I got no satisfaction of them.  I very
often did not see an account.  I would come over from Bressay two
or three different times wanting to get settled, but they would
shove me off time after time, giving me perhaps 10s. or £1; but
they would not settle with me.

15,602. Were you owing an account for supplies at that time?-
I got supplies from the shop when I went on the voyage, but I
always had balances of money to get.  I never was in debt.

15,603. By what agents were you treated in that way?-They are
long dead now.

15,604. Did that not continue till 1867, when the new regulations
came into force, according to which you were paid at the Custom
House?-Yes; the system continued much the same until then.

15,605. Were you put off in the same way from time to time down
till 1867?-Yes; perhaps getting £1 or 10s. now and again.

15,606. What agents were you engaged by, five or six years ago?-
I was engaged by Mr. Tait, and I was three years for Mr. Tulloch;
but I was paid at the Custom House then.

15,607. Were you often engaged by Mr. Tait before 1867?-I
would be engaged by him perhaps two years at a time, and then I
would leave him and go to another, and then go back to him again.

15,608. Who else did you engage with?-I went out a long time
for Messrs. Hay, and I was with Mr. Leask too.

15,609. When you went, until five years ago, to get a settlement of
your account, were you always put off with £1 or 10s., or some
supplies, if you wanted them?-I was put off now and again.

15,610. Did all the agents who employed you treat you in the same
way?-Almost every one.

15,611. Did you not get a settlement with Messrs. Hay when you
asked for it?-Yes; I got a fair settlement with Messrs. Hay when I
went out from their shop.

15,612. Were you ever put off in the way you have mentioned
when you were engaged by them?-No; and I was engaged by
them for ten years.

15,613. When you went to Mr. Tait, did he settle with you when
you asked for it, even before the new system?-Yes.

15,614. Did he ever put you off in that way?-No.  I was out of his
shop when his father was alive, and he settled with me in the same
way.

15,615. Had you ever to ask him twice for your money?-No.

15,616. Did you get a settlement whenever you went there for
it?-Yes.

15,617. Did you always get your money in full when you went
over to ask for it from Mr. Leask?-I got what was due to me; but
I generally had some things out of the shop before I went, and then
I got the balance.

[Page 394]

15,618. Could you always get it at once without any difficulty?-
Yes; I just asked for it and I got it.

15,619. Then who were the agents who put you off in the way you
mentioned?-They are all dead long ago.

15,620. I thought you said the system of putting you off in that
way, and of giving you £1 or 10s. at a time, continued till about
five or six years ago?-Sometimes it did, and sometimes not.
Some years I never got a fair account, and in other years I did.

15,621. But you always got a fair account from Messrs. Hay?-
Yes.

15,622. And from Mr. Leask?-Yes.

15,623. And from Mr. Tait and Mr. Tulloch?-Yes.

15,624. What agents were there besides these, five or six years
ago?-It is far longer than five or six years since I was put off in
that way, and did not get the settlement when I wanted it.

15,625. Will it be ten years since you asked for your money and
did not get it?-It will be ten years, or above that.

15,626. Will it be fifteen or twenty years ago?-It will be from
fifteen to twenty years.

15,627. Are you a harpooneer or a boat-steerer?-I am a
boat-steerer.

15,628. Did you hear the evidence of Francis Gifford?-Yes.

15,629. Do you think he was generally correct in what he said?-
Yes.  I know quite well that men who were in debt to the agent
could get a ship sooner than I could, who was clear with them.

15,630. Could a man do that although he was not so good a
seaman?-Yes.

15,631. Was that a general belief among the men?-Yes.  For my
part, I never was indebted to any of the agents, and therefore I got
a ship whenever wanted it.

15,632. Did you get a ship because you were not in debt?-Yes; it
did not matter.  I stayed in one ship for a long time.

15,633. Were the agents more willing to get a berth for a man who
was not in their debt?-No.

15,634. Did they prefer to engage a man who was in their debt?-
Yes; but there were not very many that would be in debt.  Perhaps
a young hand, who had been a year or two only at the whaling, and
had small wages, would be in debt, and they would take him next
year in order to clear off the accounts which he had left the year
before.

15,635. Do you think the green hands were ready to get into debt
in order to make sure of getting a berth next year?-I don't know
about that.

15,636. Then what did you mean by saying that you never were in
debt, and therefore you always got berth when you wanted it?-I
only meant to say that always got a ship when I wanted one, but
that I never was in debt to the agents; and therefore I cannot prove
whether they would take me more readily if I was in debt.  But I
have heard the men saying that those who were in debt would be
shipped as soon as the others.


Lerwick, January 30, 1872, ELIZABETH MORRISON, examined.

15,637. Do you live in Lerwick?-Yes.

15,638. What do you do?-Anything that I can.  I go errands or
knit stockings, or anything of that sort.

15,639. Do you sometimes go about selling things?-I have sold
three or four neckties to different people.

15,640. Do you not sell other kinds of goods?-No.  If I sell
anything, it is of my own.

15,641. Do you sell shop goods of different kinds?-No.

15,642. Do you mean that you do not go about the country and
hawk goods?-I don't do that.

15,643. Did you ever get any shop goods from a knitter for the
purpose of selling them or exchanging them for other things?-
No; the neckties I sold I got ready money for.

15,644. It is not neckties I am speaking about at all.  Have you
not sold goods that you had got from knitting women for that
purpose?-No, not for some years past.

15,645. Did you once do that?-Yes, some time ago.

15,646. How long ago?-I cannot remember.

15,647. A year ago?-It is about that.

15,648. Did you not make a living sometimes by getting goods
from knitters and selling them again in the country?-No; I never
was out of Lerwick in my time.

15,649. Did you sell them in Lerwick?-I sold some bits of
dribblets of things that were not worth mentioning; but that
was some time ago.

15,650. What was it that you sold?-It may have been three yards
of cotton, or such as that.

15,651. Did you get such things pretty often from knitters?-No, not often.

15,652. When did you get them last?-It was a long time ago.

15,653. Was it six months ago?-It would be above that.

15,654. Would it be twelve months since you got anything of that
kind to sell?-I cannot say.

15,655. You said you had perhaps sold three yards of cotton:
whom did you sell it for?-I cannot remember.

15,656. Whom did you get it from?-I cannot remember.

15,657. Have you got it more than once?-Perhaps once or twice;
but it is a long time ago now.

15,658. Do you think you may have got it three or four times?-I
don't think I did.

15,659. What else did you get besides the three yards of cotton?-
Nothing.

15,660. Did you never get a bit of cloth for a dress?-No.

15,661. Or a jacket?-No.

15,662. Or a pair of boots?-No.

15,663. Did you ever get any tea or sugar to sell?-No.

15,664. Do you swear that?-I do.

15,665. Do you swear that you never sold a quarter pound of tea in
your life?-I do.

15,666. Did you never sell any sugar?-No.

15,667. Did you ever buy any except out of a shop?-I never
bought any except what I bought out a shop for my ready penny.

15,668. Did you ever tell anybody that you had sold things for
knitters?-No, I could not tell any one that.

15,669. Did you get that cotton from a woman who had got it for
her knitting?-I don't know in what way she may have got it, but I
got it from a woman.   Who she was I cannot say, because she
picked me up in the street and gave it to me.

15,670. Did you get it sold for her?-I did.  I don't remember who
bought it; it was some country person.

15,671. Do you not remember who the woman was that you got it
from?-I cannot remember.

15,672. Did you know her?-I did not know her.

15,673. In what way did she ask you to sell it for her?-She asked
me if I could get anybody to buy it, and I saw a country woman at
my side, and she bought it.

15,674. Why did the woman ask you to get it sold?-I don't know.

15,675. Had you never seen her before?-Neither before nor since.

15,676. Have you any idea why she asked you to sell it?-No, I
have no idea of that.

15,677. Do you think she had ever seen you doing the like
before?-There is many an old person such as me who does
errands for many a one.

15,678. Have you done errands of that kind at other times?-Yes,
years and years ago.

15,679. May you have done so a good many times?-I don't know.
It was very seldom I did it.

15,680. What did you get for that cotton?-I cannot remember
now.

15,681. Was it money you got for it?-Yes.

[Page 395]

15,682. Did you pay the woman you got it from at the time?-Yes.

15,683. Had you not paid her for it before you sold it?-I gave her
the money just as I got it from the woman at my side.

15,684. How long was it between the time when you got the cotton
and the time when you sold it?-Perhaps a minute or five or ten
minutes.  The woman was just at my hand who bought it.

15,685. Why could the woman who gave it to you not have sold it
herself?-I don't know.

15,686. How much did she give you for selling it?-A penny.

15,687. Did you ever get a penny for selling anything else?-No; I
don't work in that way for my living.

15,688. Are you sure you never got a penny for selling any other
article for a woman?-I have got many a penny at different times,
but not in that exact way.

15,689. What else do you do for your living?-I live very meanly.

15,690. But do you never get any more than a penny for doing an
errand now and then?-I have no idea of doing errands only for
my living.

15,691. Is there anything else by which you make a living, except
by going errands?-I am not going errands for ever.  I sometimes
sit and knit a stocking in my own room; that is all I do.

15,692. Do you sell your stockings?-No; they are just for myself.

15,693. Then they will not make it living for you?-No; but
perhaps some of my friends might lift a hand to help me.

15,694. Do you live on charity?-Not altogether on charity.

15,695. You do run an errand for a penny now and then?-No, not
I.

15,696. Why are you reluctant to tell me the truth?-I am not
denying the truth.

15,697. You are not willing to answer my questions: why is
that?-I have answered them so far as I know, and as far as I
am able.  I have no more to say than I have told you, and I have
told you all the truth.

15,698. You say you do not make your living by charity, and you
only get a penny now and then for running errands, but that is very
seldom: is there any other way in which you make your living?-
When a person wishes to lift their hand to me in charity, I take
what they have to give me.

15,699. Do you swear that you don't make the principal part of
your living by selling things in the town?-I don't make my living
by that.

15,700. Do you swear that you don't sell something every day?-I
don't sell something every day.

15,701. Don't you sell two or three things every week?-No; I am
quite sure of that.

15,702. Have you sold anything this week?-No.

15,703. Did you sell anything last week or the week before?-No.

15,704. Did you sell anything last year?-I cannot remember what
I did last year, for my memory is quite gone.


Lerwick, January 30, 1872, WILLIAM B.M. HARRISON, examined.

15,705. Are you a partner of the firm of Harrison & Sons?-I am.

15,706. Your firm, I believe, are extensively engaged in the Faroe
fishing?-Yes.

15,707. In what form is the agreement you enter into with the men
for that fishing?-The men agree, in the first place, to prosecute
the fishing in a certain vessel, and to join the vessel any day when
we may call upon them to do so, and proceed to the fishing to
either Faroe, Iceland, Rockall, or any other place that the master
may think most expedient, and to stay there as long as the master
thinks fit, with the exception of the trips they may make home for
landing any fish they may catch, or in case of accident or for
any other good reason; in consideration of which services the
fishermen have to receive one half of the proceeds of the fish
caught, after deducting the expenses of curing, etc., such as
master's premium, 10s. per ton, mate's premium 2s. 6d. per ton,
and the cost of bait required for catching the fish.  Along with that
the men have to get eight pounds of bread per man per week and
9d. per score for the fish which each man takes, one half to be
paid by the owners and the other half by the crew.  That is the
substance of the agreement.  And then there are clauses for our
safety, having reference to damage that may be done to the vessel
or her gear, which the men bind themselves to pay for.

15,708. Is there a scale of victualling for the men in case the
vessel goes to Iceland?-Yes.  The agreement binds the men to
fish according to it until the 20th August; and the next clause says
that if the master or owner sees fit to leave Faroe for Iceland or for
a late voyage, then the men agree to go upon the victuals and
wages which are stated in the agreement.

15,709. Then in addition to the stipulations in the agreement, I
understand the owner receives a commission of five per cent. on
the whole proceeds of the voyage?-He is entitled to get it if he
can, but very often we don't get it.  This year we have got nothing.

15,710. Was that because the men objected to it?-We always try
to pay as high as other people; but this year we have not made
such good sales, and therefore we have not taken anything off, so
that we might be able to give as much per ton as other people give.
In other years, again, we may get two and a half or we may get five
per cent, just as the fish sales turn out; and the men don't object to
us getting it if we can.

15,711. Why is there no stipulation for a commission put into the
agreement?-It has never been put into our agreements from the
first.

15,712  Is it a usual thing to take it?-Yes, it is quite usual if we
can get it; but we have to bear and haul with other people, and if
the men would be dissatisfied with us taking it we have to give it
up, and we would rather do so than have any words about it.

15,713. Was this not a good year in the Faroe fishing?-No, very
indifferent.

15,714. What was the amount of a share in one of your smacks
with an average take this year?-I should say about £18.

15,715. Was that sum larger than the ordinary, or would some of
them be less or more?-We had some of them as high as £28 for a
sharesman.

15,716. Were these in the larger smacks?-No; there were others
as large, but less fortunate; and there were some of them much
smaller, and they could not be expected to do so well.

15,717. Do the men ever ask for or get a sight of the bills of
sale?-Yes.  I have shown them to the fishermen this year.

15,718. Had you ever shown them to them before?-Yes.  I
had not shown them to every man, but I had shown them to the
captain, who I expected would have more knowledge of the matter
than the other men.

15,719. Do the men generally run accounts at your shop?-Yes;
every one of them has an account.

15,720. Do you think they get most of the supplies for their
families during the season from your shop?-I think they do.
Perhaps there are two or three of them who want to look after
their means better than the rest, and who have money lying beside
them: these men may perhaps buy goods with cash, and not from
our shop; but, as a rule, every one of them gets his supplies from
us.

15,721. I believe the majority of your men are not in debt to you at
settlement, but have a balance to receive in cash?-Yes.  I think
there are very few this year, and there were very few last year, who
were in debt; and even with these men the amount of debt is very
small.

15,722. Do you think the amount of debt was smaller than usual in
the two years for which you have given [Page 396] returns, 1867
and 1871, or was it about an average?-That depends altogether
upon the fishing.  If it is not a total failure, the men are generally
all clear of debt; but if a bad year comes in, then we cannot expect
that.

15,723. How do you account for the fact that the men almost all
take their supplies for the season from your shop in an account
with you?-If they have no money, it is not likely that other people
will give them supplies, unless they know them very well; and
even if they have money, I always find that the men prefer to keep
it and come to the shop again and take up goods.

15,724. Do they keep the money in their hands rather than pay
for the goods in cash when they get them?-Yes, invariably.  I
have frequently noticed that practice among the men, and I have
spoken to them about it.  I have paid as much as £20 to a man at
settlement, and then he would come into the shop and take out his
outfit.  I have asked them why they did so, and told them it would
be better for them to pay for their goods with their own money,
and then they would know what they were doing.

15,725. What was their answer to that?-They said they preferred
to keep the money.  It was always in their hand, and the goods
could stand over for a year; and perhaps, if the next year's fishing
is bad, they think we will allow it to stand for two years rather than
push them for the price.

15,726. Would the men not get their goods cheaper if a system
existed of paying in cash?-I don't think they would.

15,727. They might not get them cheaper as matters stand at
present; but if they were, all willing to pay in cash, would it not be
possible for you to give them their goods cheaper than you supply
them upon credit?-I would not sell cheaper for cash.  The goods
are all marked in figures, and when they are paid for in cash they
are charged at the same prices as when put down to the account.
We have not two prices for our goods.

15,728. What proportion does your cash trade bear to your credit
trade?-I should say that it is more than one third, but not one
half.

15,729. In the answers you have given, are you speaking of the
Faroe fishermen in your employment, or are you also referring
to the home fishermen?-I have been speaking of the Faroe
fishermen principally.

15,730. Where are the men employed by you in the ling fishing?-
Most of them are situated in Sandwick parish.

15,731. Have they also accounts in your shop here?-Most of
them have.

15,732. But not to the same extent per man as the Faroe men?-
No; but we know exactly how much they are likely to gain, and
therefore they are not allowed to exceed a certain sum.

15,733. Do you limit the credits of the men employed in the home
fishing?-They limit their credits themselves, because they are
grown-up men with families, and they know how far they should
run their accounts.  Of course, if they were running them further,
we would limit them; but we rarely have to do that, because we
know they must have the little which they do get.

15,734. Is not that the case with the Faroe fishermen also?-Yes;
we limit them too.

15,735. But I understand you to say that the necessity for limiting
the home fishermen is greater than in the case of the Faroe
fishermen?-Yes.

15,736. Why is that?-Because I consider the home fishing is not
so good a fishing: the earnings from it are not so great.

15,737. You said you knew quite well what the men are likely to
earn in the ling fishing?-Yes.  I can tell from my experience the
outside which any ling fisherman can earn.

15,738. Do you know that before the season begins?-Yes.  By
taking five or six years together, I can see what a man has done in
time past, and I don't expect that he will exceed it.

15,739. Do you think that any five years of a fisherman's life will
give an average from which you can calculate his probable take for
next year?-Yes; I think five years is quite sufficient.

15,740. The variation, I suppose, arises from the nature of the
season?-Yes; in stormy weather they cannot go to sea so often
as in good seasons, and in other times the fish do not come over
the ground so well as they did before.  Another thing is the herring
fishing, which is connected with the ling fishing, the same boats
being used for both purposes.

15,741. Are you engaged in it extensively?-No, not very
extensively.  I think we have about 10 or 11 boats altogether
which fish in the herring fishery.

15,742. Is the engagement of the fishermen in the herring fishing
similar to that which exists in the ling fishing?-It is exactly the
same.

15,743. They are paid according to the current price at the end of
the season, and that price is settled for at the same time as the
price for the ling fishing?-Yes; they are both settled for together.

15,744. Do the returns which you have furnished with regard to
the home fishing include in any of the answers the earnings from
the herring fishing?-Yes; they apply to both ling and herring put
together.  In fact they apply to everything that the man has earned
in the years to which the questions relate.

15,745. Do you think it would be practicable to introduce a cash
system into Shetland in place of the annual settlements which now
exist?-It would be better for the curer.  I don't know if it would
be better for the fishermen altogether.  I think it would be better
for perhaps one half or two thirds of them; but the other third, I am
afraid, could not get on at all with the cash system.

15,746. Do you think they would have a difficulty in living over
the first half of the year?-Yes; over winter or spring, until the
fishing had commenced.

15,747. Do you think it would be impossible for them to get
advances during that time in order to keep them going?-If they
were to be paid in cash, the fish-curer of course would not give
them anything until they brought the fish to him, and other people
would be inclined to say the same thing.  The man would merely
have to be trusted like any other man going into any shop and
purchasing goods on his own credit.

15,748. But, except for that difficulty, you would prefer a cash
system?-I would.

15,749. Do you think there would be any difficulty in carrying out
that system, supposing it were once begun, the men had tided over
that transition period?-I think there would be none whatever.

15,750. Would it be possible to pay the men fortnightly or
monthly, or at delivery?-I would pay them weekly.

15,751. Would you pay them the whole proceeds of the fish caught
during the week?-I would pay them exactly for every tail they
landed.  I would fix a price with them at first, before they began to
the fishing at all; but that price might be altered weekly, according
the markets went up or down, the same as in any other trade.

15,752. Do you think the fishermen would agree to that?-We
have asked them to agree to it, but they have not done so.

15,753. Was that because they did not like to have the price fixed
and thus lose the chance of a rising market?-It was not so much
the fixing of the price that they objected to.  They would have
agreed to that, but some of them who did not know where to find
means said, 'What are we to do if we get no cash for a week or
two in stormy weather, and we cannot go off; the merchant cannot
supply us then.'  Of course they could not expect us to supply them
with anything after we had commenced with that system.

15,754. If the man was bound to fish for you, would you not be
willing to give him supplies?-But they would not be bound to
fish at all in that case.

15,755. But the men might be bound to fish for you all the season,
although they were paid weekly?-I would not care to engage
anybody then for the season.  I would have a station at a certain
place, [Page 397] with weights there, and I would pay for the fish
as I got them.

15,756. Was that the nature of the offer which you made to the
fishermen, and which they would not accept?-Yes.  We would
have no hold over the fishermen in that case at all.

15,757. Would it not be quite practicable to engage the men for
the whole season and to pay them weekly?-It would be quite
practicable.

15,758. Have you made an offer to them of that description?-
Yes; we have made an offer to some fishermen who fish for us
now.

15,759. Did you offer to engage them to fish for you for the whole
season?-Yes.  If they commenced, they would never think of
changing.

15,760. In that case would there be any reluctance on the part of
the fish-curer to make an advance to the men in a bad week if they
were bound to fish for him over the whole season?-I should not
care to do it because they might get no more fish after a certain
date.  At the end of the year the weather is very often such that the
men cannot go off for weeks, and we might be advancing on the
prospect of what never came, and then the men would be in debt.

15,761. In the case you refer to, were the fishermen not willing to
accept your offer?-They were not willing.

15,762. Do you think it would have made any difference in that
respect if the offer had been to pay a proportion of the price-say
a minimum price of 5s. 6d. or so for ling-and that the balance
should be paid according to the current price at the end of the
season?-I don't know how that would do.  I never spoke about
that with the men.  I think that would be giving them two chances.
It would be giving them the cash, and then giving them the full
value of the market after I had paid out my cash so much sooner
than I would otherwise have done.  When a thing is sold, it is sold,
and you take your chance either to lose or to gain, but in that case
the fishermen would have the cash in their hands, and they would
also have the chance of benefiting by a rise in the price.

15,763. But in other trades, merchants have to lay out their cash in
wages and take their chance of a return?-Yes; and I would do the
same.

15,764. You would do the same if the men were paid wages, but
would you not be prepared to make part of the wages dependent
upon the market price of the fish?-No.  I hold that in a business
transaction, if a party agrees to sell, and you agree to purchase, the
one takes his chance, and you take your chance too.  That would
bring each party to an understanding of how matters stood between
them.  If it was the practice altogether to purchase the fish green,
and to pay for them in money, there would be so many people in
competition for them that the men would be sure to get the full
value, because, if I gave 6d. more, another man would be sure to
give 6d. more if he could afford it, and the men would not lose
by that.  The fish would go up to the very top price, and the men
would reap the advantage.

15,765. Do you think there would be always two or three
competing merchants at each station?-Certainly there would.
The stations are only half a mile apart; and if one man would
not offer the price, another would do so.

15,766. Are your curers paid by weekly wages?-We have one
curer paid by weekly wages.

15,767. Do you cure by contract?-Yes, as well as by wage.

15,768. How many people are employed in your curing
establishment during the season?-I cannot say, because some
go on for a week or two, and others go on at the end of that
time; but we will have as high as forty and as low as twenty
people who are not off work.

15,769. How are these people paid?-They are paid weekly by a
daily wage on Saturday night.

15,770. Do they receive payment of their whole wages in cash?-
Every penny.

15,771. Are they paid in cash even if they have had out-takes
during the week?-They have no out-takes; we don't give them.

15,772. Is yours the only establishment in Shetland, so far as you
know, where that is the practice?-So far as I know, I believe it is;
but I am not certain.  The only other one where I thought it was
done was Leask's; but I happened to be present last day when Mr.
Robertson was examined, and I heard him say that they did give
credit, which I did not know before.

15,773. Has it been long the practice in your establishment not to
give credit to your weekly workers?-It has been the practice for
about five years.

15,774. Have you found it to facilitate your transactions very
much?-Yes; and it was for that reason we gave up the practice
of giving credit.  When we first commenced to cure at Bressay,
we paid by weekly wages; but the people usually wanted some
advances before the Saturday night, and we found in a short time
that we were losing money by bad debts while a great deal of time
was involved in settling with them on the Saturdays.  In fact it took
up so much time, and caused so much trouble, that we stopped it
altogether.

15,775. How did the bad debts occur?-The girls wanted to take
up clothing, and on Saturday night they required food for another
week, and we found they took up too much.

15,776. Have you found that the people are now contented
with the system which you have introduced?-They are quite
contented.

15,777. They don't come to you wanting out-takes?-Never.

15,778. Do you find they get on quite comfortably under the
present system?-Yes.  What took us hours before to settle,
we can settle now in the course of half an hour.

15,779. Don't you think the fishermen might manage to get on
under the cash system if it were introduced in the same way that
you have done with your workers in the curing establishment?-
The fishermen are different thing.  The fish have first to be caught
before they are paid for; whereas, in the other case, the people are
engaged for a weekly wage, which they are certain to get.


Lerwick, January 30, 1872, CHARLOTTE JOHNSTON, examined.

15,780. You live at Colafirth, near Ollaberry?-Yes.

15,781. How long have you lived there?-I was born at Colafirth,
but I came to Lerwick when I was 25 years of age, and I was here
for 17 years.

15,782. What did you do in Lerwick?-We kept a few boarders
and lodgers.

15,783. What do you do now in Colafirth?-I have been employed
scouring or dressing hosiery for the most part, and I generally
had to go to one man with it for 10 years, except two months.  I
commenced on 1st. June 1861, and stopped on 8th April 1871.

15,784. Who did you dress hosiery for?-Chiefly for Mr. Morgan
Laurenson, Lochend.

15,785. Do you also knit?-Yes.

15,786. Were you always paid for that in goods?-Yes.

15,787. Did you get them at Mr. Laurenson's shop at Lochend?-
Yes.

15,788. Do you also deal sometimes at the shop at Ollaberry?-
Yes.

15,789. Have you an account there?-Yes.  I have had a good
many accounts.  I think the first account I had with Mr. Laurenson
was in 1863.

15,790. Were these accounts settled regularly?-No; that was the
mistake.  I wanted to settle regularly after a few months, when I
got home perhaps from 10 to 20 dozen, but he ran on the accounts
for perhaps 14 or 15 months, so that I did not know whether I was
going ahead or going back.

15,791. This account [showing] was settled on [Page 398]
December 31, 1864: 'By contra., £7, 10s. 9d.'  What was that
due you for?-I had scouring, and I had two tatted rugs, and I
knitted cloth.

15,792. I see the account is settled again on March 31, 1866: were
you still working at the same things?-Yes.

15,793. The work you did was put at the end of the book?-Yes.

15,794. The book you have shown me is a very carefully kept
pass-book, is it not?  Is there anything wrong in it?-I was not
satisfied, and therefore I kept it.

15,795. Why were you not satisfied with it?-I thought he charged
me too much for my groceries, and gave too little for my dozens of
scouring.

15,796. Could you not have fixed your price for your scouring
yourself?-No, I did not get the chance.  He did it all himself,
because he had both sides of the question.

15,797. But you had no need to work for a less wage than you
thought was fair.  Could you not have gone somewhere else with
your work?-He always thought I should work to him.  I could
have gone to many a place else, and got work and been paid for it
what I thought was a fair price, but he thought I should still have to
stay and work for him.

15,798. Why did he think so?-I suppose he thought he got as well
done to by me as he could have got done to him by another.

15,799. But he could not oblige you to do anything you did not
choose to do?-When I would refuse to do what he wanted me to
do at a time when I was up myself, he would send the things to me
in a box to be done.

15,800. But you did not need to dress the goods unless you got
what you thought was a fair price for them?-I had to do it,
because I had to work for my own maintenance.

15,801. Are the pass-books you have produced the only pass books
you have?-Yes.

15,802. The next one is for 1868 and 1869.  Is with Mr. Laurenson
too?-Yes.

15,803. It is only brought down to October 1869.  Have you had no
pass-book since then?-No; I wanted to stop work then because I
was not well.

15,804. Have you got no supplies from Mr. Laurenson since
1869?-Yes; I have got an account of them. [Produces account.]

15,805. When was the account settled last?-I think it was in April
or May 1871; perhaps it may have been in June.

15,806. On May 16, 1870, I see you are charged 8d. for oatmeal:
how much was that for?-4 lbs.

15,807. Were you told at the time you got it what the price of it
was to be?-No; I did not know at the time how much it was to be.

15,808. On June 27 you are charged 2s. for tea: how much was
that?-Half a pound.

15,809. Do you buy 4s. tea at Lochend?-We have bought 5s. tea
at Lochend, but that was in 1863.

15,810. Is it very fine tea that you get at 2s. per 1/2 lb.?-We ask
for
the best that is in the shop.

15,811. Are you quite content with the quality of it?-We must
just take it as it is, because we have no means of going anywhere
else.  I have a sample of it here.  [Produces sample of tea.]

15,812. Is that 4s. tea?-No, it is 4s. 4d. tea.	That [producing line]
is the line they gave us for the goods we got on the 22d of this
month.	[Witness produces line in the following form

15,813. Where do you say you got these goods?-At Lochend,
from Mr. Laurenson.

15,814. You took him 2s. worth of hosiery?-Yes.

15,815. How much tea did you get for 1s. 1d?-A 1/4 lb.

15,816. How much rice did you get for 31/2 d?-1 lb.

15,817. How much sugar did you get for 21/2 d?-1/4 lb.

15,818. Did you pay him 21/2d. for it?-Yes

15,819. Was that loaf sugar?-Yes; I have a sample of it.

15,820. How much soap did you get?-The soap was 6d. per lb.
[The witness here produced a sample of the tea for which she had
paid 1s. 1d. per 1/4 lb.; a sample of the loaf sugar for which she had
paid 21/2d. per 1/4 lb.; a sample of the rice for which she had paid
31/2d. per lb.; a sample of the soap for which she had paid 6d. per
lb.; and a sample of flour for which she paid 2d. per lb.  These
were all docketed by the clerk as having been produced by
witness, and purchased from Mr. Laurenson's shop at Lochend.]

15,821. Did Mr. Laurenson know that you were to bring these
goods here?-No.

15,822. Did you get them for your own use?-Yes.

15,823. Were you asked by your summons to bring them here?-
Yes.

15,824. Are the articles which you get at the shop at Ollaberry of
the same quality as you get at Lochend?-Mr. Irvine, who keeps
the shop there, is very kind to me.  If I want all cash at any time,
he gives it; and Mr. George Henry and Mr. William Smith have
also been very kind to me.  They would give me cash at any time
on my hosiery if I asked for it.

15,825. Are you quite sure that the samples you have produced
were got at the same price that is charged for similar goods in your
account by Mr. Laurenson?-The prices in the account are those
which are charged when the goods are given for work, but the
samples I have produced were given in exchange for hosiery.

15,826. Are there two prices for goods at that shop?-Yes, they
always charged two prices.  When we pay for goods in hosiery,
they are always above the price which is charged when cash is
paid for them.

15,827. Do you get the goods cheaper when you pay for them by
your work, such as you are dressing, than when you are selling
hosiery?-Yes.  The price is then perhaps 1d. less for the 1/4 lb. of
tea.

15,828. How do you know that?-Because I see it marked.

15,829. Was the tea for which you were charged 4s. 4d., when
you paid for it by hosiery, the same tea that is charged 4s. in the
account?-I think so.

15,830. Are you not sure of it?-I did not see them take it out of
the chest.  I asked them for the same tea, but I don't know if they
gave the same kind.

15,831. But did you ask for the best tea in the shop in both
cases?-Yes, I always do.

15,832. Then all you know is that you asked for the best tea in the
shop, and it was charged 4s. 4d. when you gave hosiery for it,
and it was charged 4s. when it was put into your account for
dressing?-That is all I know; but it is a very short time since it
was 4s. 4d.  It was always 4s. 8d. before.

15,833. I see that on September 29, 1870, you are charged 1s. 6d.
for oatmeal: was that a peck?-Yes.

15,834. Were you paying 1s. 6d. for the peck of oatmeal at that
time?-Yes; and I suppose there were others paying it as well as
me.

15,835. Would you have paid the same for it in any other shop in
the neighbourhood?-No.  It was dearer [Page 399] than if I had
had the cash and gone into another shop to get it.

15,836. What did you say when you went to Mr. Laurenson with
the hosiery which you sold to him on the 22d?-It was my sister
who went, not me.

15,837. Did she tell you what she said?-I don't think it.

15,838. Are you quite sure your sister did not say what the goods
were wanted for?-I told her what goods to ask for, and she got
what I told her to get.

15,839. Did you tell her what you were to do with them?-No; I
had not got the summons then.

15,840. Would you have got these goods from Mr. Laurenson even
although you had not got the summons?-Yes.

15,841. Did you want them for your own use?-Yes.  I got them
on the Monday, and I did not get the summons until the Tuesday
night.

15,842. You have not brought the whole of the goods which you
bought then.  You have merely brought samples from what you
bought?-Yes.  I was only told in the summons to bring samples.

15,843. Was the note which you have produced, given in the shop
at the time when the goods were bought?-Yes.  The shop lad
marked down the things on that slip of paper and gave it to my
sister, so that she might show me what she had got, and what the
prices were.

15,844. You have handed me a letter from one Laurence Clark,
dated 25th January 1872, in which he says, 'I have to inform you
that I built Miss Charlotte Johnston a house in 1863, and I could
not get 1s. from her, because she wrought all her work to Mr.
Laurenson, at dressing hosiery, and could not get so much cash as
1s.  Therefore I had to take anything that she had to give me, that
could do me any good.  That kind of payment is not so good as
cash.'-For what purpose was this letter written?-It is merely a
line from the man who built my house, to show that I could not get
cash with which to pay him.

15,845. What did you pay Clark with for building your house?-I
got meal, tea, tobacco, sugar, and anything that was in the shop at
the times which he required; but I had to reduce the goods to him
to cash price, because he would have required his money of me,
and I did not have it to give him.

15,846. What was the price charged for building your house
altogether?-He charged 15d. a day and his food; I think it
came to about £2.

15,847. Did you give him a great deal more in goods, according to
the price which was charged to you for them?-Yes.   I gave him
six yards of cloth for jacket, and other things.

15,848. I see there is a lot of tobacco entered in your book about
1863?-Yes; that was for the men who were working at the house.

15,849. When was the house finished?-It is about eight years in
October since it was done.

15,850. I see there is some tobacco in December 1864.  Was your
house finished before then?-No.  It was finished outside, but not
inside.  We went into it in October, but the windows were not in,
and it was two years before I was able to get the flooring put in
one of the ends of it.

15,851. Did you give him a little tobacco every now and then until
it was finished?-Yes; but he got other things besides tobacco.

15,852. Does that account for the entries of tobacco in August and
September 1865 in your book?-Clark was paid by that time, but I
had to get my house thatched.

15,853. Was it not to pay him that you got that tobacco?-It was
either to pay him or some one else who was working for me.  I did
not have any money; and when any one did any job for me, I had
to pay them in some way or other.

15,854. What did you give them besides tobacco?-I sometimes
had a few dishes that they required, and they took them or tea.

15,855. Does that account for there being so many entries of tea in
your book?-Yes.  I got wool and potatoes for tea.

15,856. At the settlement in July last there was a balance due by
you to Mr. Laurenson?-Yes.

15,857. Have you not been working to him since?-I was not able
to work.

15,858. About a month ago you got a notice from him that you
would be summoned to court unless you paid the balance of your
debt, 14s. 31/2d?-Yes; but I did not expect that I should have had
anything to pay.

15,859. Did you think the balance was in your favour?-Yes, I
expected that.

15,860. But you were running up an account, and you did not
know?-Yes, but that was not my blame.  I always wanted a
settlement; and if he had paid me for my work and my goods, I
would not have been due him anything.

15,861. When did you leave home?-I left home on Thursday, and
came by the steamboat.  I did not go on board of her at Ollaberry
until Saturday night, but I had left home two days before, and had
to wait for her.

15,862. How old are you?-I was fifty-two in July.

15,863. You are not in good health, and you are not able to walk
a long distance?-No.  I cannot walk far on account of the
rheumatics.

15,864. Have you any idea when you will get home?-No.

15,865. Do you intend to go back by the steamboat if you can?-If
the steamboat goes I will go with her but if not, I will have to stay
until the packet comes back from Northmaven.

<Mr Guthrie>.-I have to give notice that I do not think at present
that I shall summon any more witnesses to appear in Shetland; but
there will be a meeting at half-past nine o'clock, and if any one
wishes to make any statement, or to bring forward any additional
evidence, he will then have an opportunity of doing so.

<Adjourned>.


LERWICK: WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 31, 1872.

JOHN GATHERER, examined,

15,866. You have been for a long time Collector of Customs at
Lerwick?-I have.  Before questioning me, I would like if you
would allow me to make a brief preliminary remark or two which
may render clear any after-evidence which you may call upon me
to give.  At the time when certain gentlemen tendered their
evidence on Shetland truck before the Commission at Edinburgh, I
read the brief, necessarily imperfect, and probably inaccurate
reports of the same which appeared in the Edinburgh weekly
papers.  I also read some articles and letters which appeared in the
newspapers at the time.  About seven months ago I read, as printed
I think in a Parliamentary blue book, the report of Mr Hamilton to
the Board of Trade about the discharge of the Shetland whaling
seamen at this port.  I have never read the report since.  On my
return from the, mainland last summer, I found a gentleman had
left in my house a copy of the evidence, as [Page 400] printed <in
extenso> in a pamphlet form.  I think the pamphlet contained a
report of Mr. Arthur Hay's adverse evidence; but I had not time to
read it before I posted the pamphlet to a friend in the south.  I
therefore never read his evidence.  Beyond a brief newspaper
paragraph, which I read recently, I literally know nothing as to
the evidence which has been given under the present inquiry.  I
purposely kept aloof from the same, and from inquiring about
the same.  I appear here very reluctantly on the present occasion,
and, as you are aware, I would not have appeared at all had I not
been cited.  I have several reasons for this reluctance to appear: I
will mention two of them.  I entertain very strong opinions
condemnatory of the truck system, which I believe prevails all
over Shetland; but I do not wish personally to have anything to do
with the matter, directly or indirectly.  I think it is to be regretted
that the question as to the mode of paying the whaling seamen
should have been introduced at in the Edinburgh evidence, and
complicated by being mixed up with the general question of truck.
Both questions, I think, should have been treated separately, as
they are the subject of distinct laws and regulations, these laws
at the same time being administered by distinct departments.
From what I have already stated, you will see that I have a very
imperfect recollection of the statements in Mr. Hamilton's report,
but I recollect my impression of it at the time when I read it.  It
was, that the statements in the report were essentially correct
representations of what had taken place at one time or other at
Lerwick.  I have heard that some one has questioned the accuracy
of some portions of his report.  It might be liable to misconception
in this respect.  When he inspected my office, we talked generally
over the objectionable system that had so long prevailed here in
the mode of discharging and paying off the men.  A great deal of
this must have been patent and notorious to Mr. Hamilton, as a
former resident in Shetland, and having subsequent intercourse
with the same; and he may not possibly, in his narrative of this to
the Board of Trade, have clearly separated some of the past and
the suppressed practices of the agents, and those of more recent
date.  This would the more readily occur, as I have reason to
believe that at the time he prepared his report he was not aware
that I had over a number of years repeatedly and fully reported the
whole matter to the Board of Trade.  I have here with me a report
relative to the discharge of whaling crews during the last year, and
some returns relative to the same, and for previous years, which I
hurriedly prepared with the view of sending to the Board of Trade
by the mail, which I expected would have sailed yesterday.  When
preparing the same, I was not expecting I would have to give
evidence on the subject.  I do not wish to hand in the documents,
but I may have occasion to refer to them.

15,867. You showed me these returns last night, and allowed me
to see the report which you were sending to the Board of Trade?-
I did.

15,868. You are satisfied, I presume, as to the substantial
correctness of these returns?-Yes, of my own report and the
returns.  There is a difficulty in preparing them, from the time
that has elapsed; but, as you are aware, I have asked them to
verify the accuracy of them at the proper quarter.

15,869. Subject to that verification, you believe these returns to be
correct?-Yes.  They were prepared by myself and those in any
office from the records.

15,870. Therefore, if any application should be made to the Board
of Trade afterwards for production of these returns under this
Commission, you have no objection to their being regarded as part
of your evidence given upon oath?-None; and in continuation of
the report, I will refer to the fact that I have been examined before
you.

15,871. You are aware that before 1867 the wages of seamen
returning from Greenland voyages and landed in Shetland were
never paid at the Custom House?-In some cases they were, but
very seldom.

15,872. Do you also know from your own observation, and from
what you heard at the time, that those seamen were generally
running large accounts with the agents, by whom they were
secured for these sealing and whaling voyages?-I was aware of
that from the statements of the seamen, themselves.

15,873. In numerous cases?-Yes, in numerous cases.

15,874. In almost every case?-I believe so.

15,875. In what way did these statements come to be made to
you?-The seamen often came and complained to me that they
were not paid off.  It may perhaps be proper to explain that at that
time, before the special Board of Trade regulations were issued,
the masters should have come and paid off the seamen.  I may add
further, that I am aware that every means was taken by the agents
to keep the masters of the Peterhead and Dundee vessels from
coming and discharging their men in cases where it would have
been attended with no inconvenience.

15,876. In what way did you become aware of that?-I got
numbers of letters from the masters stating that they were unable
to attend themselves with the men.  These letters, so sent to me,
were often written by the agents, but signed by the masters.

15,877. Did you know them to be in the handwriting of the
agents?-Yes, or of their clerks; and on inquiring at the captains
when they came back to engage men again, some of them told me
that the agents desired them to do so.

15,878. Not to pay the men?-Yes, not to pay the men.  In these
letters they stated that they often wished the men to appear, but
that they (the men) ran away home; which statement the men
subsequently told was incorrect.

15,879. At that time, was the payment of these Greenland seamen
at Lerwick subject to the same general regulations which were in
force in other parts of the empire?-Yes.  There were instructions
to shipping masters at that time.

15,880. Were these the same regulations that are still in force in
other parts of the kingdom?-Yes.

15,881. They are still in force everywhere, except in Lerwick?-
Yes.  They are still in force, except in the case of Shetland,
Orkney, and the port of Stornoway.  I may mention that the
procuring of seamen, by agents was at that time, and is still in
other places, illegal and punishable by fine-that is, according to
the Merchant Shipping Act of 1854.  I believe the mode in which
they then acted would in the south be treated as crimping; and
allow me to say also, that the offence was rendered greater by the
fact of the agents being merchants and supplying the men with
goods.

15,882. I believe there is a prohibition of that?-Yes; and even
licensed agents-that is, individuals licensed by the Board of
Trade-are not allowed to be so if they have dealings with the
men.  That also is under the Act of 1854.

15,883. The regulation at the time you speak of, although it
was not observed, was, that the men should be paid before the
superintendent?-Yes, then called the shipping master.

15,884. That officer in this case was yourself, as there is no local
marine board here?-Yes.

15,885. Why was the regulation not observed?-I am satisfied it
was from the agents desiring to secure the profits on the supplies
of the men.

15,886. Had you made frequent endeavours to enforce compliance
with the Act?-Yes.

15,887. You reported repeatedly to the Board of Trade on the
subject?-Yes.  I may mention that, when I came here first, there
was an attempt on the part of some of the agents to introduce their
accounts into the men's accounts of wages, which I checked, and
which I believe then led to the shipmasters not appearing.

15,888. That was many years ago?-It is a good many years ago.
In some cases these accounts were introduced under the name of
ship's accounts.

15,889. Was not that done as late as 1867, after the regulations had
been modified?  At least I was told that in some cases the agents
had introduced their own accounts among the captain's stores in
the ship's store-[Page 401]book?-I suspect that was done to a
trifling extent, although I should not like to say decidedly that it
was done.

15,890. Was there not a clause introduced in 1868 by which
that was distinctly prohibited?-There were some defects in the
regulations, and they were altered in order to meet the attempts
made to evade them.

15,891. Since 1867 has the system been materially changed by
the regulations then introduced by the Board of Trade?-Yes,
materially.

15,892. The seamen now receive their full payment in cash in your
presence?-They do.

15,893. Although not at the time required by the Act?-There is
great delay in many cases.

15,894. That is said by several witnesses who have appeared here,
to be due to the reluctance of the men to come forward, and their
desire to go home and see their friends as soon as they are landed:
is that so?-To a great extent, I do not believe that.

15,895. Have you any reasonable doubt that if the men were
instructed by the master of the ship and the agents to go at once
to the Custom House for payment of their wages, they would obey
that direction?-I believe from my knowledge of the men, that if
the master and the agent decidedly told them to go to the Custom
House after being landed, they would go.  There is no doubt that
men after a long voyage are naturally anxious to get home; but if
they knew they had to be paid then, they would readily accede to
the request of the master and the agent.

15,896. Is there any reason you can assign, from your acquaintance
with the practice in paying seamen's wages, why the accounts
should not be all ready within the time allowed by the law?-My
whole experience in the matter points to the fact that the agents are
unwilling to have a speedy settlement, and that unless compelled
they would never appear at the Custom House at all, or rather I
should say at the Mercantile Marine Office.

15,897. Have you had occasion since 1868 to know that the
seamen are still incurring large accounts, or considerable accounts,
to the agents by whom they are secured?-I have endeavoured not
to be cognisant of any of their dealings; but I may add further, that
I believe, although the special regulations are outwardly and
nominally complied with the agents still secure their accounts
from the men for their supplies.

15,898. You think there is still a security-a sort of virtual
impledgment of the men's wages although they are nominally
paid over in cash?-Yes.  It may not be by agreement, but the
thing practically exists; and I never heard the agents conceal the
fact that the profit on the seamen's wages is the main inducement
to them in accepting the agency.  That very fact, in my opinion,
renders the whole transaction irregular and illegal.  Of course, that
is a matter of opinion.

15,899. Have you had occasion to interfere while seamen were
settling wages with the clerk of the agent, in order to prevent
part of the money being retained for the payment of the agent's
account?-I may mention that the men, after being settled with at
the Custom House generally run down to the agent's office.  I
know that, because I hear the men speaking about it, and the
agents, or rather the agents' clerks, telling them to go down to
the place.

15,900. Have you frequently heard the men told to go down?-
Yes.  The men sometimes blurt it out, and the agents' clerks are
not very much satisfied at their doing so; but the whole thing is so
well understood, that there is little concealment about it.

15,901. You have frequently heard conversations on the subject,
showing that the men were expected to go down at once?-Yes;
and some of the clerks had the audacity to attempt to deduct the
amount at the office not later than last year.

15,902. Who were these?  Are they mentioned in your report?-
They are mentioned in my report to the Board of Trade.

15,903. Do you know whether one consequence of the new
regulations has been, that the green hands engaged for the settling
and whaling voyages are much fewer now than they were before
1867?-I am not aware of the fact.  My attention has never been
called to it.

15,904. Are you prepared to say that there are not fewer green
hands engaged now than there were before 1867?-I cannot say
as to that.

15,905. Your observation has not led you to think so?-No.  The
idea never occurred to me.

15,906. Have you had occasion to know whether the seamen have
been told by the masters or the agents since 1868 to attend at the
Shipping Office within the time required by law?-The special
regulations, unfortunately, do not define any time within which
they are to attend, and I have no doubt the agents know that fact.

15,907. The three days do not apply under these regulations?-
That is a question that I should not like to give an opinion upon.

15,908. The clause about the three days is quoted in the last head
of the regulations?-It is quoted there to show what the general
law is.

15,909. But you have a doubt in your own mind as to whether it
applies here?-I may at once say that these special regulations
were a sort of compromise, and I am so far answerable for their
being framed, thinking that they would secure the men their
wages. My opinion now is, that it would have been better if the
Act had been enforced as it originally stood; and I believe the
thing will never be on a satisfactory footing as long as agents
who are merchants continue to act as agents.

15,910. Is it not a benefit for the young men who are engaged
for the Greenland fishery, to be able to get their outfit from the
merchants on credit, as they do?-I think the same thing could be
secured by other and legitimate means.

15,911. You know that the men get an advance note for the
amount of the first month's wages?-Yes; and after these
special regulations came into force, Laurenson & Co. were the
first who paid the men over the counter in cash.

15,912. You are speaking now of the advances?-Yes, of the
advance note.  Messrs. Hay latterly did the same; and Mr. Tait, I
think, did so this year for the first time.  I recollect asking Mr.
Laurenson if he sustained any loss by treating the men with
confidence and giving them the money, and to the best of my
recollection he said he did not.

15,913. But the outfit requires a larger sum than the advance
amounts to in any case?-Yes; but allotment notes would meet
that.  That would give the relatives of the seamen an opportunity
of drawing the money in their absence.

15,914. Are these the only means by which you think a young man
without an outfit could provide himself with one?-I think any
merchant would give the seamen credit, if they were certain that
the present agents did not enjoy the monopoly of giving them their
supplies.  I may further state, that I believe a gentleman intends to
a certain extent to act its agent for some of the vessels this year, to
pay the men's advances in cash, and to allow their allotment notes
to be paid by a banker or some disinterested party.  If that system
were introduced, it would knock the whole irregularity on the
head.  Such is my individual opinion.

15,915. Do you think the gentlemen who now act as agents would
have any hesitation, or that any danger would arise to them, in
supplying goods to the men, if they were not acting as agents, but
merely as merchants?-I think they are not entitled to enjoy a
monopoly of the trade.

15,916. But supposing they were not acting its agents at all, but
merely as merchants, do you think they would hesitate, or that they
would incur any risk by advancing outfits to the men its they now
do, but without the security or the quasi security which they now
possess?-In that case the men's custom would be distributed over
all the town.  They would give their custom to the merchants they
were partial to, instead of being confined to the shop of the agent
who engages them, as at present.

[Page 402]

15,917. But would those who got their custom incur any serious
risk in giving them their supplies and outfits on credit?-They
would be liable to the same risk that every merchant who embarks
in trade is subject to.  No man can deal with another on credit
without being liable to a risk; but at present the merchants
practically enjoy a monopoly of the seamen's supplies.

15,918. The seamen, however, could go to any other shop in town
for their supplies if they chose?-At present they could, but I
have no doubt they would offend the agent by doing so.  If they
repudiated his right to secure his own account, that would put an
end to the thing, because the main inducement for the agents to act
as they do is that they have the supplying of the men with goods.

15,919. Have you anything else to say?-Nothing.


Lerwick, January 30, 1872, JOHN WALKER, recalled.

15,920. You formerly gave evidence before the Commissioners
under the Act of 1870, in Edinburgh?-I did.

15,921. Are there any points on which you wish to give further
information?-I merely wish to reaffirm all that I previously
stated.  From what the people say, the only thing that seems to
require explanation, is with regard to the value of the worsted or
wool for the making of a shawl.

15,922. You refer to question 44,290: 'I know for a fact that the
worsted of a shawl which sells at about 30s. is worth from 2s. to
3s.  They nominally give the worker 9s. for working it, but if they
get it in goods that will be about 4s.; and they get from 25s. to 30s.
for it?'-Yes.  The question was intended to apply to half square
shawls and haps selling at from £1 to 30s., according to the
verdancy of the animal that was buying it.  It takes about sixteen
hundreds to make a hap, and the worsted will be worth. from 2d.
to 21/2d.  It will take from sixteen to seventeen hundreds to make a
half square fine shawl, and the worsted of it will be worth about
4d.; and these shawls are sold at from 18s. to 30s., according as
customers can be got for them.

15,923. Are haps often sold at so high a price as 30s?-No, not
haps; they are sold up to about £1.  That has been my experience.
I may say that I have been in shops, when the first question asked
before a price was stated was, whether the article was for the
person's self or for a stranger; that is to say, was it to be sold to a
person in the country, or was it to go away outside, because in
these cases they have two different prices.  I have likewise been in
shops when, if there were any of the knitting girls there selling
shawls or other articles, the merchant would take very good care to
state the price to his other customers in the lowest possible voice,
and at the farthest possible distance from these girls; and I have
been repeatedly told that they will occasionally put the price upon
a piece of paper, so as not to let the knitters hear it.  That I say in
contradiction to the assertion which is made, that the merchants
sell the hosiery articles at the same price as that at which they
nominally buy them.  Again, I want to point out that in most cases
all the worsted that the hosiery merchants in Lerwick dealt in up to
the last year was bought from the country merchants for goods,
and therefore that even that nominal value did not represent the
true value of the articles.  I produce an account containing
transactions amounting to £146; it is all balanced by goods, which
were entirely worsted, up to £1, 3s. 10d.  The only item of cash I
find in the account is 15s.  Lately, however, they have been
obliged and are ready to buy the worsted for cash, because they
cannot do without it, and the supply of worsted is decreasing.

15,924. You are speaking of Shetland worsted?-Yes.  I may
mention also that that estimate of the value of the worsted for a
shawl was intended by me to embrace the Yorkshire worsted,
or what they call the Pyrenees, although I don't suppose either
the worsted or the wool ever saw the Pyrenees: it is made in
Yorkshire.

15,925. Are you speaking, in both these cases of haps and of
shawls, of articles made of Shetland worsted?-All the haps
are made from Shetland worsted, the coarser worsted.

15,926. You said in that answer to which you have referred, 'They
nominally give the worker 9s. for working it, but if they get it in
goods that will be about 4s.:' is not that a little too strong?-I
don't think it.

15,927. That assumes that the charge for the goods is about 100
per cent. above the cost price, or rather it assumes that it is 100
per cent. above the price at which the worker of the shawl ought
to get these goods, which would not be the cost price, but the
retail price?-No, I don't mean that.  I mean to say that if these
merchants were to go to the proper market, they could buy their
goods at such a rate that they would be able to sell them at 100 per
cent. profit; but I know that a great many of these merchants go to
second-hand houses to buy.  Whether it is for the object of getting
long credits, or what it is, I don't know; but I know from the
parties who come here that a great many of them are not first-class
houses.

15,928. Have you any personal knowledge as to the wholesale
houses with which these merchants deal for their goods?-Do
you mean, do I know who comes down here?

15,929. Yes?-Yes, I do.

15,930. From what source is your knowledge derived?-From
their travellers, and from seeing their goods coming down.

15,931. You are acquainted with the travellers of those houses?-
Most assuredly.

15,932. And you know that they are not wholesale houses in the
strict sense of the term, but middle-men?-Exactly.  I say that the
merchants here could go to much better quarters for their goods if
they were to put their business on a proper footing.  Wholesale
houses in Aberdeen are not in the same position as wholesale
houses in London.

15,933. Do London houses send travellers here?-No; but if the
merchants' business was on a proper foundation they could get
introductions to these houses, and do their business at a better rate.

15,934. Is there any other point on which you wish to make an
addition or explanation upon your former evidence?-It has
been generally remarked by fishcurers, that one reason why they
could not give up the present system of dealing with their men
was because the men would not have the means of getting boats
and fittings for the fishing, whilst at the same time the principal
fish-curers assert that they do pay enormous sums of money to the
men.  For instance, I have seen from the papers that it has been
stated by Messrs. Hay & Co. that in the island of Whalsay alone
they paid £1300 last year, whilst the total value of the boats and
fishing gear there cannot be over £400.  Therefore it is absurd to
say that the men would not be able to supply themselves with
boats.  Again, it has been stated and maintained that the Shetland
men as a race are intelligent, and in one sense they are.  Indeed
their intelligence is so acute that the employers are ashamed, as
I have no doubt you have found in the evidence, to give them
accounts.  They are rather afraid that their acuteness would
discover too much in them, but in addition to that they tell you it
would be impossible for the men to divide the produce of the
fishing among themselves if it was paid in cash at the station,
because it would require a man conversant with accounts; so that
it is an absurdity to say that they are an intelligent race, and yet
cannot adjust the proportions which would go to the different men
in a boat's crew if they were paid in cash.

15,935. Probably they would be sufficiently acute to adjust their
accounts if they were accustomed to do so like other people in
other parts of the world?-I say they are quite capable of doing
that.  They are quite capable of looking after their own accounts if
these were [Page 403] produced to them.  There is another thing I
should like to point out with regard to the agriculture of Shetland
as compared with that of other places.  I am sorry I have come
away without the statistics, but if you look into them you will find
that we have a much larger number of stock in Shetland with a
rental of only £30,000, than Orkney with a rental of £60,000, from
which I deduce that it is a far greater object to the merchants and
proprietors here to continue the people as fishers upon the present
system, than to put the land upon a legitimate and proper footing.

15,936. In what way do you arrive at that inference?-The land
is under-rented for the purpose of binding the men to continue
as fishermen for their employers.  A great deal of the land is in
outsets, and these outsets were originally set at the mere interest
upon the house that was built, or upon any enclosures that
were made.  That was done for the purpose of procuring extra
fishermen, and the system has been continued to this day.  By
looking at the valuation roll, you would find an immense
difference between the rents of merks land and the rents of outsets.

15,937. I don't suppose that any proprietor who employs his men
in fishing would deny that if he ceased to do so the rents of his
tenants must be raised?-I rather think they do deny that.

15,938. I have had admissions made to that effect in the evidence
which has been given before me?-I have heard none of the
evidence that has been taken; but I am glad to hear that they are
thinking of turning over a new leaf, and admitting even that they
are wrong.

15,939. I don't say it has been a general admission, but that
admission has been made by one proprietor at least?-I say that
it ought to be a general admission. Another thing I would mention
is, that the people with their present beliefs are unfortunately too
subservient to come forward and frankly give full evidence upon
the matter, and I would give an instance of the sub-serviency and
illiterateness that prevails among them.  I received the other day
a report from two men, in which they use such language as
'resources of science and art,' and one of them was styled the
superintendent, and the other the manager, of the working
department of the largest establishment in this place for the
manufacture of blubber.  One of these men could hardly sign
his own name, while the other had to sign with cross.  That fact I
mention in order to show that these men are under the belief that
they are bound to do in most cases as their superiors may dictate
to them.

15,940. Has it come within your knowledge that many people
have been afraid to come forward and give evidence before this
Commission?-Yes; a great many people have told me they would
not do it.

15,941. Do you refer to fishermen?-To fishermen and to females
too.  I may mention also that I have been instrumental in starting a
large company here upon the limited liability principle, the first
object of which is stated to be to afford to the people of Shetland
an opportunity of prosecuting their fishings free from the truck
system.

15,942. Is that a company for prosecuting the Faroe fishing or the
ling fishing?-It is to be for all.  It is to commence this year with
the Faroe fishing.

15,943. Did you send out any vessels in 1871?-No, we did
not begin in 1871, except with a single vessel in which I was
interested, and which we sent out to see what we could do with it.

15,944. Did that vessel belong to the company?-No, not to this
company.  The company has been formed in Glasgow, of
gentlemen who are desirous of putting down this iniquitous
system.

15,945. Do you propose to carry on the fishing with	out any
shop?-Yes.

15,946. And to pay all in cash?-Yes.

15,947. Do you propose to pay by annual settlements?-The men
still prefer going upon the old system of payments; but in order to
provide for their outfit, as they call it, we propose to pay it in cash
the moment the vessel leaves the harbour with them on board, and
we intend to afford to their families an advance of what is fair and
reasonable to keep them while the men are away.  We are quite
prepared to run all that risk against a bad fishing, and we will pay
them the balance in cash at any moment they choose after they
come home.

15,948. Are the advances you are to make to be in cash also?-
Yes; they are to be in cash, not in goods.

15,949. Do you think it will be possible for the fishing business
to be conducted, perhaps not immediately, but shortly after this,
without the fishermen requiring advances either in cash or
goods?-Certainly; and I say that if that system could be adopted
now it could be carried on, looking to the amount of money that
has been accumulated on deposit by the people in the country
generally.

15,950. Then why do you propose in your enterprise to make
advances in cash?-Just to suit the humour of the people, until
they come to see for themselves that such advances are not
necessary.

15,951. I suppose you want to begin cautiously?-We do, and
to work them into the system gradually.  In fact we wish them
eventually to take shares in these vessels, and to get vessels and
boats for themselves.

15,952. But in the arrangement you propose, so far as the Faroe
fishing is concerned, the men will be sharesmen?-They are
sharesmen in the produce, but they have no shares in the vessel;
but I propose that they should eventually have an interest in the
vessel, and we are quite willing to give them an interest in any
vessel they choose.  We are also desirous to get better boats for
them in the ling fishing.  It has been stated likewise that the people
could not get their supplies at the stations if there was a cash
system, as there would not be shops there, because the whole
amount that is sold at the stations in the course of a year is merely
nominal; and to show that, it is mentioned that it is usually an
ordinary splitter who attends to the shop, or the fish factor.  That
man is not in the shop any time during the rest of the year, and it is
said that there is only a very limited amount of goods sent there,
being intended only for the supply of the men when they go out to
sea.  If that is the case, it would be no great hardship if these goods
were not there, but I say that they would be there.

15,953. Do you think the men could easily take their own supplies
with them?-Quite easily; and wherever the carcase is, there will
the eagles be gathered.  If there is money to be got there, you will
be sure to find shops there too.

15,954. In what way were the men paid who went to the Faroe
fishing in your vessel last year?-They were paid by shares the
same as they had hitherto been, and this [producing it] is a copy of
their settlement.  The name of the vessel is the 'Lily of the Valley.'

15,955. I see that this account of the settlement is drawn up in the
form which is ordinarily used in Shetland?-I don't know, but I
suppose it is.

15,956. It shows the amount of fish caught, and then the
deductions, and finally the division?-Yes.

15,957. I see no deduction for commission?-There is no
commision.

15,958. That is usually, but not universally, taken by the owner?-
I don't know why it should be.  I think it is hardly fair if the men
are doing their duty that the owner should not do his also, and take
the fish to the best market.

15,959. You think the owner should be considered to be paid for
that by his share of the produce?-I think so.  I also produce a
copy of our account for the expense of salt and curing.

15,960. Does this show the actual expenditure incurred by you in
curing the fish brought in by the vessel?-Yes.

15,961. Was it arranged with the men that they should be charged
only the actual expense incurred for salt and curing, and not an
estimate according to the usual system?-Yes.

15,962. Is it not usual in Shetland that the expense of curing is
deducted according to an estimate of 47s. 6d. and 50s., or 52s. 6d.,
as the case may be?-No; I understand it is the cost that is
charged.  The agreement [Page 404] with our men was that they
were to receive one half of the proceeds of the fish caught, after
deducting the expenses of curing, salt, etc., and master's premium
10s. per ton, and mate's premium 2s. 6d. per ton, and that they
should receive 8 lbs. weight of bread per man per week, and also
9d. per score to each man for all the fish caught by him, one half to
be paid by the owners, and the other half by the crew.

15,963. What was the return to the owners upon their share of that
vessel last year?-22 per cent.

15,964. The total share payable to each man is shown in the
account you have produced?-Yes.  Their half share amounted to
£188, 9s. 6d., but then they had wages in the succeeding voyage as
specified in the agreement.

15,965. Is there any other point on which you wish to make any
additional remark?-I may say that when I was south lately, I saw
letters from some of the whaling agents here, which plainly
indicated that the commission of 21/2 per cent. paid to them for the
engagement of seamen for the seal and whale fishing, would not,
in their opinion, afford sufficient remuneration to them.

15,966. Have you got these letters?-No; but I saw them, and I
was asked by the owners in the south if I could put them in the
way of getting an agent who would consider himself sufficiently
remunerated by that commission.  I was first asked if I considered
21/2 per cent. paid them for their trouble.  I said certainly; and I
then engaged with Mr. Scott in Lerwick to act as agent for these
vessels.  Their previous agents did not consider that they would be
remunerated sufficiently unless they got a full opportunity of
trading with the men.

15,967. Is Mr. Scott to act as agent without having any opportunity
of trading with the men?-Yes.  The advance will be paid in cash
at the time of the engagement, and the allotment notes will be paid
at the bank.

15,968. Did you make that arrangement in consequence of what
the shipowners in the south said to you?-Yes.  That is an
experiment which Mr. Scott is about to make; but there is no
doubt about the result of it, because 21/2 per cent. is a very liberal
commission for doing little or nothing.

15,969. Are you now in the management of the chromate of iron
quarries in Unst?-Yes.

15,970. I understand the wages there are not paid in truck?-No;
they have not been since I had anything to do with the quarries.

15,971. Are you aware that that was the case formerly-Yes; it
was truck from beginning to end.

15,972. Did you find that to be the case when you undertook the
management of the quarries?-Yes; after I had commenced the
thing I was asked by the man who had previously trucked them if I
would allow the workmen to be settled with in the office, so that
they could get them into the shop immediately afterwards.

15,973. In what capacity had that person trucked them?  Was
he secretary or manager for the company?-They had a sort of
anomalies there for managing the company.  This one was
supposed to be paymaster, and then they had a manager.  The
paymaster was a director, and he had a shop too.

15,974. Did you ascertain that the men had been paid at that shop
by lines or tickets?-There was no payment at all.  Their accounts
were adjusted from time to time, the amount of goods which they
had got was taken off, and the balance was handed to them.  It was
done openly and above-board; the man himself told me about it.

15,975. But accounts are always kept and settled in Shetland
without any attempt of concealment?-I think so.  I never had any
difficulty in discovering it.  I may add further, from my experience
as chairman of three parochial boards, that since the system of
truck and paying with lines was done away with in the parishes I
am connected with, the rates have been reduced considerably.

15,976. How do you account for that?-Because the people have
got money.  It used to be considered an acknowledged fact, that for
a pauper's shilling, if they brought a shilling to the shop, they
would get 14d. worth of goods.  The money was able to go much
further, because there was wholesome competition between the
different merchants to get a share of the money.

15,977. I understand Major Cameron's tenants throughout
Shetland are at liberty to fish for any fish-curer they please?-
Yes, for any one they please.

15,978. I think in your previous evidence you referred to the lease
to Spence & Co. in Unst, and expressed a sort of regret that it had
ended in a monopoly?-Yes.

15,979. There has been a good deal of evidence given before me to
the effect that a monopoly of that kind is beneficial, and that it is
wholesome, mainly in preventing small shops from springing up in
large numbers, and that it requires a large capitalist to develop the
resources of the country properly: is that so?-That is perfectly
true: but a merchant or any one who says that should recollect that
except for the capital of the poor fishermen they could not carry on
the business themselves.

15,980. Are you aware whether the fish-merchants generally are
men of large capital?-I should say that they cannot be, from this
fact, that they would readily pay the men in cash which they get,
and which in the month of August must amount to about £40,000
due to the men, if they had it.

15,981. Is that merely an inference which you draw from the
practice which prevails?-Yes.

15,982. But have you any personal knowledge on the subject?-
Yes.   Perhaps it would not be fair to mention the names of the
firms, but I know several firms who have commenced within the
last few years with no capital, and who are carrying on a business
which in the south would require an enormous capital.  I know it is
alleged by merchants generally that they do not consider they are
trading upon the poor man's capital.

15,983. I suppose you speak of the merchants trading upon the
poor man's capital, in this sense, that they do not pay for the fish
which is in their hands until about the time when they get their
returns?-Exactly; that they neither are merchants nor agents.
They are not merchants, because they do not pay the men for the
raw material, and they are not agents, because they do not give
them honestly their account sales.

15,984. Are you aware of the practice existing in Shetland,
that the proprietors in many cases receive their rents from the
fish-curers?-Yes.  During the first year or two that I settled for
Major Cameron, I got many cheques from the fish-curers.

15,985. Was that for the whole amount of rent due by a number
of fishermen?-Yes, either that, or each man would bring his
separate cheque; but in a great many cases in Shetland the
fish-curer just pays it slump, or what is called guarantees it.

15,986. That is not an actual guarantee; it is merely an
arrangement by which the fisherman, for the convenience
of all parties, is debited in the fish-curer's book with the
amount of rent which the fish-curer pays to the landlord?-
True; but in it great many cases, as I have previously stated, I
think there is a chronic balance against the men, which balance,
I think, if looked into, would generally be found to be composed
to a great extent of advances of rent for the next year, which
practically thirls the men on to them, but which has no right to
go through their books at all.

15,987. Are you aware whether the fish-curer is induced to make
that advance of rent by the consideration that he holds his own
premises from the landlord, and might be charged a higher rent, or
lose some other advantage, if he did not do so?-Most assuredly.
There is no doubt that, if they were thrown open, the rents of the
business premises would double themselves throughout the
country.

15,988. Have you known any instance in which the landlord
favoured the merchant so far as to refuse to allow other businesses
to be begun upon his estates?-Yes.

15,989. Had that happened in the case of Major Cameron's
estates?-Not so far as I know, and no one [Page 405] has ever
asked it.  In fact we have business premises lying unlet just now.

15,990. Do you know that that has happened elsewhere?-I do; in
more cases than one.

15,991. Is it not virtually the case in Unst, that no premises are
allowed there except those of Spence Co.?-I don't know about
that, because Spence & Co.'s principal premises are upon
Henderson's property.

15,992. Were you not aware of Spence & Co. removing a
merchant who had premises on the property of Major Cameron,
which was under tack to them?-No; I think that was on a
neighbouring property.

15,993. Was that the case of a house that was shifted bodily across
the road?-It was not shifted bodily.  The man put up a new place
altogether.

15,994. Was that on Major Cameron's property?-No; neither in
the one case nor in the other.  I think he came off the Greenfield
property, and he built a place upon the Earl of Zetland's lands.

15,995. Was there no one removed from Major Cameron's
property in the neighbourhood of Uyea Sound, by Spence &
Co.?-I don't think there was.  There was a man there with a
lease of land who kicked up a row with us about a pier and other
things of kind, whose nephew, under his name was keeping a
shop, and we distinctly told him that he must turn his attention to
something else; that if he would use the house for a lodging-house
or something of that kind he could stay, but that we would not
allow him to do it under these circumstances.

15,996. Did he put up a shop elsewhere?-Yes.  They built a new
place to the west of Baltasound.

15,997. What were their names?-Isbister.  If I am not
misinformed, I think these parties are still carrying on the shop
at Uyea Sound, conducted by a man Donald Johnston; at least I
saw a boatload of goods coming ashore there, and on inquiry I
was told they were for Isbister's shop.

15,998. Do you think such an arrangement as you have made with
Spence & Co. is in any sense different as respects the interest of
the men from that by which a proprietor cures himself, and
employs his own tenants in the fishing?-In the way it is carried
out, I don't think there is very much difference; but had it been
carried out in the way that was intended and promised, it would
have been very different.  You must bear in mind that I don't think
it is for the interests of the working people in Shetland to have
scattald, and therefore it was intended that each man should have a
farm for himself, and a lease of it, and they have a right to that
under the lease to Spence & Co.  Had they stuck to that, or were
they to stick to that, they would be quite independent; but as they
persist in believing that the scattalds are for their benefit, and as
Spence & Co. have a right to these scattalds, it practically binds
them to the merchants.

15,999. I understand that Spence & Co, from their lease, have
absolute power to remove tenants if they don't comply with the
rules and regulations which, are appended to the lease?-I don't
think so, not without our sanction.  I know that we don't think so.

16,000. That, if it is so, would give them an absolute power to
compel the men to fish for them, just as much as when a landlord
intimates to his tenants that they must fish for his tacksman on
pain of removal.  Assuming that they have that power, is not that
the effect of it?-Assuming that they have that power, that would
be the effect of it, but I don't think they have that power.  It was
never intended that they should have it, and I don't think they have
it.  I hold that we alone have power to turn off the tenants, and
under the lease we only have power to bring in tenants.

16,001. The effect of the lease and the regulations appended to it,
so far as I have been able to examine it, appears to be, that if a
sub-tenant fails to comply with the rules and regulations appended
to the lease, he may be removed by the lessee?-No, we quite
deny that.

16,002. How do you reserve power under the lease to deal with
the sub-tenant who does not comply with the rules?-We exclude
assignees and sub-tenants, except as after-mentioned.

16,003. Perhaps the shortest way of dealing with that matter will
be, that I should have an opportunity of reading the lease or it copy
of it at leisure?-Certainly, but I may say decidedly that it was not
intended that Spence & Co. should have such a power, and it is not
being acted on, because we are now in process of warning four or
five tenants who will not come under the rules.  It was intended
distinctly that we reserved all our present tenants, irrespective of
Spence & Co. altogether.

16,004. But are not the powers with which Spence & Co. are
invested with regard to peats and other matters, really such as
to compel the tenants to remove if they do not comply with the
rules?-No.  The peats are reserved in our hands, for the purpose
of compelling them to take care of the peat-banks.

16,005. That is not Mr. Sandison's reading of the lease?-I cannot
help Mr. Sandison's reading of it but I am certain that it is the
correct reading, from the fact that there was a very considerable
correspondence carried on about Spence & Co. being allowed to
put in certain tenants during the first two or three years of their
lease.  They have only right to put in new tenants within a certain
time and after that they have no right to put anybody into a vacant
farm.

16,006. You were speaking of poor-rates: do you think there has
been no reduction of poor-rates in Shetland from any other cause
than the reduction of truck?-Not in my opinion.

16,007. Have there not been better crops and better seasons
lately?-Yes, but that does not reduce the number of paupers.
The number of paupers has been increased rather than reduced.

16,008. But if there are good seasons with regard to crops and
fishings, may not a greater number of paupers be maintained by
their own friends, and fewer people fall upon the rates?-That
might be so; but if the same number of paupers are on the roll, and
if the allowances are practically the same, it must follow that the
rates should be stationary.

16,009. Your statement is that the number of paupers has not been
reduced?-It has not been reduced.  It has been rather increased.  I
may mention that in Unst there has been a decrease from deaths,
but not anything to account for a reduction of the rates from 8s. to
2s. 6d.

16,010. With regard to the price of shawls, when you spoke of a
shawl being worth 25s. or 30s., did that apply to the merchants
who purchase shawls for goods, or to private dealers?-I referred
to what the shawls would be sold for to private individuals in the
town.

16,011. The prices which you name for shawls are not the prices
that were paid by merchants?-No; but with regard to that I may
mention that I have heard merchants from the south say that when
they sold goods to merchants here, in a great many cases they got
goods back.  There is a man named Saint in Aberdeen who deals
considerably with the merchants here, and perhaps he would be
able to give evidence as to whether he does not prefer to pay in
cash, but that to give goods is insisted upon by the merchants here.

16,012. Did you mean to say in an earlier part of your evidence
that the merchants here get supplies of goods mostly from
second-hand houses?-I mean to say that they could get them
from better houses if they chose.

16,013. Would you say that J. & R. Morley & Co.; Copestake,
Moore, & Co.; Stewart & M'Donald, Glasgow; Fletcher & Sons,
Manchester; J. & W. Campbell, Glasgow; Arthur & Co., Glasgow;
Mann, Byars, & Co. Glasgow; George Peek, Manchester, Vesey
& Sons, London; Allan & French, London, were second-class
houses?-No; but I should like to know the extent of business
which the merchants here do with them, and whether they deal
wholesale with them or not.

16,014. Would you be surprised to hear that Shetland merchants
engaged in the hosiery trade obtain the bulk of their goods from
such houses as these?-I should say that perhaps that was the
truth, but I should like to know the whole truth about the matter,
because [Page 406] these houses, large as they may be, have
certain clearances occasionally, which it may suit a people such as
those of Shetland to take.  I know at least one instance of a large
quantity of that class of goods coming down in the steamer, and
being damaged by a cask of porter being burst upon them, and
a claim was made upon the Leith and Clyde Shipping Co. for
something like 50 per cent. of profit, because it was a job lot
which had been bought from big houses of that kind.

16,015. But I suppose there are job lots bought by almost every
house at times?-Yes, but that has been the system here; in fact it
has been stated by people in these big businesses, that they did get
rid of their over-season's goods in that way.

16,016. I suppose over-season's goods come to all parts of the
rural districts of Scotland?-I am not aware of that, but they may
do so.

16,017. Is there anything else you wish to say?-Nothing that I am
aware of.


Lerwick, January 30, 1872, CHARLES OLLASON, examined.

16,018. You are a member of the firm of Charles Ollason & Son,
bootmakers, Lerwick?-Yes.

16,019. Did you receive that letter [showing] from Mr.
Williamson?-Yes.  [The following letter was put in:-]
'Haggersta, Jan. 20th 71.'
	'Messrs. Charles Ollason & Son.
	'Dear Sirs,-I am sorry to say that by some misunderstanding I
did not get the wages that I expected to get; for instead of a 3/4th I
only got a 1/2 share, and therefore instead of £18 I only got £12.  I
was due Mr. Stove £4 from the year that I was at the fishing from
him, and he handed in that bill against me to Mr. Irvine, who
retained that for him, so in that way I had nothing to get at all.
Therefore I am sorry to say that I cannot pay the 15s. that I am due
you for the boots that I got in August, and I beg that you will wait
till the turn of the season, and then I hope that I will be able to pay
you, for I am signed to go in the 'Olive' as a sharesman.  If you
cannot wait till then, you will be so good as to let me know.  You
will make out a bill, and I will sign it and hand it in to Mr. Irvine,
and let it be marked against me, and then you will be sure of your
money then-for it is entirely out of my power to pay you any
other way just now.  I beg that you will comply with my request, as
I can't do better.-Your humble Debtor,

						'M. Williamson,
	'Haggersta,
							'Whiteness.'

16,020. Was that letter written to you by him in answer to a
demand for payment of your account?-Yes.

16,021. Were you surprised to get a letter of that kind explaining
the reasons why your account was not paid?-We were not very
much surprised, for we believed the facts to be just as he stated
them.

16,022. Did you think it a reasonable enough explanation he was
not able to pay you?-Yes; it was reasonable enough for him.


Lerwick, January 30, 1872, JOHN WALKER, recalled.

16,023. I now show you Messrs. Hay & Co.'s store ledger, kept by
William Halcrow, their storekeeper here: was Halcrow the party
referred to in the report which you mentioned in your evidence?-
If Messrs. Hay & Co. say he is their superintendent, he is the same
individual.

16,024. Is Messrs. Hay & Co.'s the largest establishment of that
kind in Lerwick?-I understand so.

16,025. And the party mentioned in the report describes himself as
superintendent of the largest establishment in this place?-Yes,
general superintendent, and the other is described as the manager
of the working department.  The general superintendent is the one
who signs his name, and the other is the one who signs with a
cross, and they are the parties who speak about the resources of
science and art.

16,026. Is the book I now show you kept in a fair enough
mercantile hand?-Fair enough.

16,027. Would, you be surprised to hear that it was kept by
William Halcrow?-I would not.  The reason why I mentioned
this matter at all was to show the subserviency of the people in
Shetland,-that they are accustomed to do what they are bidden,-
that they are ready to sign their names to what they really cannot
understand, if they think it is doing a favour to any one above
them.

16,028. Do you think Halcrow was incapable of understanding
such a phrase as the resources of science and art?-I think so, as it
is applied here; because I may mention that in the correspondence
which passed before, and which refers to the same parties, they
said they did not know that whales had skins.


Lerwick, January 30, 1872, ARTHUR LAURENSON, recalled.

16,029. I understand you have heard the evidence which has been
given by Mr. Walker with regard to the merchants in Lerwick, and
that you wish to make some explanation in regard to it?-I have
not heard it, but the substance of it has been reported to me since I
entered the room.  I have been told that he said that the merchants
in Lerwick buy from second-class houses, and pay for their goods
by consignments of hosiery.  I wish to refute that, so far as I am
concerned; and I refer to Messrs. J. & W. Campbell, Glasgow;
Stewart & M'Donald, Glasgow; Arthur & Co., Glasgow; John
Clapperton & Co., Glasgow, and Geo. Peek & Co., Manchester,
as a proof that I deal with first-class houses.

16,030. Are these the only houses with which you deal?-No; I
deal with a good many more.

16,031. Are there any houses from which you get portions of your
goods which might be characterized as second-class houses?-No.

16,032. Is it the case that you ever get job lots or over-seasons
goods?-Never, unless in the ordinary way of trade.  Perhaps an
article may be shown to me by a traveller occasionally, but only
one pattern out of fifty which may be described as a job lot.

16,033. You do not get in a larger proportion of these goods than
other dealers in other country towns?-No; I never bought a job
lot altogether in my life.  We never pay by consignments of
hosiery.

16,034. Is there anything further you wish to state?-At the
close of my last examination I wished to make objection to the
credibility of a witness.  I was asked to state it privately, and I now
hand in paper with regard to it.  [Produces paper.]


Lerwick, January 30, 1872, ROBERT SINCLAIR, recalled.

16,035. Do you wish to concur with Mr. Laurenson in the
statement which he has now made?-Yes.  The only difference
is that I deal with more houses in London.

16,036. The list of houses which I read from in putting a question
to Mr. Walker was furnished by you?-Yes; but it does not include
one half of the houses that I deal with.  I wish also to say that I
have now been 25 years in business, and I never to this day
exchanged 2d. worth of hosiery goods for goods in the [Page 407]
south.  I do not mean to say that I have not bought hosiery goods
for goods here, but I have never exchanged them in the south for
other goods.*

16,037. Does any one present wish to give any further evidence?-
[No answer.]  Then I adjourn this inquiry.  I have to think the
Commissioners of Supply for the use of this room, which they
have kindly furnished to me; and I have also to return my thanks
to all parties in Shetland with whom I have met, for the courtesy
which I have received from them, and for the readiness which
they have shown in furnishing me with all information which I
required.

*Mr. Linklater also, on the same day, sent the following
letter to the Commissioner, referring to the same subject:-

LERWICK, 31st January 1872.
	W. GUTHRIE, Esq.

Sir,-I am sorry that I was absent when Mr. Walker in his
evidence before you today stated, as I have been told, that the
merchants here bartered their goods in exchange for drapery
goods from second-class warehouses in the south.  I beg to state
that I have been thirty-seven years in business here, and have paid
cash for all the goods ever I bought, and beg to refer you to the
following houses from whom I get my goods.-I am, sir, yours
very respectfully,

ROBERT LINKLATER.

J. & W. Campbell & Co., Glasgow; Stewart & M'Donald,
Glasgow; Arthur & Co., Glasgow; Anderson & Co., Glasgow; J.
Clapperton & Co., Glasgow; Chamberlain & Birrell, Glasgow;
John Howell & Co., St. Paul s, London; Fandel, Phillips, & Co.,
Newgate Street, London; Hutton & Co., Newgate Street, London;
D. Hyam, Houndsditch, London; Copestake, Moore, & Co.,

Bradford.


LERWICK: MONDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1872

<Present>-MR GUTHRIE.

<Mr. Guthrie>.-As I have been detained here longer than I
expected, owing to the state of the weather, I have held this
sitting to-day in order to examine some witnesses who were
formerly suggested to me by gentlemen in Lerwick, and whom
I was not able to call before closing the previous sittings, and
also some others who I think may be useful in supplementing the
evidence already taken.


Lerwick, February 5, 1872, Mrs. JOAN WINWICK or FORDYCE,
examined.

16,038. Do you live in Chromate Lane, Lerwick?-Yes.

16,039. Is your husband alive?-Yes.  He is a pensioner.  He was a
carpenter to trade, but he does nothing now.

16,040. Do you knit worsted work?-Yes, I knit, but for myself
only.  I knit with my own wool, and sell the goods.

16,041. Have you never knitted with merchants' wool?-No.

16,042. To whom do you generally sell your hosiery?-I always
sold it to Mr. Robert Sinclair since he became a merchant.  I
always knit haps or coarse shawls.

16,043. What do you pay for the worsted which you use in
knitting?-When I buy the worsted it is 2d. per hundred; but
when I buy the wool and spin it myself, it comes to be a great
deal dearer.  We cannot get proper worsted to buy, and we have to
manufacture it with our own hands.

16,044. Is the worsted which you buy at 2d. per hundred the kind
which you use for a hap of ordinary quality?-Yes.

16,045. At what price do you sell a hap two yards in size made of
that worsted?-Perhaps about 10s.

16,046. Have you any of these haps in hand just now?-No.

16,047. Have you sold any lately?-No; I have not sold any this
winter.  I have not been knitting this winter to sell.  I have just
been doing things for my own family.

16,048. What else have you knitted besides haps?-I have knitted
nothing but haps for a good while.  Since I could not see to do
finer work I have been spinning worsted and making frocks for
my husband, and stockings and things of that sort.

16,049. Where do you buy your worsted?-I have not bought
any worsted for a long time.  I always bought the wool and spun
it myself, because I could not get the worsted to buy.

16,050. Where did you buy your wool?-I buy skins from the
women who sell the sheep, and get the wool ru'ed off the sheep
when they are killed.

16,051. Are there women who go about and sell wool in that
way?-They sell mutton, but they will sell wool to us when we
go to their houses and ask them for it.

16,052. Do these women buy the whole sheep?-Yes, they buy
them alive; and when they have killed them, they sell the mutton
to any person in the town who will buy it.

16,053. Are there many such women?-I suppose there are a few,
but I cannot say how many.

16,054. Is that the way in which many people get their supply of
wool for spinning?-I think it is, because we cannot get wool in
any other way.

16,055. How much wool do you buy at a time?-I have bought
10s. or 12s. worth at a time,-just the skin as I could get it.

16,056. How much do you think you pay for the wool per lb. in
that way?-I have seen it cost me 2s. and 16d. and 18d.; but it has
been higher of late since the wool became so dear.

16,057. Is not that a very high price for it?-Yes.

16,058. Is it not more commonly about 1s. per lb.?-Yes.  When I
came to Lerwick it was 1s., 8d., and 6d.

16,059. Is it not still to be got at 1s. per lb.?-Perhaps it may be in
country places, where they have plenty of it; but I cannot get it for
1s. unless it is very coarse, and a great deal of refuse in it.

16,060. How much wool does it take to make a hap two yards
square?-About 2 lbs.  That would be 16 hundreds or cuts.

16,061. Are you speaking all this time of a hap of the ordinary
quality?-Yes, the ordinary quality.

16,062. Do you know what a woman gets for knitting a hap of that
kind when it is given out?-I cannot say exactly; but I think they
give some knitters for plain work only 2d. per hundred, or perhaps
a little more.  That is what they say they get for knitting plain
work.

16,063. Do they count the payment of the knitting by hundreds?-I
suppose some of them do, but I have never put out any to knit
myself, or taken any in to knit.

16,064. Then for a hap like that, if there were 16 hundreds in it,
the knitter would get only 2s. 8d. for the knitting?-Yes; but I
think that for knitting borders they get a little more.  It is for plain
frocks that they say they get 2d. per hundred.

16,065. Are you always paid in goods for your work?-Mr.
Sinclair always gave me what I asked.  When I asked a little
money I got it, and when I required goods for my family, such
as soap, soda, or tea, I got them too.

16,066. But I suppose it was understood that you were to be paid
in goods?-Yes, that was the custom of the place; but he always
trusted me with anything I wanted, if I happened to be due him
something at times.

[Page 408]

Lerwick, February 5, 1872, Mrs. ROSINA DUNCAN or SMITH,
examined.

16,067. Do you live in Lerwick?-Yes.

16,068. Is your husband alive?-Yes.  He is turning an old man
now, but he was at the sea at one time.

16,069. Has he got a pension?-No.

16,070. Do you employ yourself in knitting?-I knit a little for my
own family.

16,071. Have you given up knitting for other people-Yes.

16,072. Did you knit for Mr. Sinclair at one time?-I sold him a
few haps last year.

16,073. Did you sell him a great number before that-I did not;
but when I had any little things I sold them to Mr. Joseph Leask,
and got money articles for them.

16,074. Did you ever sell so many as half a dozen to Sinclair?-I
cannot say, for I did not count them.  The last one I sold was to
him.

16,075. What did you get for it?-12s.

16,076. How much wool was in it?-I cannot say, for I spun it
myself, and wrought it until it was done.

16,077. Do you not know how many cuts of worsted were in it?-
No; I did not count them.

16,078. What was the size of it?-I suppose it would be about two
yards.

16,079. Was it made of fine wool or ordinary wool?-It was just
the ordinary wool that is used for haps.

16,080. Were you paid in money or in goods for it?-I was paid
mostly in goods, but he gave me money without my asking for it.

16,081. How much money did you get?-1s. or so.  I could not
exactly say how much, but he gave me what I required.  I got the
goods which I required, and he gave me that money, and he also
gave me tea, which was the same as money, because if I had had to
buy it I would have had to pay for it.

16,082. Could you get money for the tea?-I did not sell it; I kept
it for my own use.

16,083. Did you ever sell anything that you got for hosiery?-No.
I always required anything I got for my own family.


Lerwick, February 5, 1872, GRACE SLATER, examined.

16,084. Are you a knitter in Lerwick?-Yes.

16,085. Do you do anything else?-I keep lodgers.  They are
generally workmen, such as masons.

16,086. Do you knit a good deal?-No; all that I do in that way is
very trifling.  It is generally fine veils that I knit.

16,087. Who do you sell them to?-Mr. Sinclair; I work for him;
he gives me the worsted.  It is Scotch worsted that I get, but I don't
know the quality of it, nor the price.

16,088. Have you got any of these veils in hand just now?-Yes, I
have a few that I am knitting.

16,089. Do you knit with your own wool at all?-No, I only work
for him.

16,090. How much do you get for knitting one of these veils?-
From 16d. to 1s., according to the quality as it is coarse or fine.

16,091. Do you get more for knitting one of fine worsted than one
of coarse?-Yes.

16,092. Will you bring one of the veils that you are knitting just
now and let me see it?-Yes,


Lerwick, February 5, 1872, ELIZABETH MALCOMSON, recalled.

16,093. Do you live with your mother in Baker's Close,
Lerwick?-Yes.

16,094. What do you do?-I sometimes knit, and sometimes sew;
but I mostly knit.  My mother knits sometimes, and does the
house-work.

16,095. Do you support yourself mostly by knitting?-Yes, almost
entirely.

16,096. What kind of knitting do you do?-Fine veils and shawls.

16,097. Are you paid for them in money or in goods?-Always in
goods.

16,098. Do you sometimes get a little money?-No, I never asked
for it.

16,099. Do you get money for your sewing?-Yes.  I sew to
private people, and they always pay me in money.

16,100. Where do you buy your provisions?-From any shop I
like.  I don't go to any one in particular.

16,101. Where do you get the money for that?-From my sewing.

16,102. Do you get all the money that you require for provisions
by your sewing?-No.  We generally keep a lodger or two when
we can get them.

16,103. Would you not prefer to get some money for your
knitting?-Yes; but it never was the practice to ask for it,
and therefore I never thought of doing so.

16,104. Would you not be better off if you had money for your
knitting, which you could spend upon provisions?-I think I would
be; but I never thought of asking it, as it is not the usual thing.

16,105. What kind of goods do you get for your knitting?-Tea,
sugar, soft goods, groceries, or any kind of goods that are in the
shop.

16,106. Do you get most of the dress for yourself in that way?-
Yes.

16,107. Do you knit a greater number of articles than are sufficient
to supply yourself with dress?-Yes.

16,108. What do you do with them?-I buy anything that is
required for the house.

16,109. Do you sometimes get goods for your friends if they want
any?-No, I generally require all I get for myself.

16,110. You don't get provisions for your knitting?-No.

16,111. Do you get enough money for your sewing and from your
lodgers to supply you with provisions all the year round?-Yes; it
has always done so in time past.

16,112. Is there anybody living in family with you except your
mother?-No.

16,113. What is the usual price that you get for your fine
shawls?-We generally get 10s. or 12s., but that is not the
very finest worsted either.

16,114. Are these shawls knitted with the merchant's worsted?-
Yes.

16,115. It is always given out to you, and you keep an account?-
Yes.

16,116. Do you know what quality of worsted it is that you knit
one of these shawls with?-It is usually Shetland worsted.  The
price of it is 31/2d., and some of it 4d. per cut; at least I would think
so, judging by the fineness of the worsted.

16,117. Have you sometimes bought worsted yourself?-Yes,
sometimes.

16,118. Have you bought it often enough to know the quality and
price?-Yes.

16,119. What size of shawl is it that you get 12s. for?-About 21/4
yards.  That, is, 25 scores on each border, and there are four
borders in the square.

16,120. Then you could say quite positively that for a shawl of 25
scores, knitted with 31/2d. worsted, and measuring 21/4 yards, you
got 12s. in goods?-Yes.

16,121. Do you ever sell shawls to any persons except the
merchants?-No.

16,122. When did you last take any veils to the shop?-I think
it was the week before last.  I got 9d. each for them; they were
knitted with Scotch wool.  When they are coarse, there is less paid
for knitting than when they are fine.

16,123. Were these coarse veils?-No, they were ordinary quality.
The worsted was not the very coarsest.

16,124. Do you know what was the value of the worsted per
cut?-I cannot say.

16,125. Who did you sell them to?-To Mr. Robert Linklater.

16,126. Do you know what you would pay for them at the shop?-
I think it would be about 2s. or 2s. 6d.

16,127. Would you go and buy one of them and bring it to me
here?-Yes.

[Page 409]

Lerwick, February 5, 1872, GRACE SLATER, recalled.

16,128. [Produces veil.]  Is that one of the veils you are knitting for
Mr. Sinclair just now?-Yes.  It is his own worsted that I am
working it with.  I think I will get 16d. for it.  I have got that for
veils of the same quality.

Lerwick, February 5, 1872, ROBERT SINCLAIR, recalled.

16,129. Do you wish to make any explanation with regard to what
the witness Grace Slater has now said?-The only explanation I
have to make is, that the veil she has now produced belongs to the
same class of goods as that with regard to which Mr. Linklater and
I were previously examined.  The veil which she has produced is
quite a good thing, but in the same class of goods there are a great
number of job articles which tear in the dressing.

16,130. What is the selling price of such veils?-From 2s. 6d. to
2s. 9d.  That is the highest price we get for them.

16,131. What quantity of worsted is in one of them?-About 6d.
worth of worsted.

16,132. Is that two cuts of 3d. worsted?-No, it is mohair.  But
there will be other veils of the same kind which will be worth not
more than 18d. or 20d., and therefore the profit which we get upon
one veil is no proof as to the amount of profit, if any, which is got
upon the whole.

16,133. What quantity of worsted is there in a veil like that?-
About 1/4 oz.  The price of that worsted is about 36s. now, but I
paid 32s. 6d. for it.  Taking it at 32s., that would be 2s. per oz.,
and therefore 1/4 oz. would be 6d.

16,134. How many bad lots might you have in an ordinary time
in such veils?-The only way of getting at that would be by
examining our books.  This very season I had a lot of about 30
dozen veils, which cost me altogether about £45, and I sold them
for about the lot.

16,135. How did that happen?-Just because I could get no more
for them.  I would have been very glad to have got more if I could.
I may mention that there is not 20 per cent. of these veils which
realize the price I have mentioned of 33s. per dozen, although they
all cost that price.  Most of them run about 2s. 2d. or 2s., or
something like that.


Lerwick, February 5, 1872, ELIZABETH MALCOMSON, recalled.

16,136. [Produces black veil.]  Have you bought this veil from Mr.
Linklater?-Yes.  He says these veils sell at 18s. a dozen, or 1s.
6d. apiece; but this one is undressed, and therefore I only paid 1s.
41/2d. for it.

16,137. Is this one of the veils which you knitted, and for which
you got 9d.?-Yes.

16,138. Do you not know the value of the worsted required for
it?-No.

16,139. You said you know the value of the worsted in the shawls
you knit?-Yes.

16,140. Then how do you not happen to know the value of the
worsted in the veil?-Because I knitted them for myself in the one
case, and in the other I always got the worsted to knit them with.

Lerwick, February 5, 1872, ALEXANDER MUNRO, examined.

16,141. What are you?-I am second officer of Customs at the
port of Lerwick.

16,142. How long have you been in that position?-Fully five
years.

16,143. Were you here before it was usual to pay the seamen
engaged in the Greenland voyages at the Custom House
regularly?-No; I came here in the first year that the special
regulations came into effect-1867.

16,144. Did it come under your notice after you came here, that
the men who received their wages at the Custom House were
frequently indebted to the agents by whom they were engaged?-I
am not cognisant of the fact whether they were indebted or not.

16,145. Were you not aware that settlements were sometimes
made with the clerk of the agents, or the agents themselves, for
accounts due to them at the time when the men were receiving
their wages before the superintendent?-Yes, I understood so.

16,146. Was that frequent during the first year that you were
here?-Yes.

16,147. Were these settlements actually made in 1867 in the
Custom House?-There were deductions taken from the balances
shown to be due to the seamen, in addition to the deductions
specified in the agreement.

16,148. Did the superintendent interfere to prevent these
deductions from being made in his office?-Yes; the parties
were interfered with by the superintendent, and the practice
was stopped.

16,149. Was that in 1867 or subsequently?-I think it must have
been in 1869 or 1870.

16,150. Did the practice go on without interruption or objection
until that time?-Not without interruption.  We tried to stop it, but
we did not succeed altogether until 1869 or 1870.

16,151. Since that time has any attempt been made, within your
knowledge, to make a deduction of that kind in the Custom
House?-Not so far as I am aware.

16,152. Have you been aware whether seamen have received the
money payable to them under deduction of the agent's account in
any case?-I could not positively say, but I think I have seen it
done.

16,153. Have you suspected that the seamen were receiving only a
part of what was really payable to them?-Yes.

16,154. What reason had you to suspect that?-Because I could
see them keeping the deduction off.

16,155. Is the money usually counted in presence of the
superintendent or of yourself?-Yes.

16,156. Has that always been so?-No.  It should always be done,
but it has not been done at all times.

16,157. Is there sometimes a press of business which prevents
it?-Yes, sometimes; and you cannot always keep your eye
watching everybody.

16,158. Do the cases to which you refer, occur when there is a
press of business?-Occasionally.

16,159. Are you aware that seamen coming to receive their wages
at the Custom House have usually had a settlement with the agent
beforehand at his office?-I am not aware of that.

16,160. Have you found, in the course of your experience, whether
the seamen, when paid at the Custom House, generally know the
amount of their account at the agent's shop?-I am not aware of
that either.

16,161. Have you at any time heard the agent, or his clerk, while
settling with the seamen, or after settling with them, in presence of
the superintendent, remind them that they had to go down to his
office and pay their account?-I cannot say positively that I have
heard the agents say that to the men, but I know that it was an
understood thing that they should do so.

16,162. Is it not so now?-I fancy it is.

16,163. How did you know that it was understood?-I have
overheard the agent and the men talking about it between
themselves in the office.  I could not exactly bring the words to
my remembrance which I have heard used, but I have seen cases
where a small balance might be due, and when the agent did not
have change to settle with a man, he said he would settle when he
came to settle the other account at the shop.

16,164. The matter has come under your notice in that way, so that
you have come to be aware that it is a usual thing for the men to go
down and pay their accounts [Page 410] after having been settled
with at the Custom House?-I should fancy it has.

16,165. Have you had anything to do with the engagement of
seamen?-Occasionally.

16,166. Are they ever engaged in presence of the
superintendent?-For foreign-going vessels they are
always engaged there.

16,167. Are they so engaged for the Greenland and sealing
vessels?-Yes.

16,168. Is the agent present then and the captain of the vessel?-
Yes.

16,169. Is the selection of the men usually left to the agent, or does
the master of the vessel exercise a choice?-I fancy the agent
collects the men and the master selects them out of the crowd.

16,170. Does the agent interfere with the selection?-I am not
aware.  They are all selected before they come before us.

16,171. Have you noticed whether in recent years the number of
young hands engaged in the sealing and whaling voyages has been
less than it was when you first came to the office?-I have not
observed that.

16,172. Have you heard any of the men complain that they could
not get their wages paid when they wanted them?-I have heard
complaints with regard to the second payment of oil-money.  The
men said the agent had not got his return, or something to that
effect, that he was not aware of the quantity being ascertained.

16,173. Is that the only complaint you have heard on the
subject?-I think so.

16,174. Do you know whether there was any difficulty or objection
on the part of the agents to comply with the regulations when they
were issued?-There was little bit of difficulty, and I have no
doubt there was little objection at the time.

16,175. What was the ground of it?-I cannot say, except that it
was troublesome.

16,176. Was there no objection made to you or in your
presence?-No; I cannot bring a case of that kind to
recollection.

16,177. Then what was the difficulty or objection that you refer
to?-I suppose it was the compulsion of bringing the men forward
to be discharged, and producing store-books, and all that.

16,178. Do you mean that the agents do not like to have the
settlement made in presence of the superintendent at all?-I don't
mean to say that exactly; but I mean that it gave them a good deal
of extra trouble, and it was sometimes disagreeable.

16,179. You have said that there was a good deal of difficulty
in getting them complied with at first: do you remember any
explanation or reason that was given by the agents for that?-The
first year I came here the master of each vessel had to get a
store-book, in which were entered the goods or whatever extra
stores might be supplied to the men during the voyage, and I have
known these books coming ashore signed by the master and the
men when they came into the agents' hands, as it proof of their
correctness.  Then the shop goods which had been supplied to the
families of the men during their absence were entered in, but we
had to compel them to deduct these and delete the entries.

16,180. Was that a difficulty which you had in 1867?-Yes, the
first year.

16,181. Did you find it to exist after 1867?-No; we stopped it at
once.

16,182. Then in 1868 there was still a difficulty, as you have
already said, in getting the regulations enforced: what was the
difficulty then?-The only difficulty then was the agent deducting
his own account from the balance shown in the men's account, and
handing over the net balance only.

16,183. That did not appear in any written accounting that took
place before you?-No.

16,184. Have you seen that attempted so lately as 1870 or 1871?-
Not in 1871, I think.  I rather think the last time was in 1870, but I
could not be positive.

16,185. Are the rules strictly observed now?-So far as we can
attend to them, they are.

16,186. Are you not able to attend to them?-Yes.

16,187. Then they are attended to?-Yes.

16,188. What did you mean by qualifying your answer, and saying,
so far as you could attend to them?-I meant by taking steps to
stop all these informalities.

16,189. But there are no informalities now?-No.

16,190. Is there no delay now in settling?-There is delay in
settling, most undoubtedly.

16,191. Is that not strictly prohibited by the regulations?-I don't
think it is.  There are five days allowed for settling, according to
the Act; but here it takes five or six or seven or eight months.

16,192. What is the cause for that in your opinion?-I cannot say.

16,193. Have you any doubt that the men would come forward to
be settled with if they were instructed to do so by the agent and the
master of the ship?-I should think they would, and be paid within
a day or so after the ship's arrival.  I think that would be far better
for all parties.

16,194. Are you aware whether there is any difficulty in making up
the statutory accounts of wages which justifies a delay of five or
six months in settling?-No.  I think they can be made up in the
course of ten hours for any whaling crew.

16,195. But there may be a difficulty in making up the account at
the agent's shop, may there not?-I don't know.  They might have
that prepared beforehand, if it was necessary.

16,196. Do you know whether the effect of the delay which so
occurs is to make the men incur larger accounts at the agent's
shop?-I am not aware of that.

16,197. Have you ever heard any statement from the men to the
effect that they had to go to the shop during that period of
delay?-I never did.

16,198. Do you think it is the fault of the men that the settlements
are so long delayed?-There is no doubt a fault on the part of the
men, because, if they go away to their homes in the distant islands,
there must necessarily be a difficulty in collecting them again.

16,199. But is it not the custom to let them away in the first
instance without directing them to come and receive their
wages?-I think so.

16,200. Do you know whether they have ever been strictly ordered
to attend for that purpose by the master of the ship?-Not to my
knowledge.

16,201. Where are the men usually landed from these whaling
vessels?-They are sometimes landed at the lighthouse, sometimes
at Scalloway, sometimes at Sumburgh Head, but most commonly
at Lerwick harbour.

16,202. Are nine out of every ten landed there?-No, but more the
one half of them are landed in Lerwick harbour.


Lerwick, February 5, 1872, Mrs. MARGARET SMITH or GIFFORD,
examined.

16,203. Do you live in Lerwick?-Yes.

16,204. Do you knit haps?-Yes; but only a few, because I am
getting old and weak, and I am not so able to work as I used to be.

16,205. Have you knitted lately for Mr. Sinclair?-I have knitted
for him for a long time.  I think it is about a fortnight since I sold
my last hap to him.  It was between 11/2 and 13/4 yards.

16,206. What kind of wool was it made of?-Just common wool
of different kinds-grey and black and white.

16,207. Was it worth about 2d. per hundred?-It would be worth
about that.

16,208. What did you sell it for?-6s.; that was what I commonly
got for these little haps.

16,209. Did you sell it for that price in goods?-I was to get
anything I wanted.  I have something to get yet.  I got tea and
soap, or anything I required, and I shall get the rest as I need it.

16,210. Was that about the ordinary price which you got for a hap
of that size and quality?-Yes.  If I could make them bigger, I
would get more money, perhaps 10s., and from that down to 6s.

[Page 411]

16,211. How long have you been dealing with Mr. Sinclair?-I
have dealt with him from 1840 or 1845.

16,212. Have you always been paid by him in goods during that
time?-Yes, when I asked them; but if I asked any other thing I
got whatever I asked.

16,213. Have you bought articles for money in Mr. Sinclair's
shop?-It was not very often that he got any money from us; but
when I wanted anything from him, I found there was no difference
whether I paid for it in money or in goods.

16,214. Do you mean that you paid the same price for the goods
which you bought, whether you paid for them in money or in
hosiery?-Just the same; I never saw any difference.

16,215. Are there not two prices in Mr. Sinclair's shop?-Not so
far as I know; but I can only speak for myself.


Lerwick, February 5, 1872, WILLIAM GARRIOCK, examined.

16,216. Do you live in Sandsting parish?-Yes.

16,217. Are you serving in the Naval Reserve in Lerwick just
now?-Yes.

16,218. Have you been bred to the sea?-Yes.

16,219. Where have you been at sea?-I have gone to Greenland
and Davis Straits, for the most part.

16,220. Have you ever been at the Faroe fishing or at the ling
fishing?-No.

16,221. Have you been south?-Yes, I was south for a short time;
but I have generally gone to the seal or whale fishing since I was
able to go.

16,222. From what agents have you got your engagement?-From
Mr. Joseph Leask, Mr. George Reid Tait, and Messrs. Laurenson
& Co.

16,223. How long have you been doing that?-Since 1854.  I have
been in Greenland almost every year since then.

16,224. Did you always get your outfit from the agent with whom
you were engaged?-Always.

16,225. And some supplies for your family besides?-Yes.

16,226. Did you keep an account in the agent's shop, from which
your family got what they wanted during your absence?-Yes.

16,227. Did your wife get all her supplies from Lerwick?-No; she
got most of them from shops in our own neighbourhood, because it
was a long distance to come to Lerwick; but sometimes she sent
here, and sometimes not.

16,228. Why did she send here for them?-Sometimes she had to
send here for money when she could not get money from her
neighbours.

16,229. Did she get money here whenever she wanted it?-Yes, so
far as ever I knew.

16,230. Did she have allotment notes?-Yes, towards the end of
the time, but not at first.

16,231. Did you always take allotment notes for her use while you
were absent?-I have done so lately.

16,232. Are these allotment notes taken in her name?-Yes; but
sometimes I have been so much indebted to the agent before I left,
that I had to leave the allotment note with him until he was paid.

16,233. Have you done that lately?-Yes.

16,234. Had you been in his debt before you engaged with him?-
No.  I got into his debt at the time of engaging.  I got a lot of things
from him then.

16,235. Did you leave your allotment note in his hands as a
security for the payment of these supplies?-Yes.

16,236. Was the note taken in the agent's name?-No; it was
taken in my wife's name, and she was supplied by him if she
required anything.

16,237. Who was the agent you engaged with last year?-Messrs.
Laurenson & Co.  I also engaged with them the year before.  The
year before that, I think I engaged with Mr. Joseph Leask.

16,238. In all these years did you run up a pretty large account at
the agent's shop?-Yes; I always had an account with the agent.

16,239. Did you settle that account before you went up to the
Custom House to be paid your wages?-No.  Sometimes the agent
was at the Custom House to receive payment of his account there,
and sometimes I went down to his shop and paid him after I had
been paid myself.

16,240. But was the account settled in the book, and the amount
due by you to him ascertained before you went up to the Custom
House?-Yes.

16,241. Was that done always?-No, not of late.

16,242. Why did you get supplies from Lerwick when you could
have got them nearer home, without giving your wife the trouble
of sending so far for them?-Sometimes, perhaps, I could not get
credit from a neighbour.

16,243. Could your wife not have got money from the agent in
Lerwick by sending in her allotment note to him?-If I was in debt
to the agent, I could not expect him to advance money until he was
paid his debt; but I never saw an agent refusing money, even
although there was an account due to him.

16,244. Did you ever ask money and get it when there was an
account due?-Yes.

16,245. Do you mean that your wife asked for money when you
were away?-Yes.

16,246. Did she require it for any particular purpose when she
asked it in that way?-I cannot say.

16,247. Did you ever know of her asking for money in order to buy
supplies near home?-No, I never knew that.

16,248. Do you think she would have been likely to?-I don't
think it.  I think if she had ever done it, I would have known.

16,249. Do you think she would have got the money if she had
asked it for that purpose?-I am sure she would.

16,250. Then why did she not do it instead of carrying her supplies
all the way from Lerwick?-I don't know as to that.

16,251. How far is it from Lerwick to your place?-I never heard
of it being measured, but I should say it is over twenty miles.

16,252. You say the agent keeps your allotment notes, even
although they are in name of your wife?-Yes, if I am indebted
to him.

16,253. Don't they require to be signed by your wife?-Not at
first.

16,254. But afterwards?-Yes; if she has a note, then of course she
has to sign it before she gets the money.

16,255. But she does not require to sign it when she gets supplies;
these are set down to the account?-Yes; she does not require to
sign it unless she is drawing her half-pay at the Custom House.

16,256. Has she ever drawn her half-pay, so long as you
remember?-Yes.

16,257. Is that long ago?-It is perhaps a couple of years ago.

16,258. How much of it did she draw then?-She drew half a
month's pay every month when I was away.

16,259. What did she do with that?-I suppose she required it.

16,260. Did she spend it at home or in Lerwick?-I cannot say.

16,261. Was the allotment note in the agent's hands at that
time?-No.

16,262. She had got the allotment note that year herself?-Yes.

16,263. You had sent it to her before you went away?-Yes.

16,264. Then at that time you had not run up a large account with
the agent?-Not very much.

16,265. Had you any account with the agent that year at all?-I
don't remember; I don't think it was very much.

16,266. There might have been a little for some articles of outfit,
perhaps?-Perhaps there was.

16,267. When you settle at the Custom House, are you ever told by
the agent's clerk who goes up to hand [Page 412] you the money,
that he expects you down at the shop to settle your account
there?-Yes; but I usually go first to the shop and see what my
account with the agent there is, and then I pay him immediately
afterwards, either at the Custom House or at the shop, as soon as
I am paid myself.

16,268. Are you expected to go down and pay your account at
once?-Yes.

16,269. Are you ever spoken to about going at once?-No, I have
never been told to go at once; but I understand it is my business to
pay it at once, as long as I am able to do it.

16,270. Is it expected that the men going on a Greenland voyage
are to take their supplies, partly at least, from the agent's shop?-I
don't know if it is expected or not.  I suppose it is expected, but a
man may buy his outfit wherever he pleases.

16,271. Did you ever know a man buying it elsewhere than at the
agent's shop?-I have bought some articles elsewhere myself.

16,272. Did you ever buy the whole of your articles anywhere
else?-Yes.

16,273. Why did you buy any of them elsewhere?-I was not very
particular about where I went.  If I had money in my hand I went
to any place that was most suitable, or where I could get the most
suitable articles.

16,274. Did you often do that?-Not often.  I more frequently had
an account with the agent.

16,275. When you go to make an engagement in the agent's shop
for a voyage, are you sometimes asked if you want anything?-No,
I am never asked that, unless if I happen to be running an account
he may ask if have got all my things, or something like that.

16,276. Does he not usually ask you that?-I cannot say that he
does.

16,277. Is there any difficulty nowadays in getting berths in
Greenland ships?-Sometimes there is because there are not
many ships that come here.

16,278. Are there more men than berths?-Sometimes that is the
case.

16,279. When that is the case, what kind of men have the best
chance of being engaged?-I don't know.

16,280. Do you think a man who owes an account to the agent,
or who is to keep an account with him, has a better chance than
another?-I cannot say that he has.

16,281. Do you think the men have that impression?-I believe
they do have that impression; but whether it is a right impression
or not I cannot say.

16,282. Have you learned from some of the men themselves that
such an impression exists?-No, not from the men themselves.

16,283. Then how do you know that they think so?-I have no real
knowledge on the subject; only I know that is said to be the case.

16,284. Who says it?-I cannot mention any particular person that
I have heard it from.  Perhaps when they see a man engaged for a
ship, when they do not have a chance themselves, they may think
there is some cause like that to account for it.

16,285. Then some of the men do think that they have a better
chance of a berth if they have an account with the agent?-I have
merely heard that said; I have no experience of it myself.

16,286. Do you think that if you were not to come down from the
Custom House at once and pay your account in the agent's shop,
you would have a chance of getting a berth from that agent next
year?-I believe I would.

16,287. Why do you think so?-Because, if I was due the agent an
account, he might perhaps think that I would make a better voyage
in another year, and that I might then be more able to pay him.

16,288. But do you think he would have anything to do with you
if you refused to pay your account to him at the settlement in
November: do you think in that case that you would have a chance
of getting another engagement from him in February or March?-I
suppose I would have a chance.

16,289. Would he not say that he would have nothing more to do
you, because you had not paid your previous account?-No; I
never saw that done.

16,290. Is that because you have always paid your account in
proper time?-I don't know; but I always have paid my account
when I could.

16,291. Did you ever know of any man who did not pay his
account to the agent as soon as he got his money at the Custom
House?-No, I never knew of any man who did not do that.

16,292. Did you ever hear that spoken of?-No; I never heard
about anything of that kind.

16,293. Did you never hear the men talk among themselves about
that matter?-No.

16,294. What do you think would happen if you did not go down at
once to the agent's shop and pay your account whenever you got
your money at the Custom House?-So far as I know, I don't think
anything would happen at all.

16,295. Do you think the agent would look after you?-I have
been due things myself for about a year but he never looked after
me.  That was before I was paid at the Custom House.

16,296. Then you had settled with the agent in office on that
occasion?-Yes; and left a balance due.

16,297. Were you due that balance to the agent for twelve months
afterwards?-Yes.

16,298. Did the same agent get you a berth in a Greenland ship in
the following year?-No; I left that agent and went to another for
that year.

16,299. Did that other agent take the balance over and become
responsible for it?-Yes; it was brought into the next agent's
books.

16,300. Who was the agent who took over your debt in that
way?-I was once due an account in that way to Mr. George
Reid Tait, and I afterwards found it in Mr. Leask's books.

16,301. Did you not know of that until you found it in Mr. Leask's
books at settlement?-I knew I was due the account.

16,302 You knew you were due it to Mr. Tait but did you know
that it had been transferred to Mr. Leask until you found it in the
book?-No; I did not know that until then.

16,303. Were you surprised to find it charged in Mr. Leask's books
against you?-No; I was not surprised at all.

16,304. Did you expect to find it there?-No, not exactly; but of
course I would have paid it if I had been able.

16,305. Did that happen to you more than once?-No; only once,
to my recollection, in that way.

16,306. Did it ever happen to you in any other way-It happened
once in this way: that I supposed I was due an account to Mr.
Leask in one year, and I found the account standing in his books
against me next year.

16,307. Did you change your agent that year?-No.

16,308. How long is it since your account with Mr. Tait was
transferred to Mr. Leask?-I cannot say exactly, but I think it
will be more than twelve years ago.

16,309. Have you never had a balance against you since at
settlement?-No.


Lerwick, February 5, 1872, ROSS GEORGESON, examined.

16,310. Are you a seaman living at Scalloway?-Yes; I am skipper
of a Faroe smack.

16,311. In whose employment have you been lately?-Mr.
Leask's.

16,312. For how many years have you gone to the Faroe fishing?-
I have gone every year for about fifteen or sixteen years.

16,313. Are you now serving your time in the Naval Reserve?-
Yes.

[Page 413]

16,314. Have you always had an account in the books of Mr. Leask
when you were engaged in his smacks?-Yes.

16,315. Did you settle that account with him every year?-Yes.

16,316. Have you been employed in his service at any other part of
the year, except when you went to the Faroe fishing?-No; but
lately I have gone a voyage or two to the south with fish in winter.

16,317. Do your family get their supplies from Mr. Leask's shop in
Lerwick?-Yes.

16,318. All the year round?-No; only when it is convenient.
For instance, when we go round to Scalloway with the vessel, we
generally take a good stock of things with us, which helps us
through part of the season.

16,319. Do you not take goods across the country to Scalloway
sometimes when any of your family happen to be in Lerwick?-
Only very little.

16,320. Do you settle about December or January every year?-
Generally about the 1st of December.

16,321. Do you get the balance which is due to you then in
cash?-Yes.

16,322. Do you sometimes get advances in money during the
course of the year?-Yes; I get what I require.

16,323. How much do you generally get in money before the
settlement?-Generally between summer and winter I may run
an account of about £30 or £40 for myself and the vessel.

16,324. But what do you get in your private account?-Just what
money I require, and what I ask.  I may perhaps ask £4 or £5 or £6
at a time, just as I need it.

16,325. Is it for any particular purpose that you ask for so much?-
No; there is no particular purpose ever mentioned.

16,326. Do you think you would get all the money that was due to
you at any time before settlement if you asked for it?-I have no
doubt of that; but there is generally an account run.

16,327. Do you take out goods in the course of the year when you
want them?-Yes, when it is convenient to get them to Scalloway.

16,328. Suppose you did not take out any goods at all, but wanted
to get the whole in cash, do you suppose you would get that?-
Yes.

16,329. Have you ever asked for it all in cash?-No; because I
leave my money along with Mr. Leask.

16,330. What do you mean by leaving your money along with
him?-I get the same interest for my money when it is in his
hands as I would get from the bank.

16,331. Then when you settle you don't always draw the whole
balance that is due to you?-No.

16,332. You leave it in Mr. Leask's hands, and get interest allowed
to you for it in your next account?-Yes.

16,333. Did you always have an account with him?-Yes.

16,334. Do all the men in the smacks keep accounts with the
owner of the smack for their supplies?-Yes, so far as I know.

16,335. Do they all get money when they ask for it?-I never
heard anything else.  I never heard any man say that he had asked
for money and did not get it.

16,336 Do they generally ask for much money?-I don't know.  I
suppose every man asks for what he requires, or according to what
he has to get.

16,337. Are they not expected to get their supplies at the
merchant's shop?-It is just as they like.

16,338. Of course it is just as they like, but are they not expected
to get a part of their supplies in the shop?-I suppose so.  They
always do so.

16,339. Are there as many men to be had for the Faroe fishing as
are wanted to man the smacks?-Yes.  There has been no scarcity
in time past.

16,340. Do you know of any men who go to the Faroe fishing and
draw money from the owner in the course of the season for the
support of their families, and who do not get any supplies at all?-
No. , They generally take their goods for the voyage from the
merchant, whether they take anything else or not; but I never knew
any men who did not take some supplies from him.


Lerwick, February 5, 1872, ARTHUR MOFFAT, examined.

16,341. Are you a seaman living at Lochside, Lerwick?-Yes.

16,342. Are you now serving in the Naval Reserve?- Yes.

16,343. Where have you been employed?-I have been going to
the seal and whale fishing.

16,344. Have you ever been at Faroe or at the ling fishing?-No.

16,345. What agents have you engaged with for the Greenland
voyage?-I have been out for the whole of them.

16,346. Did you always keep an account for supplies with the
agent who engaged you?-Yes.

16,347. Was that settled at his office before 1867?-Yes.

16,348. Since that year it has been settled at the Custom House?-
Yes.

16,349. Do you always go straight down from the Custom House
to the agent's office and pay your account?-Yes.

16,350. Are you expected to go straight down?-I don't know, but
I think it my duty to do so.

16,351. Are you expected to take some of your supplies from the
agent who engages you?-We just take them as we require them.

16,352. But if you require supplies or an outfit, are you expected
to take them from the agent who engages you?-Yes, we can do
nothing else but take them from him; we cannot go to a strange
shop for them, because they would not give them to us.

16,353. Why would they not give you credit at it strange shop?-
Because they do no business with us, and perhaps they would not
know us.

16,354. Would you not have your first month's pay in advance
with which to buy what you wanted?-Not very often, because I
don't take it out in that way.

16,355 But you could it?-Yes.

16,356. And if you had it you could get what you wanted at
another shop?-Yes.

16,357. When you go in to engage with an agent does he, or do his
shop-people, ask you if you want anything?-No.

16,358. Do you generally get an advance note?-Yes, we get it,
but we leave it with the agent; at least I do.

16,359. Why do you leave it with the agent?-Because I find the
half-pay too little for the support of my wife and family during my
absence.  They require more supplies than that, and they get them
out of the agent's shop.

16,360. Has that been your practice for a long time?-It has.

16,361. Have you always engaged with the same agent for a
number of years back?-Yes, I have engaged with Mr. Leask
for some time.

16,362. Have you always got your supplies at his shop?-Yes.

16,363. You said you could not get credit anywhere else: is that
because Mr. Leask has the command of the money you are to
get?-No, it is not that, because we get the money if we want it.

16,364. You could get the money if you wanted it on an allotment
note, but not otherwise?-Yes.

16,3 65. Do you say that you could get a larger amount of supplies
at Mr. Leask's shop than your allotment note would pay for if you
had it?-I do.

16,366. Have you a balance to receive at the end of the year when
you settle with Mr. Leask?-Generally.

16,367. Are you never in his debt at settlement?-No.

[Page 414]

16,368. Does your wife get cash from Mr. Leask when she wants
it?-Yes.

16,369. How much does she generally get?-I don't know.

16,370. Did she ever get 5s. at a time?-Perhaps she got the whole
half-pay at a time if she wanted it, or the half of it.

16,371. Was that if she wanted it for any particular purpose, such
as for paying rent?-Yes, or any necessary thing.

16,372. But it was only for a necessary purpose that she got it?-I
suppose so.

16,373. Is it generally understood among the men in the whaling,
that they ought to deal with the agent who engages them for a
voyage?-No.  We can deal with any person we like.

16,374. But don't they always deal with the agent who engages
them, taking their outfit and their supplies for home from him?-
Yes.

16,375. Do you think that if a man did not deal with the agent he
would be as likely to get a berth next year as if he had kept an
account with him?-Just the same; I never found any difference.

16,376. But did you ever go to another agent for your supplies than
the one who had engaged you?-No, not in that particular season;
but I have changed agents occasionally.

16,377. How long is it since you were engaged by another agent
than Mr. Leask?-Two years.   I changed from Laurenson & Co.
to Mr. Leask then.

16,378. Why did you change?-Just to fall in with the ship that I
wanted to go in.  That was my only reason.

16,379. Were you clear with Laurenson & Co. when you
changed?-Yes.


Lerwick, February 5, 1872, JAMES LAURENSON, examined.

16,380. Are you a seaman residing at Mews, in Dunrossness?-I
am.

16,381. Are you serving at present in the Naval Reserve?-Yes.

16,382. What trade have you been engaged in as a seaman?-I
have mostly been in the south.

16,383. Have you been in the Faroe fishing?-No.

16,384. Have you been at the ling fishing?-I was two years in the
ling fishing at Mews, about eight or nine years ago, for Mr. Robert
Mullay.

16,385. Did you keep accounts with him then for your supplies?-
Not for supplies, only for fishing material.

16,386. Did you get any advances of money from him?-I did not
ask for any; I did not want them at the time.

16,387. Would you have got advances of money if you had asked
for them when you were not taking supplies?-I expect I would.

16,388. But you did not want the money, and you did not ask for
it?-I did not ask for it.


Lerwick, February 5, 1872, ALEXANDER GOODLAD, examined.

16,389. What are you?-I am a seaman, and I live in Lerwick.

16,390. I understand you wish to make some statement about the
sealing and whaling voyages?-Yes.  If I ask a half-pay note from
an agent, it cannot keep my family, and I am not much acquainted
with any person except the agent who will give me credit and
therefore I don't know where to get supplies for them in my
absence except through him.

16,391. What is the amount of your wages?-Usually 50s., and my
half-pay is usually 25s.

16,392. Do you commonly run an account with the agent?-Yes.

16,393. Is your reason for doing so that your halfpay is too
small?-Yes.

16,394. Did you ever try to get credit anywhere else except from
the agent who engaged you?-I have.

16,395. Were you refused?-Sometimes, but not always.

16,396. What reason was given for refusing you credit?-They
said they did not know me.

16,397. Was that by a merchant in Lerwick?-Yes.

16,398. Were you asked on these occasions whether you were
running an account elsewhere?-Yes; and I was told to go to the
agent's for what I wanted.

16,399. Do the tradesmen here expect that you will get your
supplies from the agent who engages you for the whaling
voyage?-Commonly they do.

16,400. And they don't care for giving credit to men who are
running an account with the agent?-No.

16,401. Were you running an account with the agent also at the
time when you applied for credit in that way?-No; I was clear
with the agent at that time.

16,402. Did you get no supplies from him at the beginning of the
voyage?-No; but I have sometimes got supplies from the agents
before I went on another voyage.

16,403. What merchant refused you credit in the way you have
mentioned?-It was some of them who did not know me in
Lerwick.

16,404. Did they refuse because they knew that the agent had the
command of your money, and could keep it for his own account if
he had one?-Yes.

16,405. Did they say so?-No, they did not make that statement
exactly; but they told me that when a man was getting a ship from
an agent he should go and get his things from him.

16,406. Did any merchant refuse to give you goods, and give you
that reason for his refusal?-Yes.

16,407. Was he an agent in the whaling trade?-No, he was not.

16,408. Had you an account at that time with any agent?-Yes.

16,409. I thought you said you had not?-I was done with the
agent, and had signed clear in his books.

16,410. What season of the year was that?-In February.

16,411. Do you engage then for the rising season?-I engage for it
in the month of March.

16,412. Do you then open an account with the agent for your
supplies?-Yes.

16,413. Then is it quite an understood thing that man who engages
with an agent for a Greenland voyage must get his supplies from
that agent's shop?-If his goods are as cheap and its good as any
other person's, they commonly take them from his shop; but if not,
they usually make a change with the first month's advance they
get, and buy what they want where they can get it cheapest and
best.

16,414. Did you ever do that?-Yes.

16,415. Do you always do it?-There are many things which the
agents do not keep, and therefore we have to go to different places
for what we want.

16,416. Do you get money from the agents for that purpose?-
Yes; we get our first month's advance on signing, and then they
will give us supplies in addition for two or three months I suppose,
or as much as we have a mind to take.

16,417. Have you ever been spoken to at the Custom House, when
you were getting your pay, about going down to the shop and
settling your account?-I commonly settle my account before I go
up to the Custom House.

16,418. But you don't pay your money until after you have been at
the Custom House?-No.

16,419. Have you ever been spoken to at the Custom House by the
agent, or his clerk, about going down to the office and paying the
money that was due?-Yes.  I was told last year by Mr. Leask's
clerk, Mr. Jamieson, to go down and pay the balance which I was
due.

[Page 415]

16,420. Did he tell you that in the Custom House or at the
office?-At the office, when we got our account of wages.

16,421. That was before you went up to get your money at all?-
Yes.

16,422. He told you then to come back with it?-Yes; and to pay
the balance due.

16,423. Is not that always done when you go to settle your
account?-No.

16,424. Is it not often done?-No; only that was the time anything
of the kind had been said to me.

16,425. Did you ever hear it said to anybody else?-No.

<Adjourned>.

LERWICK: TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 6,1872.

JOHN HARRISON, examined.

16,426. What are you?-I am a merchant in Lerwick.

16,427. Have you been for a long time a partner of the firm of
Harrison & Son?-Yes, since 1856.

16,428. I understand you have had large experience in the
management of the Faroe fishing business?-Yes.

16,429. Have you also had some experience with regard to the ling
fishing?-Not a great deal; but I have had some.

16,430. Has your firm had any connection with the management of
land or property in Shetland?-None whatever.

16,431. Have you neither been tacksmen nor proprietors?-My
father is a proprietor to a very small extent.

16,432. But you have not been in any way dependent for your
supplies of fishermen upon any interest or connection with
land?-In no way whatever.

16,433. Did you find the absence of that connection with land to
be any inconvenience to you in the management of your business,
with regard to getting fishermen?-None whatever; but men have
been hindered from engaging with us, in consequence of being
under the power of tacksmen or landlords, who wished to engage
them for themselves, although they would have preferred to have
gone into our service.

16,434. Has that occurred in many cases?-I cannot state the
number of cases, but it has occurred in many, and within recent
times.

16,435. Can you give an instance of that without mentioning
names?-I could not particularize the instances at the present
moment, but if I had time I am prepared to bring forward more
than a dozen instances within a period of between two and four
years back.

16,437. Are you now speaking with regard to your supply of Faroe
fishermen?-Yes.

16,437. Is it not the case, that where tenants are bound fish for
their landlord or tacksman, that obligation only applies to the ling
fishing if they engage in it but that they and their families are
quite free to go to the Faroe fishing or the whale fishing if they
please?-Under the system which obtains in Shetland, it makes no
difference what fishery a man may go to.  He is bound to do what
the landlord or the tacksman wishes; if not the result is merely the
service of a warning to the parents; and of course, in consequence
of the injury which that would do to them, the children, out of
their kindness to them, must submit to any rules which may be
laid down for their observance.

16,438. The evidence which has been led before me before, of
fishermen and of proprietors, has been to this effect, that the
obligation upon a man to fish for the proprietor or tacksman
extends only to the ling fishing, if he is engaged in it, and that if
he chooses to go to the Faroe fishing he is at perfect liberty to do
so?-I know of no such obligation.

16,439. Has your experience been different?-Entirely different.

16,440. Does your experience not apply to cases where the tenant
may have been in debt?-When the tenant is in debt, it is utterly
impossible for him to go and serve another man.  But I was
referring to the case of parties who were quite free of debt, and
who had money in their own possession.

16,441. How many of these cases have come within your
knowledge within the last two or three years?-I could not
particularize them.  There have been several cases which have
come under my own notice, or the notice of my firm, although
I could not state the number; but from hearsay, and from the talk
of men who are serving other owners, I am led to believe that a
very great number of these cases has occurred.  I do not mean to
say that there was actual straightforward force put upon the men;
but there were certain innuendoes, by which they knew perfectly
well that if they did not do as the tacksman or landlord wished, the
result would be that they would be warned out.

16,442. Can you mention the circumstances of any particular case
in which men have been prevented from going to the Faroe fishing
in any of your vessels?-I can particularize one instance which
came very vividly before me.  There were two brothers, who had
been with my firm since they were boys.  I had rather a respect for
them both, because they were honest men and capital fishermen.
One of the boys came to me and said, 'I find that I cannot go in
the vessel I wished to go in this year, because I am told by the
tacksman that my parents will be warned.  My brother can go; but
if he does, he will have to pay so much for the liberty of going in
the vessel that he wishes to go in.'  I had no reason to doubt the
correctness of that statement, because, notwithstanding his evident
anxiety to get into the vessel belonging to us, in which he wished
to go, and in which he had been serving before, he did not go in
her; and it was the evident pressure that had been put upon him
which hindered him from going.

16,443. Is that the most striking case of the kind that you have
come across in your business experience?-I cannot say that it is
the most striking case, but it is the case which appears at the
present moment most patent to me, because we were so directly
interested in it ourselves.

16,444. How long is it since that happened?-Three or four years
ago; I cannot say precisely.

16,445. Is that the only way in which your not having connection
with land has interfered with your business; or do you find it a
disadvantage with regard to the manning of your own vessels, not
to have landed property under your control?-No, I don't find that
to be a disadvantage; I find that we have been the most successful
owners of fishing vessels in the Faroe trade of any in the country;
and the reason is simply this, that the men who come to us are free
men-men who are not bound, neither will be bound, by tacksmen
or landlords but men who have been able to earn money by
superior energy; but we have had to do a great deal in order to
obtain such it class of men, and we have had to lose a great deal
of money which other people perhaps have put into their pockets.

16,446. Do you mean that you have lost it great deal of money in
order to secure this superior class of men?- Yes.

16,447. But has not the fact that you have procured them, proved
remunerative to you in the end?- [Page 416] Of course it has.  It
has been a gain to the men, and it has also been it gain to us.

16,448. Do you find that a man who is in debt is its good a
fisherman, in your experience, as one who keeps clear of debt?-
By no means.  My experience has been, on more than fifty
different occasions, that although men were due us from £5 to
£18 or £20, we would not engage them again if the captains of the
vessels said they were not fishermen who were worth being taken,
and would rather lose the balances against them in our books than
employ them.

16,449. Then you consider it an erroneous statement, that it is
advantageous for a merchant in Shetland to obtain a great number
of debtors?-I consider it to be the most erroneous statement that
ever was made.

16,450. You are aware, I suppose, that that statement was made in
the evidence of a witness who was examined in Edinburgh?-Yes,
I read something of that kind in the evidence; but I think it was
erroneous.  I suppose  Mr. Walker, when he made it, thoroughly
believed that the parties to whom he referred believed that having
a number of debtors was the best thing they could possibly have;
but my impression is quite different, because the fishermen who
are in debt do not have the same energy, nor do they exert
themselves so much in procuring fish as other men who are free.
If the fishcurer who had so many debtors had called them in and
said to them, 'Now men, I will strike off the balances against you,
and you will get no more supplies until you bring fish ashore,' I
have not the slightest doubt that at the end of the season the result
would have been it great gain to him, and a great gain to the
fishermen.

16,451. But you think that other parties in Shetland may have
acted upon the principle referred to in Mr. Walker's evidence,
although you do not approve of it?-They may have done so, and
I have no doubt they have, because it is a common axiom in
Shetland that if once you get a man into debt you have a hold over
him.  No doubt you have a hold over him, but it is simply a hold
over a very unwilling slave.

16,452. However, you have acted upon a different principle?-I
have always endeavoured to do so as much as possible.

16,453. And you think you have been justified in doing so by the
results?-Decidedly.

16,454. Can you give me any particular instance in which you
proved the superiority of men who were free from debt to those
who were in debt?-I can give general instances of that.  In an
island called Hildesha, belonging to my father, the men were
accustomed to cast their fish, as it is called, green, and to get
payment at so much per cwt. when they were landed green on
shore.  I found, after three or four years' experience, that at the
settlements the men were getting into debt, although they were
very good fishermen; indeed there were no better fishermen on the
west side of Shetland. When I asked them the reason they said,
'Will you give us liberty to cure and dry our fish, and to sell them
to you, or to Messrs. Garriock & Co., when they are dry?'  I said,
'Certainly, if you think that will better your condition.  Our house
is an exporter of fish to Spain, its well as Garriock & Co., and I
expect that you will not give them the fish at the same price which
we will give you for them, but that you will rather give us the
preference, seeing you are tenants of my father.'  The men said
that of course I should get the fish immediately they were dried,
and they thought that would be an advantage to them.  The result
of that was, that the men reaped a great benefit; and although some
of them afterwards, left the island in debt to the extent of £50, the
best of them are now free men, and have money of their own in
bank.

16,455. Is it long ago since that happened?-It is more than four or
five years since they left the island.

16,456. How long is it since they paid off their debts?-I think not
more than three years ago, some of them.

16,457. Was that not binding the tenants to deliver their fish to you
in the same way as proprietors do, whose method you disapprove
of?-Certainly not.  I stated distinctly that if they offered their fish
to Garriock & Co., and could get more money from them, then
they were at liberty to sell to them.  There was no stipulation
whatever to the effect that these men were to deliver their fish to
us.

16,458. Except that they were to give you the preference?-That
was not at all stated.  They simply gave us the preference, because
they had a notion-a very foolish notion-that we might have
acted in the same way as other parties would probably have acted
if they had not done so: that was, by giving them a warning and
turning them out of the island.

16,459. Did you not say that you stipulated with the men for that
preference?-No, I did not stipulate for it.  When I said to them
that I expected they would give us the preference I did so not in
the way of a threat, but, seeing that the men were tenants of ours,
and that they had no reason to be dissatisfied with any supplies
which they might receive, from our house during the time of the
fishing, I felt that they were right in giving us the fish.  I don't
deny, however, that there was a certain sort of coercion upon
them, from the very fact of my father being their landlord.

16,460 Have you considered the existing system in Shetland with
the view of suggesting a remedy for the grievances which are
alleged to exist?-I have thought it great deal over it, and our firm
has suffered a great deal in consequence of the existing state of
affairs, in the way I have already referred to; but certainly the
remedy one can hardly point out

16,461  What do you consider to be the principal evils which
exist?-The principal evil in Shetland arises from the system of
land tenure, whereby no man has a lease; or if he gets a lease and
if he is a fisherman, that lease is such that it is impossible for him
to continue to be a fisherman, and to prosecute the fishing with
energy.  It is those who have no leases who are so bound down that
they cannot do anything in the least degree contrary to the wish of
the landlord or tacksman.  I may give one instance of that, which is
rather ludicrous.  I was down at Sandwick parish the other day,
and I was very anxious to bring up some fowls to town if I could
get them to buy.  I sent a man round to see if he could get any for
me, but he called back saying that although I had offered about
twice the value for each of the fowls, he had found it quite
impossible to purchase them, as it was an agreement between
landlord and tenants, although the tenants had no leases whatever,
that they had to deliver so many fowls about the month of
February to the landlord.  I don't know whether the landlord gave
credit for these fowls and took the value of them off the rent; but
my impression is that it was something over and above the rent, as
a present for being allowed to sit without leases.

16,462. Was not that just part of the rent as kain was formerly
paid, and is now paid in some parts of Scotland?-I don't think
it was, because there is no account of rent in which that item is
marked down, so far as I know.

16,463. But I suppose the obligation to fish which is imposed
upon yearly tenants is the principal objection which you have to
the present system of landholding?-Decidedly.-

16,464. It what way does it operate injuriously this way: that
neither I, nor any man who has any amount of capital, can come
forward and by competition enable these fishermen to get a larger
price for their fish.

16,465. But the arrangement with these fishermen all cases is
stated to be, that they get the current price at the end of the
season.  Would that current price be any higher than it is now if
the tenantry of Shetland were not so bound?-I am speaking just
now of the benefit to the fishermen, not of the benefit to the
fishcurers.  I think the current price at the end of the year might
in many cases be less, even with greater competition, if the parties
bought the fish green from the fishermen, all the fishermen being
free, because several of them no doubt would be obliged to sell
their fish at an early period of the year when they might not obtain
a good price.  That would therefore bring down the market, and
the result would be that the fishermen [Page 417] in that way
would get less money if a current price were fixed then.  But with
regard to the benefit to the fishermen, I think that if there was a
system of cash payments the competition would ensure the highest
price to the fishermen; and of course the parties who bought would
have to take the risk, the same as every merchant does who buys
an article in every other trade in the world.

16,466. If you were introducing a system of cash payments, how
would you propose to work it in the ling fishing?-That is a very
difficult question to answer.  In the case of the ling fishing, as well
as in other fisheries, the only way would be to pay the men when
they came on shore, as the fish were weighed out of the boat.

16,467. Would you pay them the whole amount according to
a price fixed at the beginning of the season or at the time of
delivery?-At the time of delivery, not at the beginning of the
season.

16,468. Then that price would vary according to the state of the
market?-Yes.  If the price were fixed at the beginning of the
season, and if one boat or twenty beats fished to one man, the
result would be that that party would have the power over these
men, so that no other competitor could come forward, although the
markets might rise to the extent of from 1s. to 2s. 6d. per cwt.

16,469. Then you would not only have the price fixed at the time
of delivering the fish, but you would give up the existing practice
of engaging a boat's crew to fish for the whole of the season?-
Decidedly.  In the case of the ling fishing I would leave power to
the boat's crew to sell to whom they liked.

16,470. In that case would there be any choice but to deliver to any
fish-curer whose station happened to be most convenient for the
crew?-The distances in Shetland between the different stations
are sometimes very considerable, and of course a fisherman would
be obliged to deliver his fish to any party who had a station near
his house, if no other person came forward, but by the existing law
any person who wished to go into the trade could come forward
and erect a booth on the shore, and put up all the paraphernalia
necessary for the curing and drying of fish, no matter on whose
ground it might be.  There are plenty of beaches in Shetland; and if
the fishermen at a station came on shore and found that they could
get a higher price from any competitor who came forward, other
than the person who had a booth erected on that beach, they would
be quite entitled to sell their fish to that other party, who could
cure his fish on the beach, seeing that the party who held the beach
did not have any fish to cure on it himself, no matter to whom the
property belongs.

16,471. Is it not the practice in Shetland for proprietors to let their
beaches?-It has been the practice, but it is not legal.  The practice
has generally been to charge 1s. per ton for the curing of fish on
the beach; there is no such thing in Shetland as a beach let, but the
tenants or small crofters who want to eke out their incomes can
cure fish, or rather dry them, for themselves on paying perhaps 1s.
per ton to the landlord or to the tacksmaster, for the privilege of
drying the fish on the beaches below the crofts which they occupy.

16,472. Is it within your knowledge that 1s. per ton is generally
paid by every crofter who cures fish on the beach adjacent to his
holding?-That is quite within my knowledge, because our firm
have paid it to more than twenty small crofters who have been
drying fish for us, and they have then had to pay it to their landlord
or tacksman.

16,473. Do you mean that that charge has been made by the
crofters against you?-No, not made against us.

16,474. But they have made that charge, and you have agreed to
pay it as part of the price of their fish?-When I first went into the
trade 12s. per ton was paid for drying fish to the crofters to whom I
refer.  After a short time they complained about the 1s. per ton
for the use of the beaches and our firm then raised the price of
curing to 14s. per ton, which we paid, if I mistake not, for two or
three years when no other firm in Shetland paid it.  Now, as I
understand, other firms in Shetland are paying the same money,
14s. per ton for curing; but 12s. was the original price when I
entered into the trade.

16,475. Is that for drying also?-Yes.

16,476. If a price were fixed at the time of landing the fish, and
were paid in the way you mentioned, by one of several competing
purchasers, do you see any difficulty in the way of a fisherman
continuing to live and support himself, as an operative in any trade
has now to do?-There would be very great difficulty at first,
because the greater proportion of fishermen in Shetland are
dependent on the supplies which they receive from the fish-curer
to whom they fish.  At many times the weather is so bad that
they have not sufficient to live upon, and are obliged to go to the
fish-curer and ask him for the necessaries of life for themselves
and their families.

16,477. But in a time of slackness in the iron trade, or any other
trade the same difficulty might beset the operative?-Yes, he
might be in want of supplies.  I have no doubt that the operatives
in Lancashire and the manufacturing districts often suffer what our
Shetland fishermen have no conception of.  I thoroughly believe,
however, that any sufferings which they might be exposed to in the
first instance might be relieved in some way, which I cannot at
present suggest; but still afterwards their condition would be
greatly improved, because such a system would give them a great
deal more self-reliance, and the knowledge that they were simply
getting payment for what they delivered would make them more
independent and more energetic.  I believe the result would be a
greatly increased fishery in the islands, and the throwing over of
that serf spirit which exists at present among so many of the
tenants in the islands who fish.

16,478. Is it not the case that the Shetland fisherman has an
advantage over the operative in the south, in respect that he has
got a piece of land, which of itself is often sufficient to support
him and his family during the greater part of the year?-Generally
speaking, the crofts would do so.  It would be a very poor croft
indeed which would not support them for at least six months a
year.  In such a case the piece of ground must be very small, or at
all events it may be their own indolence which leads them not to
make the most of it; but in that way the Shetland fishermen have
a great advantage over the operatives in the town, who, if they do
not earn a day's wages, cannot get a single farthing's worth of
food, except from the charity of others.

16,479. But then it is said that the fishing is it more precarious
trade, and extends only over it period of the year in Shetland.
Does that not counterbalance any advantage which the fisherman
derives from having a croft?-It is true that the fishing is a
precarious trade, but we have always found that whenever the
weather permits, energetic men can make a very fair earning from
it.  Of course, when the weather does not permit, it is impossible
they can do anything except in the way of inshore fishing; but
unless the weather is very bad indeed, if a man will only try he will
get as much from that as will save his family from starvation.  I
think the advantage he has by his croft will compensate for any
disadvantage to which he is exposed by the occurrence of periods
of bad weather; and therefore I consider that his position is
infinitely superior to that of an operative in a time of strike or it
time of bad trade, when manufacturers are obliged to cast off their
hands from want of sufficient work to keep their mills or their
manufactories going.

16,480. Do you consider he would be better even if a system of
cash payments were introduced, and he did not fall back or
could not fall back upon the fish-curer when he was in want of
supplies?-I consider it would be much better.

16,481. Would a system of cash payments be an insuperable
obstacle in the way of a man of steady and respectable habits and
good repute, obtaining advances in provisions from any merchant
in his neighbourhood?-I believe it would help him very
considerably.  I consider that if it system of cash payments was
introduced, [Page 418] a man would find a great deal more facility
in getting goods at the lowest possible price from any person who
might wish to put up a store in his neighbourhood.

16,482. Are you aware that a great amount of apprehension exists
among fishermen in Shetland lest any change in the present system
involving payments in cash should deprive them of the support
which they derive from the fish-merchants in bad seasons?-I am
aware that that is a very prevalent idea among them, and several
instances of it have come under my notice during the last two or
three years.

16,483. Are you of opinion that that apprehension may have had
some effect in making the fishermen unwilling to come forward
and to give evidence freely before this Commission?-I have
not the slightest doubt that that has prevented men from coming
forward who would have been able to have given the best possible
evidence with regard to the questions you have asked me.

16,484. Are you now speaking from your knowledge of the people
and of the system for many years?-I am speaking from my
experience of the people and of the system, which experience has
extended over more than 20 years.

16,485. Would it be possible to introduce a system of cash
payments in this way, by allowing the fish to be paid for at the
current price at the end of the season, if the parties so agreed, and
arranging that at delivery a certain proportion of the price should
be paid in cash: for example, that three-fourths of the average
price for the last five years should be paid them, leaving the
remainder of the price to be paid according to the current price
as ascertained at the end of the season, thus giving the men the
benefit of any rise which might take place in the market by that
time?-I am afraid that if such a system were adopted, the party
who got the fish from the men even on one occasion, and paid
three-fourths or two-thirds of the value of the fish delivered
according to the contract price, would have such a power over
the men, that, even supposing a competitor came forward, say in
a month afterwards, to buy their fish, they would not be able to sell
to him although he offered a higher price, because the knowledge
that there was a balance standing in the hands of the merchant to
whom they had sold in the first instance would hinder them from
taking advantage of the increased price from the other, for fear
they might not be treated in the way in which they ought to be at
the settlement.

16,486. But the question which I put assumed that the engagement
of the fishermen was for the whole season?-I cannot see how in
that case it would alter the system.  It would remain the same as it
is at present, because, if the engagement was entered into for the
year, although there might be no contract or obligation on the
fishermen to take supplies from the man who bought their fish, yet
there would be a certain feeling on their part which would force
them, as it were, to go with their money which they had received
as part payment, and buy goods with it from his place.  Therefore
the merchant might have the same monopoly which he at present
enjoys.

16,487. But if the men had the cash, would that monopoly be in
any way injurious,-if you can call it a monopoly where the men
have the choice between two shops, and voluntarily prefer that of
the fish-curer?-Under the present system of land tenure it would
have no effect, because whoever the landlord favoured, if the
landlord was not a fish-curer himself, would of necessity have the
preference in the dealings of the fishermen, as they would know
that under the present system they are liable to get forty days'
warning and be turned out of their farms at Martinmas.

16,488. Do you mean that under the present system the fishermen
would consider themselves bound to deal at the shop of the
landowner or tacksman if he were engaged in fishing?-If a
system of money payments were adopted they might not consider
themselves bound to do so, but there would be so many petty
vexations put upon them, that the men, out of regard for their
own comfort, would decidedly give the preference to the
tacksmaster's or the landlord's shop, if he happened to be in the
trade, notwithstanding that they might have to pay a trifle more for
the goods which they got at his shop.

16,489. Then is it your opinion that, without altering the system of
land tenure in Shetland, a system of cash payments would be
unavailing to improve the condition of the people?-If no landlord
and no tacksman under a landlord was in the fishery trade, then
an improvement might be effected, but so long as landlords and
tacksmen-who have power over the land sometimes to a much
greater degree than the landlord himself can exercise-are
fish-curers themselves, it is impossible that a system of cash
payments can have any effect in ameliorating the condition of the
fishermen as it now exists.

16,490. In what way do you think it possible to modify the system
of long settlements now existing with regard to the Faroe
fishing?-The only way possible, seeing that the voyage to Faroe
extends to six or nine weeks on an average, would be, that when
the agreements are made out a contract should be entered into
between the owner and fishermen along with these agreements,
providing that they are to deliver their fish at a certain price per
ton weighed out on their arrival at a port in Shetland, whatever
port they may agree to deliver them at.

16,491. Then, in the case of the Faroe fishery, you would suggest
that the price should be known before the vessel sails, and not,
as you propose with regard to the ling fishery, at the time of
delivery?-No, I don't say that.  The difference is, that the owner
of a Faroe vessel, according to the present agreement, has the risk
of the vessel and of the outfit, and also of the salt and of materials
necessary for the prosecution of the fishery.  In most cases, indeed
in all cases, he requires to give advances to a certain extent to the
crew, say from at the lowest to £7 or £8 in other cases.  If he did
not have the power of getting the fish in his own hands, by having
a
contract from the men to deliver their fish to him at a certain
price rather than to others on their arrival after the first voyage the
men would have the power to deliver their fish perhaps to another
competitor, and the result would be, as is sometimes the case in
the Greenland trade at present, where the men are paid at the
Custom House, that his advances would not be paid to him at all.
The difference appears to me to consist in this, that the fish-curer
who gets the fish is the owner of the Faroe fishing vessel, whereas
in the ling fishing the men who fish in the boats are the owners of
them.  That, in my opinion, makes a great difference.

16,492. It is part of the agreement in the Faroe fishing that the
merchant should have delivery of all the fish, and that he is
entitled to it, because he is the partner of the men in all that
they take?-That it is the agreement

16,493. Then you think it would be possible, and perhaps
expedient, that a settlement should take place at the return of
the vessel from each voyage?-I believe most of the owners
would agree to that; but my impression, from the feeling which
I know to exist among the fishermen, is, that they would have a
notion that they were lying under a disadvantage by making a
contract before the fishing commenced.

16,494. Do you think the fishermen get any advantage in the Faroe
trade from having their fish paid for at the current price at the end
of the season?-They get a very considerable advantage in that
way.  We have been in the habit for several years of purchasing
fish from vessels owned by Englishmen, and manned by English
fishermen from Grimsby and Hull.  We pay them a certain price
per ton, cash down, when the fish are landed on the beach, and we
are supposed to make, and I may say that we do make, a profit
upon these fish when they are sold in a dried state.  Our fishermen,
generally speaking, get within a commission of the price that we
receive for these Englishmen's fish, which fish are quite as good
as our Shetland fish, and therefore they have the difference of the
profit which we make on the price we pay for the fish in a green or
wet state and the price that we receive when the fish are dried.

[Page 419]

16,495. Then, if the settlement were to take place at each landing
of the fish, in whatever way it was made, you think the men would
lose that advantage?-I don't say they would lose in all cases.  In
some cases they would gain.  We have often lost in buying fish in
that state, because the markets at the end of the season have fallen
so very heavily.

16,496. Would there be any objection, in your opinion, to bringing
the vessels employed in the Faroe trade under the regulations of
the Merchant Shipping Act applicable to foreign-going ships?-
There would be very great objection to that.  It would ruin the
fishery altogether if there was the slightest restriction upon the
vessel sailing at any moment: a great part of a fishing voyage
might be lost.  In my opinion, a delay of twenty-four hours has,
in many cases, hindered a crew of mine from gaining £100.

16,497. When a vessel comes in from her first Faroe voyage, how
long does she usually remain in harbour?-That depends very
much on the energy displayed by the men in getting the fish out
and getting on board their supplies of salt and other fishing
material requisite for the next voyage.  I know vessels which have
taken a week, and I know other vessels which have been off again
in forty-eight hours.  It cannot be done in less time than that.

16,498. I believe the vessels on their return don't always come
to Lerwick?-No; the most of them go to the west side,-to
Scalloway and the adjacent places in the islands.

16,499. So that it would be necessary to have a Custom House
officer in each of these places, if any such regulations were
adopted with regard to the Faroe smacks?-It would be necessary
to have a Custom House officer in at least eight different places in
Shetland.

16,500. Do you mean that there are eight places frequented by
these Faroe vessels where they are in the habit of landing their
cargoes?-There are eight places where the vessels go, no matter
at which place they land; but there are more than thirty or forty
different places in the islands at which they land their fish.  I am
simply referring to the places where the owners of the vessels live,
and where the vessels go in order to receive stores and salt after
the fish have been landed.

16,501. Then the fish may be landed at a different place altogether
from where the vessel has afterwards to receive her stores and
salt?-Yes.

16,502. But they do go to one of these eight places invariably
before starting on their second voyage?-Yes.

16,503. What are these eight places?-Voe, Vaila Sound, Skeld
Voe, Reawick, Bixter, Tresta, Whiteness, Scalloway, and Lerwick.

16,504. Do you think it is advantageous for the fishcurer, as a
matter of business, to have a shop for the supply of his fishermen;
and do you think that a system of short payments or of cash
payments would be consistent with the fish-curer remaining
also the keeper of a shop?-I don't consider that it would be
advantageous for a fish-curer to have a shop where there was
sufficient competition to cause him to sell at the low rates of profit
which obtain in all places where there is a proper amount of
competition, because he undertakes a risk which otherwise he
would not do.  He takes the risk of supplies to men who go to the
fishing, and who may come back without anything whatever.
Then, if he is not a landlord or tacksmaster, he knows perfectly
well that he has not power over these men to force them to serve
him for another year; and therefore I consider that if there was a
system of short payments, and if the fish-curer had no advances to
make to the men, he would be in a better position than at present,
if he is a man of capital, and was able to lie out of his money until
he could get the fish dried and prepared for market.  There is no
doubt that fish-curers in Shetland would require to have more
capital than they do have if a system of short payments were
adopted, because they get credit, perhaps for months, for the goods
supplied to the fishermen; whereas if they had to pay cash they
would be placed in quite a different position.

16,505. Do they get longer credit on their purchases of goods than
merchants in any other parts of the country in consideration of
them having to make these advances to fishermen?-I don't say
that they get longer credits, but they get sufficient credit perhaps
to enable them to get forward so much of their fish.  And even
suppose they wished a longer credit, they could, from the
creditor's knowledge that they had such fish in their possession,
obtain a renewal of their bills.

16,506. Are you aware that it is almost the invariable practice for
men employed by a fish-curer to take part of their supplies from
the shop of their employer?-That is the invariable practice.

16,507. Do you think the men in general have any option as to
whether they are to do so or not?  I am not speaking of your own
business merely, but of the trade generally throughout Shetland?-
In the case of men who are in debt they have no option whatever,
because other parties would not supply them, knowing that they
are bound to deliver the proceeds of their fishing to the fish-curer
for whom they fish.  But I must also say, that notwithstanding that
there are a great number of men who have plenty of money to pay
for their advances, whether it is from a knowledge that they can
obtain them at the same prices as they can from others, or from
carelessness to look after the matter, they generally take advances
to a small extent from the party for whom they are fishing.

16,508. You say that a man who is indebted has no option; but a
man who has no cash, although he may not be indebted, may be
equally without option, may he not, on the same grounds that you
have stated?-I should say that he has little option, unless he is a
man who is well known, and who has perhaps dealt with some
other shopkeeper or grocer previously, and paid him honestly.

16,509. Are you aware whether it is common for the fish-curer
to make advances in cash to fishermen during the course of the
season, with which they can go and purchase their goods where
they please?-I cannot say that, to my knowledge, money has been
advanced to fishermen during the course of the season in order that
they may purchase goods where they please.  I don't think that any
of the fishermen coming to ask for money would tell the fish-curer
from whom they were asking it for what reason it was being
required, unless it was to help to pay rent, or to buy meal or some
other necessary article for the house.

16,510. Could he not get the meal at the shop of the fish-curer?-
In some cases he may not be able to do so.

16,511. You say that fishermen frequently prefer to take advances
from their employer although they may have money of their
own?-I don't say that they prefer to take it; but I know in my
own experience, that, without any solicitation on the part of our
firm, men who have plenty of money always do take advances to a
certain extent.

16,512. Do you suppose they do that in order to save them from
drawing their own money from the bank?-I believe that is the
case.

16,513. Has it come within your observation whether a practice
of hoarding exists to a great extent in Shetland among the
fishermen?-I believe it does.

16,514. Even among men who appear upon the books of the
merchant with whom they deal to be in his debt to some extent?-
I have known several cases of men who have allowed balances to
stand over against them year after year, when I knew perfectly well
that they had more than sufficient money in their possession to
have paid off the debt.

16,515. How do you account for that?-I account for it in this way,
that the system has obtained so long of fishermen requiring
advances, or rather taking advances, that they cannot see or do not
understand, why they should take their own money in order to buy
the necessary supplies before they proceed to the fishing.  I have
no doubt that they have also this idea, that the fish-curer takes a
sufficient profit upon the goods supplied, and they consider they
have a right to keep [Page 420] their money and not to pay for
them until the end of the season.

16,516. Have you or your firm had any connection with the agency
for Greenland ships?-None whatever.  The only Greenland vessel
we ever had any connection with was a Dutch vessel, sent out by
an Amsterdam company last year, for the prosecution of the finner
whale fishing at Iceland.

16,517. Is there any additional observation you have to make?-
The only other observation I have to make is with regard to the
evidence given by Mr. Walker at Edinburgh last year relative to
the payments to fishermen and their earnings.  As the answers
which have been given by my firm in the circular sent in to you,
refer at least to one of the smallest years with respect to the men's
earnings, I should like to make a statement with regard to the gross
earnings, and the sums paid at settlement to the fishermen in the
previous year, that is, in 1870.  For 81 men and boys employed by
us that year, after all the supplies which they had received during
the season had been paid by them out of their earnings the average
payment to each was £23, 15s., and in many cases those who had
the greatest earnings did not take up more than one tenth part of
them in supplies during the course of the season.  Those men who
were free men, and who were not bound to fish in any direction
except where they wished, were the men who took up the least
advances.  I now exhibit a statement for the year 1870, proving
what I have stated.  It refers to six vessels.  The gross earnings
of the 81 men and boys in that year were £3022, 18s.; the total
amount paid in cash was £1923, 0s. 3d., or an average of £23, 15s.

16,518. You mentioned that certain men left your father's island
after having cleared off their debt: where did they go?-They went
to various other places; they entered chiefly into the Faroe fishing.

16,519. Did any of them return to fish for tacksmen, and deliver
their fish green as they had done formerly?-None of them.

16,520. Is it not the case that some of them went to Burra and
resumed fishing, and delivered their fish green to the tacksmen
there?-The father of the family went to Burra.

16,521. Did you refer to one family consisting of a father and
several sons?-Yes.

16,522. Did the father resume his old system of fishing Burra?-
Yes.

16,523. Why did he return to Burra?-Because the boys got
dissatisfied with the system under which they were fishing, and
the old man, of course, finding himself without the help of his
sons, could do nothing else than take a croft of land, and try to eke
out a living in the best way he could.

16,524. Then, although the men cleared off their debt in the way
you have described, by drying their own fish and selling them to
you in a dried state, the boys became dissatisfied with that system
of fishing?-They became dissatisfied with it, because it was not
sufficient to keep them.

16,525. Although it cleared off their debt?-No, they had not
cleared it off at the time they left.  They cleared it off in
consequence of going to the Faroe fishing or elsewhere.

16,526. Then the system of fishing that you refer to, and curing
their own fish, did not enable them to clear off their debt?-It did
not; but they might never have been in debt if they had been more
economical.

16,527. But you referred to that change in their mode of fishing, as
showing the effect produced by the difference in the green price
and the dry price for fish?-Yes; and if they had remained long
enough, I have no doubt they might have cleared off their debt as
well as others.

16,528. Then you think they did earn more under that system than
under the other system?-Yes.


Lerwick, February 6, 1872, WILLIAM ROBERTSON, examined.

16,529. Are you in the employment of Messrs. Hay & Co. in
Lerwick?-I am.

16,530. I believe you desire to give some further evidence on their
behalf, with regard to the mode of dealing with men engaged for
the seal and whale fishing?-Yes.

16,531. You have prepared a written statement, which you wish to
give in as part of your evidence?-Yes.

[The witness put in the following statement:-]

 'I am in the employment of Messrs. Hay & Co., and have been for
upwards of 28 years, during which time I have had the chief
management of their ship-agency business, and particularly
as to that part of it connected with the whale ships.  It was my part
to bring the men and the masters together, and attend to the
engagement of the crews.   The masters invariably chose the men
themselves and fixed their wages, and without any regard
whatever as to whether the men had any connection with my
employers or not, or might happen to be indebted to them.  The
masters generally selected first those men who had been with him
the previous voyage and that pleased him, and it was no
uncommon thing for men to go with the same master for many
years.  When the men were engaged they always had the option of
getting their first month's advance in cash, even before the recent
regulations of the Board of Trade; and if they wished it, they also
got allotment notes, but they seldom took the latter.  In the cases
where they did not take all their first month's advance in cash, it
was when they required a much larger advance in the shape of
warm clothing than the advance could obtain for them.  Men going
to Greenland require various articles that are not wanted by home
fishermen, and which have to be prepared for them specially.
Previous to the year 1867 a large proportion of the crews shipped
here were young lads from 16 years old and upwards, and the
wages from 15s. to 25s. per month.  A month's advance could
go but a small way in procuring the clothing necessary for such
a voyage, and an allotment note could not help them, because
sealing voyages were generally short, seldom exceeding two
months.  The agents had therefore to trust to their getting
oil-money and to their honesty in repaying the second year what
they could not pay the first.  Without such assistance these young
men could not go to Greenland; and the consequence of the recent
regulations of the Board of Trade having been to prevent them
getting the necessary clothing, few of them are now shipped.  Of
the four crews, consisting of 97 men, shipped by us in 1871, only
three lads were under 19 years of age; while in 1866, of the four
crews of 67 men, 19 were under that age.  Before 1867 I was able
to do the greater part of the work of engaging and settling with the
crews myself, but since then I have had to be assisted by one or
more of the other clerks in the establishment.  My employers, that
year, foreseeing the extra trouble that would arise from the new
regulations, and that the ship agency would interfere with their
ordinary business, arranged with the other agents to insist on
getting a higher rate of commission, add intimated to the owners
for whom they acted, that they would in future charge 5 per cent.
instead of 21/2.  They were induced to depart from this, because the
agreement was not adhered to by some of the other agents; but
they have continued in the trade with much reluctance, and chiefly
at my instigation, and from friendly feelings for certain of the
masters, for whose fathers and grandfathers even the firm had
acted.  In 1867, and since then, the men have always got their first
month's advance in cash at the Shipping Office; they have also
been paid in cash the balance owing to them at the end of the
voyage whenever they chose to ask it, irrespective of any advances
that had been made to them for clothing; but, as a rule they always
came promptly and voluntarily to pay their accounts when so
settled, and I am not aware of any case where they required to be
compelled to do so.  The men are very seldom in debt, and we do
our [Page 421] utmost to prevent their being so instead of
encouraging it, as has been stated in a report made to the Board
of Trade.  Whenever the ships came to Lerwick on their return
voyage, we always endeavoured to get the men to wait and be
discharged in a body, but even then could not always effect it; and
when they were landed at other parts of the islands we found it
quite impossible.  It is not true, so far as Hay & Co. are concerned,
that they ever took means to prevent the masters coming to
discharge their men at Lerwick.  On rare occasions, when the ships
have come in, and the masters have been anxious to get away
again without waiting to attend at the Shipping Office, I may have
written at their request a letter of excuse to the shipping master,
but certainly never advised them to go away.  It is quite true that
when I have paid off men before the shipping master, who had
accounts to settle, I have told them to go down to the office and I
would follow.  Once or twice men have offered to pay me at the
Shipping Office, and particularly on one occasion when a man had
a trifle to pay he offered it there, which seemed greatly to offend
the shipping master, who appeared to dislike the trouble of having
to take the men separately.  I have been told that a larger
proportion of advances in clothing is made to the Peterhead men
than to our people, and that such is charged in the masters'
accounts there, although not permitted here.'

16,532. You say in that statement, 'The masters invariably chose
the men themselves and fixed their wages, and without any regard
whatever as to whether the men had any connection with my
employers or not, or might happen to be indebted to them.  In
point of fact, were the men engaged by the masters not generally
indebted to the agent?-The masters knew nothing about that.

16,533. But were they not so in point of fact?-They were not, in
most cases.

16,534. Had they not arranged in most cases, before going on
board the ship or going before the master, to take part of their
outfit from your firm?-No; they came and asked that after they
had been engaged.

16,535. Did they not purchase their outfit until they had been
engaged?-No.

16,536. Had you many cases of men who were engaged by masters
through you purchasing their outfit from other shops?-I cannot
say.  Sometimes I believe that was the case; but of course I could
not know what they did in other shops.

16,537. Did all of them come to your shop for part of their outfit
at least?-Generally for part of it; but I have seen men who had
nothing from our shop except what are called mess things-things
which the men have to provide jointly.

16,538. I understand you collect the men and take them before the
captains?-Yes.

16,539. Do you make any selection of them before doing so?-No;
the captain selects his own men.  If the men are strange to the
captain, he may ask me if I could find a good man for him, and I
may do so, and have done it; but that is the only kind of selection
have made.

16,540. But before the men are taken before the captain at all, is
there no negotiation on your part as to the men who are to go?-
No.  If the man has gone in a ship before, he will come and tell me
that he wants to go again in that particular ship.

16,541. Do you present a list of the men to the master?-The
master generally has a list of his last year's hands, and if he likes
them he will take them again, or any part of them he chooses; and
if any of them are not suitable for him, he selects the rest from the
other men who come forward.

16,542. But do the men that the master selects all come up before
him without any list of their names being made beforehand?-He
generally has a list of his former crew there to look at.

16,543. Is there any list of the other men besides those of his
former crew?-No.

16,544. Are the names of the men wanting engagements not
entered in your books?-No.

16,545. Do you not keep a list of the men who come to you asking
to be engaged?-We never do that.  The men are always there, and
I just tell them to be at the place when the master comes, and then
he takes his own men.

16,546. But if a man comes in from the country or applies to you
for an engagement before the vessel arrives, would you not take a
note of that?-No.  I merely tell him to be there at the time, and
see if there vacant berth that will suit him.

16,547. Do you go up with him before the master?-He goes along
with the rest.

16,548. Do you, as acting for Messrs. Hay, ever refuse the
application of any man who comes wanting Perth?-We cannot
do so, because we always leave that to the master, who can take
any man he chooses.

16,549. Do you ever refuse to suggest a man to the master, or to
bring him before the master?-I never refused to do that, unless
he was a useless man that I knew was of no use.

16,550. Then you have refused to suggest a man in such a case?-
Yes; if a man was not a good hand, or the like of that, I would tell
the master so, and then he could take him or not as he chose.

16,551. But have you ever said to a man when he came applying
for a berth, 'I cannot take you,' or 'I won't take you, before the
captain?'-Not to my recollection.

16,552. Then a man might as well go to the master at once as
apply through you for an engagement?-The master comes to
the place to select his own men, and some of them go on board
and apply to him themselves.

16,553. If you make no selection at all beforehand, is there any use
for them applying to an agent?  Might the men not go to the master
at once and be selected by him, without your intervention at all?-
They might; but the master wants an agent to assist him in
collecting his men.

16,554. What assistance does the agent give him?-He helps him
in engaging them.  For instance, the articles are all filled up by
the agent, except the names, before going to the Custom House,
so as to facilitate business there.  Perhaps there may be a number
of ships lying here at one time, and there are a number of
arrangements to be made.  The agent carries through all that,
and the master has merely to attend at the Custom House and
see the thing completed.

16,555. That is to say, you give the master certain assistance after
he has selected the men?-After he has selected the men we take
down their names, their places of birth, and so on, and enter them
in the articles.

16,556. But before he selects the men the agent has done
nothing?-No further than that if a man comes wanting an
engagement, the agent will tell him that the master will be on
shore at a certain time, and the men are told to be there.

16,557. Is that the statement which is invariably made the men
applying for berths to you, without exception?-Yes, invariably;
except it is a man that I know is of no use and then I may tell him
that I can say nothing for him.

16,558. How many men out of 100 applicants might you say that
to?-Not many.  I never turn any away if the man chooses to go
and take his chance; but if I know that the man is not a suitable
hand, I tell him that he cannot expect me to recommend him.  But
there are very few men of that kind.

16,559. Do you remember any cases in 1871 in which you
intimated to the men that they were of no use, and that they
would not get a berth?-I don't recollect any.

16,560. Do you remember any particular cases of that kind in the
year previous?-I do not recollect any.

16,561. Have you ever intimated to any man who was owing you
an account that he was of no use, and would not get a berth?-No,
not to my knowledge.

16,562.  In what way do you know that a man is of [Page 422] no
use?-By being told by masters that he was of no use.

16,563. Have you a general knowledge of the men's abilities from
their reputation?-Yes, from what I hear from the sailors who
have gone in the same ship; or if the master has found them not to
be suitable hands, he tells me not to send them to him again.  But
there are very few instances of that kind; perhaps not one out of
100 or 200.

16,564. Was that the mode of selecting the men which was in use
five or six years ago?-They were all selected in the same way by
the master; he was always present.

16,565. But had not the agents more power in selecting the men
some time ago than they have exercised lately?-Not so far as we
were concerned.  I cannot speak for others.

16,566. When a man went to another agent for employment, being
in debt to Hay & Co., was it usual for that agent to enter the men's
debt to you in his books, in order to obtain a settlement of it for
you?-Not lately; but sometimes it has been done.

16,567. Was it done on the application of Messrs. Hay?-Yes.

16,568. Does the captain apply to you for some opinion as to the
qualifications of the men?-Yes, if he does not know them
himself.

16,569. You have told me that you have generally made yourself
pretty well acquainted with the men's abilities?-Yes.

16,570. Then I suppose only a certain proportion of each crew
shipped at Lerwick consists of men who have been in that
captain's employment previously, perhaps one third?-Sometimes
they had almost all been in the same ship before, but they changed
agents occasionally.  Perhaps sometimes one half of them might
re-ship.

16,571. But very often the captain would secure one half or one
third of new hands?-Yes.

16,572. In that case you must be consulted a good deal about the
qualifications of the men?-Yes.  I tell the master about them, so
far as I know; and in some cases, perhaps if he ships a man, that
man may be able to recommend another to him.

16,573. But I suppose the captain attaches considerable weight to
your recommendation?-Perhaps he does.

16,574. Have you any reason to doubt that he does?-I have not.  I
would not recommend a man if I did not know him to be a good
hand.

16,575. Has a captain ever refused to follow your recommendation
and to take a man whom you had recommended?-When he had
plenty of men of his own, of course he would take no others than
them.

16,576. But when he was in want of men, did he generally follow
your recommendation?-Sometimes I have seen him in doubt
between two or three men whom I have recommended, and he
selected any one of the three that he liked himself.

16,577. If you recommended one man in preference to another,
have you ever seen him take a man of whom you disapproved?-
In some instances I have seen him take a man who had been
recommended to him by another that he had engaged, instead of
a man that I could recommend.  The man had sailed with him
before, and he recommended another man with whom he was
acquainted, and the captain engaged him.

16,578. In that case he might suppose that the shipmate had a
more intimate knowledge of the man's abilities than you could
have from hearsay?-That is very likely.

16,579. But if there were no such influences as that, have you ever
known the captain refusing to follow your recommendation?-No.
If he asked me for good man, and I could bring him one and did it,
he took him.

16,580. Has any captain complained that you, or those acting for
Messrs. Hay & Co., had suggested men who were not preferable
on account of their abilities, but who were owing accounts, or
were likely to incur accounts to Messrs. Hay?-It is very seldom
that I had the chance of recommending men who were in debt to
us.  I never studied that in recommending a man to a master.

16,581. Was that because you had so few accounts with the
men?-We generally had accounts with them all when they
went out but there were a few that we had no accounts with.

16,582. Have you any doubt that the men were under the
impression or had an understanding that they ought to get their
supplies and their outfit, to a certain extent at least, from the
agent who engaged them?-They expect that the agent will
supply them.

16,583. But does the agent expect that they will give him their
custom?-There is no force in that case.

16,584. I am not saying there is force, but does the agent expect
that?-We must provide for it, whether they want it or not.

16,585. What must you provide?-We must provide clothing for
the men in case they want it.

16,586. But does the agent expect that the men whom he engages
for the Greenland whale fishing will come to him for their outfit,
or part of it?-Yes, because they had generally done so; but they
have never been forced to do so.

16,587. I am not saying that they are forced, but does the agent
expect that?-Of course he does, and he is prepared for it.

16,588. Do the men know that he expects that?-I daresay they do.

16,589. Was not that the principal consideration in inducing the
agents to undertake to carry on the agency?-I cannot say what it
was in former times, because there was an agency in the house
before my time, and I came into it after it was established.

16,590. But is it not the case that you are giving up the business
because the 21/2 per cent. commission is an insufficient
remuneration for your trouble?-Yes, it is insufficient for
the trouble we have; and I daresay if it had not been for the
circumstance that the present masters are sons and. grandsons
to masters who had been coming to the house long ago, we would
have given it up sooner.

16,591. Have accounts for outfit and supplies for men employed in
the Greenland fishing become less in recent years than they were
ten or a dozen years ago?-I daresay in some cases they have.

16,592. Is it not the case that they have done so upon the whole?-
Yes, because there are not so many green hands taken now as there
were then.

16,593. You have found it necessary to restrict your credits to
them?-On the short voyages we have.  A voyage of two months
is not like one of five or six months.

16,594. You have therefore lost part of the profit which formerly
accrued upon these agencies?-Of course if the outfits are less, the
profits must be less.

16,595. Is that the reason why you have found it necessary to give
up the business?-That is not the reason.  It is because of the
trouble we had with them.  I believe we have perhaps sold as much
to the men this year as we did when we had the agency.

16,596. Even when you had a great number of green hands?-
There are not many green hands going now, because the outfits
cannot be given to them.  That has been the experience of the last
few years.

16,597. But, apart from green hands, is not the amount of out-takes
by these men less than it was ten or fifteen years ago?-With some
men it is as much, and with others far less.

16,598. Do you think that upon the whole it is less?-I have not
looked into that, and I could not be sure about it.

16,599. Have you any general impression about that matter?-
When there were some green hands going of course they required
a larger outfit than they require now.

16,600. I am putting the green hands out of view altogether; I am
referring to the able seamen.  Do you think that their accounts
altogether are not less than they were formerly?-In some cases
they are.

16,601. Are they not less upon the average?-I daresay [Page 423]
they are, because men do not require so much now as they used to.

16,602. Is it not the case that you have been less willing to make
large advances to any class of seamen since the regulations of the
Board of Trade in 1867 or 1868?-We would give some men what
they required, and to others we would not.

16,603. Do you mean that to men you knew you would give what
they required?-Yes, but to strangers we would not.

16,604. Is that because your security in the case of strangers is
much less than it was formerly?-Yes.

16,605. Is not that one reason why you are giving it up?-No.
The chief reason is that the commission is small, and the trouble
is great.  We cannot get all the men together at one time for
settlement, or else it would be soon done.

16,606. But if you had the same returns from the men's accounts
which you had formerly, would not that be sufficient remuneration
for your trouble?-It would not.

16,607. Would you require larger accounts now than you had
before, even at the most flourishing time?-No, not larger
accounts; but we would require a better commission.

16,608. But larger accounts would serve the same purpose, would
they not?-I don't know.  We have so much trouble in bringing the
men together and getting them settled, that the commission is not
sufficient for it, and in fact our people wished to give it up in
1867.

16,609. In what respects is the trouble greater than it formerly
was?-Because the men don't come together, and we have
perhaps to go up with one and then with another, until we get
the whole crew discharged.

16,610. Do you mean that formerly you settled at your own
office?-Yes.  We did so before the Board of Trade regulations
were adopted, and we could take the men at any hour in the day
and settle their counts with them; but when we have to go to the
Custom House, we can only do that in the Custom House hours,
and that entails a great deal of extra time and trouble.

16,611. I suppose that in the case of each ship that may involve a
dozen visits to the Custom House?-Possibly it may; sometimes
more and sometimes less.  We try to get as many of the men
forward as possible when the ship arrives, if she comes to Lerwick.

16,612. Will each of these visits to the Custom House occupy an
hour?-I would not say that it would occupy an hour.

16,613. Could you do it in half an hour?-Possibly we might.

16,614. You would not have more than twenty visits to the Custom
House in the case of any ship?-I could not say the number.  I
have known sometimes that we had to go to the Custom House
with one man, and when we came down to the office we found
another man ready, and we had just to return again.

16,615. You say in your statement that you are not aware of any
case where the men required to be compelled to come forward and
pay their accounts?-No.  They have always come forward after
coming from the Custom House and paid their accounts.

16,616. I suppose the men understand that they are expected to pay
their accounts at that time?-Yes, when they get their money.

16,617. Is that the understanding upon which the advances are
made to them?-Yes, they know that.

16,618. What would be the consequence if they did not pay at that
time?-We would just have to take steps to get payment; that
would be the only consequence.

16,619. If a man declined to pay at that particular time, would you
have any objection to get him a berth next year?-We could not
refuse him, if the master chose to take him.

16,620. But would you help a man to get a berth if he was in debt
for the previous year?-I would not care much for that,

16,621. Could you not prevent him from getting access to the
captain along with the other men?-No.  The place is open for
any one to come in, and I could not prevent him.

16,622. But he would have to apply directly to the captain?-Yes,
he would have to apply to the captain for a berth; but they all do
that.

16,623. But I understand the captain only takes the men who are
secured by you?-No; I never said that.  The men come to the
place themselves, and they know the place as well as we do,
because it is always crowded with men, and the captain chooses
from among them, what men he wants.

16,624. Are there usually more men than berths?-Yes.

16,625. And I believe there is often a great crush to get into the
presence of the captain?-Yes, generally.

16,626. Do you tell me that a man who is in discredit with you,
and who has not your good word, or rather who is in your black
books, has any chance of getting a berth from a captain?-We
never had any experience of such a case, because the men have
always paid their accounts.

16,627. Don't you think they have done that under the
apprehension that they would not get a berth in the following
year, if they did not do so?-I don't know that.

16,628. Might not that be a reasonable explanation of the
punctuality with which they come down from the Custom
House and pay their accounts?-It might be, but I cannot say.
They never expressed anything of that kind to me and I have no
reason for thinking so.  The men whom we trust are honest men,
and we knew they would pay their accounts.  If we thought they
were not honest men, who would come down and pay their
accounts, we would not advance them.

16,629. Would you not give them advances in goods?-No.  We
always give them the first month's advance in cash.

16,630. But you would not advance them goods if you thought
they would not come direct from the Custom House and pay their
accounts?-No, not unless they came on their return.

16,631. Have you any doubt that if the master of the ship and the
agent concurred in telling the men to go up to the Custom House at
once, and have their accounts settled, the men would attend to that
direction?-I have done that myself.  I have asked the men on
board ship before they left it to remain in town until they were
discharged at the Custom House, and I could not get them to do so.

16,632. If you told them that you would decline to pay them
afterwards, would they not do so?-They knew we could not do
that.  I remember once making the remark to the shipping master
that the law should be imperative upon the men as well as upon
the master or agent; and unless that is done I believe the system
will never be other than it is.

16,633. When did you tell the men to remain in town until they
were discharged?-I have done that several times in late years.

16,634. Did you fix a day when they were to attend?-They know
that they should do so within twenty-four hours.  For instance if
they landed today, we would settle with them tomorrow.

16,635. Would you have any difficulty in doing that?-None.

16,636. Have you ever had any conversation with the men when
engaging them with regard to the outfit or supplies they wanted?-
Yes.  I have had such conversations with them in the shop after
they were engaged.  They generally go to the country after they are
engaged and come back again; there is a certain time allowed to
them.

16,637. Had you ever any such conversations with them before
they were engaged?-Not about supplies.

16,638. Or about outfit?-No.  We don't know what they want
until after they are engaged.

16,639. Have you not asked them what they wanted, in order to
know?-No.  I suppose they can hardly tell themselves until after
they begin to inquire.

16,640. But have you never had any conversation with them [Page
424] on the subject before engaging them?-We don't know
whether they would be engaged or not until after the engagement
was made.

16,641. Have you never had any conversation about what they
might want in the event of their being engaged?-I don't recollect
doing anything of that kind.  It is generally afterwards that any
conversation takes place about supplies.

16,642. I suppose, as a matter of course, there is some
conversation about that after the men are engaged: they always
want something?-When they come to town again before they
sail they must have some warm clothing, because men going in
that employment require warmer clothing than in any other
climate.

16,643. How long is it after the men are engaged before they come
back?-They may come back next day, or two days afterwards, or
any time the minister fixes for sailing.

16,644. Does the vessel usually lie in Lerwick for some days?-I
have sometimes seen her sail on the following day, or sometimes
two or three days afterwards.  The master fixes the time when the
men have to be on board, and they must all be in Lerwick, able to
go on board the same day.

16,645. So that in that case there is not much time to arrange about
outfit or supplies?-No; I have known men engaged on one day,
and go to sea the next.

16,646. Did you give any allotment notes?-We always paid them
in cash at the Shipping Office.

16,647. Did you generally give such notes?-Yes, on long
voyages, but on sealing voyages we did not.

16,648. Were these notes taken in name of the man's relations?-
Yes; of his wife, or father, or sister, or brother.

16,649. Were they not sometimes taken in the name of the agent
who was giving them supplies?-No; they were addressed to the
agent, to be paid by him.

16,650. But were they not also taken in the name of the agent or of
some of his clerks?-Not that I am aware of.

16,651. Was that never done by Hay & Co.?-Not to my
recollection.

16,652. Would you be surprised to learn that it had been done in
other houses in Lerwick?-It may have been done, but I cannot
tell.

16,653. In the conversations you have with the men about their
outfit or supplies, is it not usual to suggest what they should take,
and where they should get it?-No.  We ask them what they want;
but sometimes, if it is a man we are doubtful about, we refuse to
give him all that he asks.

16,654. But if it is a man you are not doubtful about, do you
always ask him what he wants?-We have done that, but he
knows what he wants without being asked, and he takes what is
necessary.

16,655. Is there any other person here who wishes to make any
further statement, or to tender additional evidence?-[No answer.]
Then I adjourn the sittings in this place.

KIRKWALL; THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 1872

THOMAS WILSON, examined.

16,656. I am a weaver in Kirkwall.  I was born in Fair Isle, and I
lived there till two years and nine months ago.  There are between
thirty and forty families in Fair Island.  They live chiefly by fishing
for cod, ling, and saith.  They fish chiefly in summer.  They have
always had to sell their fish to the proprietor, that being a
condition of their holding their farms.  Their farms are from four
to six acres in extent, with a right to the scattald.  I believe since I
left, they are not allowed to pasture their cattle on the scattald
without paying for it.  The island belonged, when I first remember,
to Mr. Stewart of Brough, in Orkney, whose tacksmen were first
Mr. William Strachan, Dundee, and afterwards John Hewison,
Westray.  Mr. Bruce bought the island about 1864.  I remember for
about fifteen or twenty years before 1864.  I am thirty-five years of
age.  The people had to sell all their fish to Mr. Strachan and Mr.
Hewison.  They were told so by them.  It was always the custom to
sell their fish to the tacksman, who also kept a shop for the sale of
goods.  There was always a shop, but sometimes no goods were in
it.  I have seen it without meal for more than ten days, and then the
people had no resource but fish, or milk, or anything they could
get.  That happened in summer.  In winter the people always had a
supply of meal of their own.  There are three or four water-mills
on the island, where the people grind their own meal.  They are the
old-fashioned little mills usual in Shetland.  When Mr. Bruce got
the property, the meal and goods generally became dearer than
they were before.  I don't think we have ever wanted meal
altogether since he bought the island.  We have had to send to
Sumburgh for it, but have generally got a supply before our meal
was quite done.  Sometimes, however, it has been very scarce.
When Strachan and Hewison had the island, any one might come
to the island to trade; and sometimes James Rendall, of Westray,
and sometimes James Smith, Cunningsburgh, came with boats
bringing goods and meal.  They sold about the same rates as
Hewison and Strachan.  The reason why we ran short was, that we
could not got notice sent.  The steamer did not use to stop for us
then, but now we get her to stop for a letter.  We have had to sell
the fish to Mr. John Bruce, jun. and to him only, since Mr. Stewart
sold the island.  The price of fish has been fixed by the man who
comes to settle, which is in June or July.  That settlement is for the
previous year, up to the 1st of May immediately preceding.  I have
seen them miss a year.  I have been told that Mr. Bruce has missed
a year since I came to Kirkwall.  There are very few pass-books.
The accounts are all read over to us.  We couldn't always
remember everything we had got.  I suppose we had just to take it
as it was.  The factor on the island read over the accounts, and he
handed a note of the total to Mr. Bruce and Mr. Irvine, who came
to settle with us.  We got cash if there was a balance in our favour,
but never in the course of the season.  We never asked for money
during the season; it was no use to ask for it, for we would not get
it.  I don't remember if any one ever asked for it.  We could
sometimes buy from Rendall, who is the only person that has come
to trade there since Mr. Bruce bought the island.  Since Mr. Bruce
came, he has not had liberty to trade; and he erected a stage on the
seashore, and people bought from him there.  Formerly he and
Smith carried on their trade in the house where they lodged.  I
suppose Mr. Bruce had forbidden that; at least all the people
understood so.  They used to lodge with Mrs. Thomas Wilson, near
the shore.  Rendall's prices were always a good deal lower than
the prices at the shop.  Their tea and sugar were cheaper.  Mr.
Bruce has tea at 11d., and I remember once at 15d. a quarter;
Rendall's was 10d. or 11d. sometimes, I think, as low as 9d.  There
was not very much difference in the tea.  Rendall always had sugar
at 6d., common grey sugar; Mr. Bruce's was regularly 7d.  I
remember [Page 425] Mr Bruce once had loaf sugar at 1d. per oz.,
or 14d. a lb., about 1867.  I don't remember his having loaf sugar
in the shop at all at any other time.  Rendall's sugar, I think, was
9d.  Cottons were bought cheaper from Rendall.  His were 10d or
11d., blue and white shirting: Mr Bruce's 1s., or once 16d.  The
prices did not vary much at Mr Bruce's store from year to year.  I
remember quite well the price of oatmeal in  Fair Isle during my
last year there.  I paid 30s. a boll.  I sometimes got the price when I
got it, sometimes only when I settled.  I think I knew the price that
year only when I settled.  The account was sent to me that year
after I had left, and 17s. of balance due to me was remitted.  I
know meal was that year 23s. or 24s. a boll in Kirkwall.  Mr
Alexander Gibson, merchant, told me so as I came down here.  I
have the account which was sent to me, in which the total amount
of the shop account is entered to my debit (£9, 13s. 4d.).  The entry
'By amount from the 'Lessing' account, £6, 17s. 9d.,' which is put
to my credit, means payment for lodging to workmen, and for
work done by myself at the wreck of the 'Lessing' on Fair Isle.
The owners or insurers, I suppose, were the employers of the men
who worked at the wreck; but the money came through Mr Bruce.
'By cash, left as a deposit, 11th May 1868, £3,' was money I was
fool enough to leave in Mr Bruce's hands at previous settlement at
his request.  I left it in his hands as my banker.  I can't remember
buying meal from Rendall on any particular occasion that I could
specify.  But I know I have bought it from him cheaper than I
could get it at the shop.  I got it from Rendall at 26s., and I am
quite sure, that during the 4 or 5 years I was on the island under
Mr Bruce, I never got meal at the store for less than 30s.  I
remember his (Rendall's) selling goods at night; but that was for
his own purposes:-to get his away as soon as he could.  I think I
have heard of him selling goods at night one time when Mr Bruce
and Mr Irvine were there, when they were asleep, but I can't give
any distinct statement about that.  In 1868, James Williamson,
Kirkwall had men working at the wreck of the 'Lessing,' which he
had bought.  His meal was cheaper than that at the store.  I had to
buy some of Williamson's as there was then none at the store.
That was in July.  I was employed by Mr. Wilson, the factor, in
quarrying for a store Mr. Bruce was building.  That was settled in
the account at the end of the year.  All work was so settled I have
already shown.  It is the entry 'By work with P. M'Gregor, at 1s a
day, 13s 7d.'

Six families left Fair Isle, and came to Kirkwall in 1869.  We all
left because meal was so dear, and wages were so low.  They all
left of their own accord.  I am sure they all left of their own
accord, and were not warned away by the landlord.  About
100 people left, in my remembrance, for America in 1862.
Government helped them.  There had been a great scarcity before
that.  In general, there is always a scarcity some part of the year.
They live mostly on tea, and porridge, and oatmeal cakes.  In
summer there is a little flour sometimes.  They get plenty of fish
generally in winter, chiefly by fishing from the rocks.  [Being
asked if he had anything more to say, depones:]  Only about the
beach fee in the account already shown.  I got only the £3 for the
whole half year I worked there.  I wrought 22 weeks and a half,
and I was to get 5s. a week; but he said because I left the work to
work at the 'Lessing' I should get no more.  I wrote about it to Mr.
Bruce, who wanted a detailed account of my work, which I gave
him; but I got no definite answer.  When Williamson was working
at the 'Lessing,' he was not allowed by the laird to employ men
Fair Isle.  The landlord or his factor said they would be put out if
they worked to him.  I was forbidden to work to him myself.  Mr.
Wilson and Mr. Irvine both forbade me to work to him.  I was told
I would have to leave the island if I did.  I was intending to go, and
did go, and am glad I goed [sic].  I have been far better off since I
left.  I have had better wages, better food, and less work since.
The other people from Fair Isle who are here, would say the same,
I believe.  I think Fair Isle people would be better off, if they had
liberty to buy and sell with any person they choose.


Kirkwall, February 8, 1872, MARY DUNCAN or QUIN, examined.

16,657. I live in Kirkwall.  I was born in Lerwick, and lived there
till 7 years ago.  I have knitted for 20 years all sorts of articles of
hosiery.  I knitted both with my own wool, and for the merchants.
I was always paid in goods.  I never got a penny in money.  I was
not much in need of it.  I often earned 9s. or 10s. in a week when
veils were dear; but generally less than that.  I knew many women
who depended entirely on knitting for a living; and they had to
take the goods and sell them for half-price, to any one who was
requiring them.  It was sometimes not easy to find people who
would buy.  They had just to ask among their friends if there was
any one who wanted the things they had.  I know James Coutts,
provision merchant, used to take the goods from knitters.  I knew
many people who gave them to him for tea and sugar, and
sometimes meal.  I have been in his shop when such transactions
were carried on.  I don't know if Robert Irvine dealt in that way.  I
know Betty Morrison.  I know that knitters disposed of their goods
to her.  I have seen her come to my mother's house with tea and
sugar for sale.  I knew they were from parties who had been
knitters to Mr. Linklater and other merchants.  She told us who the
tea was from, so that we knew quite well it had been got from
some one who had been knitting.  Sometimes, too, she would tell
who it belonged to.  We always got it cheaper than it had been sold
in the shop.  It was always dearer in these shops than in others,
sometimes 15d. a quarter, and we got it from Betty Morrison for
10d.  That was very common.  Jean Yates, and dozens of others,
hawked about goods got from knitters in the same way.  I had to
buy a great deal more dress than I needed, because I could get
nothing else for it.  Knitters have all plenty of clothes.  Some of
them I know have far more clothes than food.  I always sell my
knitting for money here.

[Shown veil got from Grace Slater, February 5.]  I would get
2s. 6d. in goods for that, when knitted with my own wool.  Seven
years ago, and 3 years ago, when I was home, 1s. or 1s. 4d. in
goods, according to the market, would have been paid at Lerwick
to one who knitted such a veil with merchant's wool.

[Shown veil from E. Malcomson, February 5.]  I would get 1s.
6d. for the veil, wool and all, here.


Kirkwall, February 8, 1872, THOMAS PEACE, examined.

16,658. I am a partner of the firm of Peace & Love, drapers,
Kirkwall.  I deal considerably in Shetland hosiery, mostly bought
in Shetland.  I get most from merchants, and a little from private
parties, knitters, who meet me at Lerwick.  I go there annually.  I
pay both in cash.  I don't get any cheaper, or very little cheaper,
from the knitters than from the merchants.  I have bought as cheap
from the shops as I can buy from knitters.  I have no means of
knowing whether merchants in Lerwick make any profit on the
hosiery.  I have been told I was getting goods in the shops at the
same price they were bought in at.  I never saw the goods bought
in.  I found knitters in Lerwick eager to sell to me rather than to
the merchants there.  They at first asked me 50 per cent. more than
I could buy the articles in the shops.  I told them they were for
sale.  I have had so much difficulty with them in fixing a price that
I now buy the most of my goods from the merchants.

I think a cash system would be much better for parties.  I don't
think it would affect my business as a [Page 426] purchaser from
the wholesale dealers in Lerwick.  I think it would be better for the
knitters if they got clear with the merchants.  I think most of them
are in debt to the merchant's shops.  Any system would be better
than running accounts from one year to another, and from the
beginning of one's life to the end.

KIRKWALL; FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 9 1872

Present-MR GUTHRIE.

LAURENCE WILSON, examined

16,659.  I am a fisherman in Kirkwall.  I was born and lived in Fair
Isle till April 1869.  I left because three of us were working at the
'Lessing's' wreck, and we heard we were warned for working at it
contrary to the master's (Mr Bruce's) orders, and we left that we
might not be warned.  There was nothing to do at the fishing at the
time worth waiting for, so I and they went to the work.  I
considered I was under no obligation to fish for him if I could
better my circumstance any other way.  I was only bound not to
fish for any other man than Mr Bruce;-not to fish to him while I
could get any other employment.  The others who left, did not
leave for that reason, but just to better their circumstances.  Prices
at Bruce's shop were higher than in Strachan's and Hewison's
time.  Prices were very much raised at the time of the American
War, when Mr Bruce got the island.  I think prices were higher in
Fair Isle than was necessary to cover the prices of carriage.  I have
no pass-book, for no pass-books were called for or used there.
[Produces account for 1868, obtained from Mr Bruce]  It was sent
to me after I left Fair Isle.  'By amount from boat's account, £4, 0s.
3d.;' that's the price of fish.  'By a quey, sold by auction at
Dunrossness cattle sale, 19s., less money and auction expenses, 5s.
6d.-13s. 6d.'  We were not allowed to sell our cattle to any one
but Mr Bruce.  The factor told us.  I never attempted to sell cattle
to any one else; but no doubt others did.  I left the island before the
time when Thomas Wilson wanted to sell his cow to Rendall for
£5, 10s.  If that was so, I think I could have got more for my quey
than 19s., but never was offered more.  Mr. Bruce did not settle for
the spring fishing when he came to Fair Isle in summer; but only
up to the end of the year.  I bought some meal from James Rendall
in summer.  It was cheaper than I got it at the same time from the
shop.  I can't tell exactly the price paid to Rendall that year; but I
remember well enough that the shop price was 30s. a boll.  I
bought from Rendall at 24s. in 1868, and Mr Bruce's price was
then 30s.  Rendall was also cheaper than the shop in 1867.  I got
from Rendall tea at 9d. and 10d., while the shop was 11d. and 13d.
I am not a very good judge of tea.  Rendall's sugar was 6d.
(common soft), shop sugar of the same quality being 7d.  Rendall's
loaf sugar was 8d.  I have never bought that sugar at the shop; but I
heard factor tell others it was 13d. a pound.  I had no particular
need of it at that price.  There was no difference in the price of
coffee.  Rendall's cottons were also cheaper, but I don't remember
the exact prices.  I always keep my own account, and could check
the account as it was read over to me by the factor.  When I lived
in the island I never got money till settlement, and never asked for
it, because it was usual.  Be
