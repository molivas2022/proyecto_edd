 of the priests, the Levites, were in all
        the cities of Judah, everyone in his inheritance.
011:021 But the Nethinim lived in Ophel:  and Ziha and Gishpa were
        over the Nethinim.
011:022 The overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son
        of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son
        of Mica, of the sons of Asaph, the singers, over the business
        of the house of God.
011:023 For there was a commandment from the king concerning them,
        and a settled provision for the singers, as every day required.
011:024 Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel, of the children of Zerah
        the son of Judah, was at the king's hand in all matters
        concerning the people.
011:025 As for the villages, with their fields, some of the children
        of Judah lived in Kiriath Arba and the towns of it, and in Dibon
        and the towns of it, and in Jekabzeel and the villages of it,
011:026 and in Jeshua, and in Moladah, and Beth Pelet,
011:027 and in Hazar Shual, and in Beersheba and the towns of it,
011:028 and in Ziklag, and in Meconah and in the towns of it,
011:029 and in En Rimmon, and in Zorah, and in Jarmuth,
011:030 Zanoah, Adullam, and their villages, Lachish and the fields of it,
        Azekah and the towns of it.  So they encamped from Beersheba
        to the valley of Hinnom.
011:031 The children of Benjamin also [lived] from Geba [onward],
        at Michmash and Aija, and at Bethel and the towns of it,
011:032 at Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah,
011:033 Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim,
011:034 Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat,
011:035 Lod, and Ono, the valley of craftsmen.
011:036 Of the Levites, certain divisions in Judah [were joined] to Benjamin.
012:001 Now these are the priests and the Levites who went up with Zerubbabel
        the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua:  Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,
012:002 Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,
012:003 Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,
012:004 Iddo, Ginnethoi, Abijah,
012:005 Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah,
012:006 Shemaiah, and Joiarib, Jedaiah.
012:007 Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah.  These were the chiefs of
        the priests and of their brothers in the days of Jeshua.
012:008 Moreover the Levites:  Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah,
        [and] Mattaniah, who was over the thanksgiving,
        he and his brothers.
012:009 Also Bakbukiah and Unno, their brothers, were over against them
        according to their offices.
012:010 Jeshua became the father of Joiakim, and Joiakim became the father
        of Eliashib, and Eliashib became the father of Joiada,
012:011 and Joiada became the father of Jonathan, and Jonathan became
        the father of Jaddua.
012:012 In the days of Joiakim were priests, heads of fathers'
        [houses]: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;
012:013 of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;
012:014 of Malluchi, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph;
012:015 of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai;
012:016 of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam;
012:017 of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Piltai;
012:018 of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan;
012:019 and of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi;
012:020 of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;
012:021 of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethanel.
012:022 As for the Levites, in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan,
        and Jaddua, there were recorded the heads of fathers' [houses];
        also the priests, in the reign of Darius the Persian.
012:023 The sons of Levi, heads of fathers' [houses], were written
        in the book of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan
        the son of Eliashib.
012:024 The chiefs of the Levites:  Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua
        the son of Kadmiel, with their brothers over against them,
        to praise and give thanks, according to the commandment
        of David the man of God, watch next to watch.
012:025 Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub,
        were porters keeping the watch at the storehouses of the gates.
012:026 These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua,
        the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor,
        and of Ezra the priest the scribe.
012:027 At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought
        the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem,
        to keep the dedication with gladness, both with giving thanks,
        and with singing, with cymbals, stringed instruments,
        and with harps.
012:028 The sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out
        of the plain round about Jerusalem, and from the villages
        of the Netophathites;
012:029 also from Beth Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth:
        for the singers had built them villages round about Jerusalem.
012:030 The priests and the Levites purified themselves; and they
        purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.
012:031 Then I brought up the princes of Judah on the wall, and appointed
        two great companies who gave thanks and went in procession.
        [One went] on the right hand on the wall toward the dung gate;
012:032 and after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah,
012:033 and Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,
012:034 Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,
012:035 and certain of the priests' sons with trumpets:
        Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah,
        the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur,
        the son of Asaph;
012:036 and his brothers, Shemaiah, and Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai,
        Nethanel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments
        of David the man of God; and Ezra the scribe was before them.
012:037 By the spring gate, and straight before them, they went up
        by the stairs of the city of David, at the ascent of the wall,
        above the house of David, even to the water gate eastward.
012:038 The other company of those who gave thanks went to meet them,
        and I after them, with the half of the people, on the wall,
        above the tower of the furnaces, even to the broad wall,
012:039 and above the gate of Ephraim, and by the old gate, and by the
        fish gate, and the tower of Hananel, and the tower of Hammeah,
        even to the sheep gate:  and they stood still in the gate
        of the guard.
012:040 So stood the two companies of those who gave thanks in the house
        of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me;
012:041 and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai,
        Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;
012:042 and Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan,
        and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer.  The singers sang loud,
        with Jezrahiah their overseer.
012:043 They offered great sacrifices that day, and rejoiced;
        for God had made them rejoice with great joy; and the women
        also and the children rejoiced:  so that the joy of Jerusalem
        was heard even afar off.
012:044 On that day were men appointed over the chambers for the treasures,
        for the wave offerings, for the first fruits, and for the tithes,
        to gather into them, according to the fields of the cities,
        the portions appointed by the law for the priests and Levites:
        for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites who waited.
012:045 They kept the charge of their God, and the charge of
        the purification, and [so did] the singers and the porters,
        according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.
012:046 For in the days of David and Asaph of old there was a chief
        of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.
012:047 All Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days
        of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters,
        as every day required:  and they set apart [that which was]
        for the Levites; and the Levites set apart [that which was]
        for the sons of Aaron.
013:001 On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience
        of the people; and therein was found written, that an Ammonite
        and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of God forever,
013:002 because they didn't meet the children of Israel with bread
        and with water, but hired Balaam against them, to curse them:
        however our God turned the curse into a blessing.
013:003 It came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they
        separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.
013:004 Now before this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over
        the chambers of the house of our God, being allied to Tobiah,
013:005 had prepared for him a great chamber, where before they laid
        the meal offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels,
        and the tithes of the grain, the new wine, and the oil,
        which were given by commandment to the Levites, and the singers,
        and the porters; and the wave offerings for the priests.
013:006 But in all this [time] I was not at Jerusalem; for in the two and
        thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went to the king:
        and after certain days asked I leave of the king,
013:007 and I came to Jerusalem, and understood the evil that Eliashib
        had done for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts
        of the house of God.
013:008 It grieved me sore:  therefore I cast forth all the household
        stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.
013:009 Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers:
        and there brought I again the vessels of the house of God,
        with the meal offerings and the frankincense.
013:010 I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them;
        so that the Levites and the singers, who did the work,
        were fled everyone to his field.
013:011 Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house
        of God forsaken?  I gathered them together, and set them
        in their place.
013:012 Then brought all Judah the tithe of the grain and the new wine
        and the oil to the treasuries.
013:013 I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest,
        and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah:  and next
        to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah;
        for they were counted faithful, and their business was to
        distribute to their brothers.
013:014 Remember me, my God, concerning this, and don't wipe out
        my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God,
        and for the observances of it.
013:015 In those days saw I in Judah some men treading winepresses on
        the Sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading donkeys [therewith];
        as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens,
        which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day:
        and I testified [against them] in the day in which they sold food.
013:016 There lived men of Tyre also therein, who brought in fish,
        and all manner of wares, and sold on the Sabbath to the children
        of Judah, and in Jerusalem.
013:017 Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them,
        What evil thing is this that you do, and profane the Sabbath day?
013:018 Didn't your fathers do thus, and did not our God bring all
        this evil on us, and on this city? yet you bring more wrath
        on Israel by profaning the Sabbath.
013:019 It came to pass that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark
        before the Sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut,
        and commanded that they should not be opened until after
        the Sabbath:  and some of my servants set I over the gates,
        that there should no burden be brought in on the Sabbath day.
013:020 So the merchants and sellers of all kind of wares lodged
        outside of Jerusalem once or twice.
013:021 Then I testified against them, and said to them, Why lodge you
        about the wall? if you do so again, I will lay hands on you.
        From that time forth came they no more on the Sabbath.
013:022 I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves,
        and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify
        the Sabbath day.  Remember to me, my God, this also, and spare
        me according to the greatness of your loving kindness.
013:023 In those days also saw I the Jews who had married women of Ashdod,
        of Ammon, [and] of Moab:
013:024 and their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod,
        and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according
        to the language of each people.
013:025 I contended with them, and cursed them, and struck certain
        of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear
        by God, [saying], You shall not give your daughters to their sons,
        nor take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves.
013:026 Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet
        among many nations was there no king like him, and he was
        beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel:
        nevertheless even him did foreign women cause to sin.
013:027 Shall we then listen to you to do all this great evil,
        to trespass against our God in marrying foreign women?
013:028 One of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest,
        was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite:  therefore I chased
        him from me.
013:029 Remember them, my God, because they have defiled the priesthood,
        and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.
013:030 Thus cleansed I them from all foreigners, and appointed charges
        for the priests and for the Levites, everyone in his work;
013:031 and for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the
        first fruits.  Remember me, my God, for good.

Book 17 Esther
001:001 Now it happened in the days of Ahasuerus (this is Ahasuerus
        who reigned from India even to Ethiopia, over one
        hundred twenty-seven provinces),
001:002 that in those days, when the King Ahasuerus sat on the throne
        of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,
001:003 in the third year of his reign, he made a feast for all his
        princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media,
        the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him.
001:004 He displayed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor
        of his excellent majesty many days, even one hundred eighty days.
001:005 When these days were fulfilled, the king made a seven day
        feast for all the people who were present in Shushan
        the palace, both great and small, in the court of the garden
        of the king's palace.
001:006 There were hangings of white, green, and blue material,
        fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings
        and marble pillars.  The couches were of gold and silver,
        on a pavement of red, white, yellow, and black marble.
001:007 They gave them drinks in golden vessels of various kinds,
        including royal wine in abundance, according to the bounty
        of the king.
001:008 In accordance with the law, the drinking was not compulsory;
        for so the king had instructed all the officials of his house,
        that they should do according to every man's pleasure.
001:009 Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal
        house which belonged to King Ahasuerus.
001:010 On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry
        with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha,
        and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcass, the seven eunuchs who served
        in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,
001:011 to bring Vashti the queen before the king with the royal crown,
        to show the people and the princes her beauty;
        for she was beautiful.
001:012 But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment
        by the eunuchs.  Therefore the king was very angry, and his
        anger burned in him.
001:013 Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times,
        (for it was the king's custom to consult those who knew
        law and judgment;
001:014 and the next to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish,
        Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media,
        who saw the king's face, and sat first in the kingdom),
001:015 "What shall we do to the queen Vashti according to law,
        because she has not done the bidding of the King Ahasuerus
        by the eunuchs?"
001:016 Memucan answered before the king and the princes,
        "Vashti the queen has not done wrong to just the king,
        but also to all the princes, and to all the people who are
        in all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus.
001:017 For this deed of the queen will become known to all women,
        causing them to show contempt for their husbands, when it
        is reported, 'King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen
        to be brought in before him, but she didn't come.'
001:018 Today, the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard
        of the queen's deed will tell all the king's princes.
        This will cause much contempt and wrath.
001:019 If it please the king, let a royal commandment go from him,
        and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes,
        so that it cannot be altered, that Vashti may never again
        come before King Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal
        estate to another who is better than she.
001:020 When the king's decree which he shall make is published
        throughout all his kingdom (for it is great), all the wives
        will give their husbands honor, both great and small."
001:021 This advice pleased the king and the princes, and the king
        did according to the word of Memucan:
001:022 for he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every
        province according to its writing, and to every people
        in their language, that every man should rule his own house,
        speaking in the language of his own people.
002:001 After these things, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus was pacified,
        he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was
        decreed against her.
002:002 Then the king's servants who served him said, "Let beautiful
        young virgins be sought for the king.
002:003 Let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom,
        that they may gather together all the beautiful young
        virgins to the citadel of Susa, to the women's house,
        to the custody of Hegai the king's eunuch, keeper of the women.
        Let cosmetics be given them;
002:004 and let the maiden who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti."
        The thing pleased the king, and he did so.
002:005 There was a certain Jew in the citadel of Susa, whose name
        was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son
        of Kish, a Benjamite,
002:006 who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives
        who had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah,
        whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.
002:007 He brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter;
        for she had neither father nor mother.  The maiden was fair
        and beautiful; and when her father and mother were dead,
        Mordecai took her for his own daughter.
002:008 So it happened, when the king's commandment and his decree
        was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together
        to the citadel of Susa, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther
        was taken into the king's house, to the custody of Hegai,
        keeper of the women.
002:009 The maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness from him.
        He quickly gave her cosmetics and her portions of food,
        and the seven choice maidens who were to be given her out
        of the king's house.  He moved her and her maidens to the best
        place in the women's house.
002:010 Esther had not made known her people nor her relatives,
        because Mordecai had instructed her that she should not
        make it known.
002:011 Mordecai walked every day in front of the court of the women's house,
        to find out how Esther did, and what would become of her.
002:012 Each young woman's turn came to go in to King Ahasuerus after
        her purification for twelve months (for so were the days of
        their purification accomplished, six months with oil of myrrh,
        and six months with sweet fragrances and with preparations
        for beautifying women).
002:013 The young woman then came to the king like this:  whatever she
        desired was given her to go with her out of the women's house
        to the king's house.
002:014 In the evening she went, and on the next day she returned
        into the second women's house, to the custody of Shaashgaz,
        the king's eunuch, who kept the concubines.  She came
        in to the king no more, unless the king delighted in her,
        and she was called by name.
002:015 Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle
        of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, came to go in to
        the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's eunuch,
        the keeper of the women, advised.  Esther obtained favor
        in the sight of all those who looked at her.
002:016 So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus into his royal house
        in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh
        year of his reign.
002:017 The king loved Esther more than all the women, and she obtained
        favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins;
        so that he set the royal crown on her head, and made her queen
        instead of Vashti.
002:018 Then the king made a great feast for all his princes and his servants,
        even Esther's feast; and he proclaimed a holiday in the provinces,
        and gave gifts according to the king's bounty.
002:019 When the virgins were gathered together the second time,
        Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate.
002:020 Esther had not yet made known her relatives nor her people,
        as Mordecai had charged her; for Esther obeyed Mordecai,
        like she did when she was brought up by him.
002:021 In those days, while Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate,
        two of the king's eunuchs, Bigthan and Teresh, who were doorkeepers,
        were angry, and sought to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus.
002:022 This thing became known to Mordecai, who informed Esther the queen;
        and Esther informed the king in Mordecai's name.
002:023 When this matter was investigated, and it was found to be so,
        they were both hanged on a tree; and it was written in the book
        of the chronicles in the king's presence.
003:001 After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son
        of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat
        above all the princes who were with him.
003:002 All the king's servants who were in the king's gate bowed down,
        and paid homage to Haman; for the king had so commanded
        concerning him.  But Mordecai didn't bow down or pay him homage.
003:003 Then the king's servants, who were in the king's gate,
        said to Mordecai, "Why do you disobey the king's commandment?"
003:004 Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily to him, and he didn't
        listen to them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai's
        reason would stand; for he had told them that he was a Jew.
003:005 When Haman saw that Mordecai didn't bow down, nor pay him homage,
        Haman was full of wrath.
003:006 But he scorned the thought of laying hands on Mordecai alone,
        for they had made known to him Mordecai's people.
        Therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews who were throughout
        the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the Mordecai's people.
003:007 In the first month, which is the month Nisan, in the twelfth
        year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot,
        before Haman from day to day, and from month to month,
        and chose the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.
003:008 Haman said to King Ahasuerus, "There is a certain people
        scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all
        the provinces of your kingdom, and their laws are different
        than other people's. They don't keep the king's laws.
        Therefore it is not for the king's profit to allow them to remain.
003:009 If it pleases the king, let it be written that they be destroyed;
        and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands
        of those who are in charge of the king's business, to bring
        it into the king's treasuries."
003:010 The king took his ring from his hand, and gave it to Haman
        the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.
003:011 The king said to Haman, "The silver is given to you,
        the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you."
003:012 Then the king's scribes were called in on the first month,
        on the thirteenth day of the month; and all that Haman commanded
        was written to the king's satraps, and to the governors who
        were over every province, and to the princes of every people,
        to every province according its writing, and to every people
        in their language.  It was written in the name of King Ahasuerus,
        and it was sealed with the king's ring.
003:013 Letters were sent by couriers into all the king's provinces,
        to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews,
        both young and old, little children and women, in one day,
        even on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is
        the month Adar, and to plunder their possessions.
003:014 A copy of the letter, that the decree should be given
        out in every province, was published to all the peoples,
        that they should be ready against that day.
003:015 The couriers went forth in haste by the king's commandment,
        and the decree was given out in the citadel of Susa.
        The king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of
        Shushan was perplexed.
004:001 Now when Mordecai found out all that was done, Mordecai tore
        his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out
        into the midst of the city, and wailed loudly and a bitterly.
004:002 He came even before the king's gate, for no one is allowed
        inside the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.
004:003 In every province, wherever the king's commandment and his
        decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting,
        and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
004:004 Esther's maidens and her eunuchs came and told her this,
        and the queen was exceedingly grieved.  She sent clothing
        to Mordecai, to replace his sackcloth; but he didn't receive it.
004:005 Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs,
        whom he had appointed to attend her, and commanded him to go
        to Mordecai, to find out what this was, and why it was.
004:006 So Hathach went out to Mordecai, to city square which was
        before the king's gate.
004:007 Mordecai told him of all that had happened to him, and the exact
        sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king's
        treasuries for the destruction of the Jews.
004:008 He also gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was
        given out in Shushan to destroy them, to show it to Esther,
        and to declare it to her, and to urge her to go in to the king,
        to make supplication to him, and to make request before him,
        for her people.
004:009 Hathach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
004:010 Then Esther spoke to Hathach, and gave him a message to Mordecai:
004:011 "All the king's servants, and the people of the king's provinces,
        know, that whoever, whether man or woman, comes to the king
        into the inner court without being called, there is one law
        for him, that he be put to death, except those to whom
        the king might hold out the golden scepter, that he may live.
        I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days."
004:012 They told to Mordecai Esther's words.
004:013 Then Mordecai asked them return answer to Esther, "Don't think
        to yourself that you will escape in the king's house any more
        than all the Jews.
004:014 For if you remain silent now, then relief and deliverance
        will come to the Jews from another place, but you and your
        father's house will perish.  Who knows if you haven't come
        to the kingdom for such a time as this?"
004:015 Then Esther asked them to answer Mordecai,
004:016 "Go, gather together all the Jews who are present in Shushan,
        and fast for me, and neither eat nor drink three days,
        night or day.  I and my maidens will also fast the same way.
        Then I will go in to the king, which is against the law;
        and if I perish, I perish."
004:017 So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther
        had commanded him.
005:001 Now it happened on the third day that Esther put on her
        royal clothing, and stood in the inner court of the king's house,
        next to the king's house.  The king sat on his royal throne
        in the royal house, next to the entrance of the house.
005:002 When the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court,
        she obtained favor in his sight; and the king held
        out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand.
        So Esther came near, and touched the top of the scepter.
005:003 Then the king asked her, "What would you like, queen Esther?  What is
        your request?  It shall be given you even to the half
        of the kingdom."
005:004 Esther said, "If it seems good to the king, let the king and Haman
        come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him."
005:005 Then the king said, "Bring Haman quickly, so that it may be done
        as Esther has said."  So the king and Haman came to the banquet
        that Esther had prepared.
005:006 The king said to Esther at the banquet of wine, "What is
        your petition?  It shall be granted you.  What is your request?
        Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed."
005:007 Then Esther answered and said, "My petition and my request is this.
005:008 If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please
        the king to grant my petition and to perform my request,
        let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I will prepare
        for them, and I will do tomorrow as the king has said."
005:009 Then Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart, but when
        Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he didn't stand up
        nor move for him, he was filled with wrath against Mordecai.
005:010 Nevertheless Haman restrained himself, and went home.
        There, he sent and called for his friends and Zeresh his wife.
005:011 Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches, the multitude
        of his children, all the things in which the king had promoted him,
        and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants
        of the king.
005:012 Haman also said, "Yes, Esther the queen let no man come in with
        the king to the banquet that she had prepared but myself;
        and tomorrow I am also invited by her together with the king.
005:013 Yet all this avails me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai
        the Jew sitting at the king's gate."
005:014 Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him,
        "Let a gallows be made fifty cubits high, and in the
        morning speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on it.
        Then go in merrily with the king to the banquet."
        This pleased Haman, so he had the gallows made.
006:001 On that night, the king couldn't sleep.  He commanded the book
        of records of the chronicles to be brought, and they were read
        to the king.
006:002 It was found written that Mordecai had told of Bigthana
        and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs, who were doorkeepers,
        who had tried to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus.
006:003 The king said, "What honor and dignity has been bestowed on
        Mordecai for this?"  Then the king's servants who attended
        him said, "Nothing has been done for him."
006:004 The king said, "Who is in the court?"  Now Haman had come into
        the outer court of the king's house, to speak to the king about
        hanging Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.
006:005 The king's servants said to him, "Behold, Haman stands in the court."
        The king said, "Let him come in."
006:006 So Haman came in.  The king said to him, "What shall
        be done to the man whom the king delights to honor?"
        Now Haman said in his heart, "Who would the king delight
        to honor more than myself?"
006:007 Haman said to the king, "For the man whom the king delights to honor,
006:008 let royal clothing be brought which the king uses to wear,
        and the horse that the king rides on, and on the head
        of which a crown royal is set.
006:009 Let the clothing and the horse be delivered to the hand
        of one of the king's most noble princes, that they may
        array the man whom the king delights to honor with them,
        and have him ride on horseback through the city square,
        and proclaim before him, 'Thus shall it be done to the man
        whom the king delights to honor!'"
006:010 Then the king said to Haman, "Hurry and take the clothing and
        the horse, as you have said, and do this for Mordecai the Jew,
        who sits at the king's gate.  Let nothing fail of all that
        you have spoken."
006:011 Then Haman took the clothing and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai,
        and had him ride through the city square, and proclaimed
        before him, "Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king
        delights to honor!"
006:012 Mordecai came back to the king's gate, but Haman hurried
        to his house, mourning and having his head covered.
006:013 Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything
        that had happened to him.  Then his wise men and Zeresh his wife
        said to him, "If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall,
        is of Jewish descent, you will not prevail against him,
        but you will surely fall before him."
006:014 While they were yet talking with him, the king's eunuchs came,
        and hurried to bring Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
007:001 So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.
007:002 The king said again to Esther on the second day at the banquet
        of wine, "What is your petition, queen Esther?  It shall
        be granted you.  What is your request?  Even to the half
        of the kingdom it shall be performed."
007:003 Then Esther the queen answered, "If I have found favor in your sight,
        O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me
        at my petition, and my people at my request.
007:004 For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain,
        and to perish.  But if we had been sold for bondservants
        and bondmaids, I would have held my peace, although the adversary
        could not have compensated for the king's loss."
007:005 Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen, "Who is he,
        and where is he who dared presume in his heart to do so?"
007:006 Esther said, "An adversary and an enemy, even this
        wicked Haman!"  Then Haman was afraid before the king
        and the queen.
007:007 The king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went
        into the palace garden.  Haman stood up to make request
        for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was
        evil determined against him by the king.
007:008 Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place
        of the banquet of wine; and Haman had fallen on the couch
        where Esther was.  Then the king said, "Will he even assault
        the queen in front of me in the house?"  As the word went
        out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.
007:009 Then Harbonah, one of the eunuchs who were with the king said,
        "Behold, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman has
        made for Mordecai, who spoke good for the king, is standing
        at Haman's house."  The king said, "Hang him on it!"
007:010 So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared
        for Mordecai.  Then was the king's wrath pacified.
008:001 On that day, King Ahasuerus gave the house of Haman, the Jews'
        enemy, to Esther the queen.  Mordecai came before the king;
        for Esther had told what he was to her.
008:002 The king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman,
        and gave it to Mordecai.  Esther set Mordecai over the
        house of Haman.
008:003 Esther spoke yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet,
        and begged him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman
        the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.
008:004 Then the king held out to Esther the golden scepter.
        So Esther arose, and stood before the king.
008:005 She said, "If it pleases the king, and if I have found favor
        in his sight, and the thing seem right to the king, and I am
        pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters
        devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote
        to destroy the Jews who are in all the king's provinces.
008:006 For how can I endure to see the evil that would come to my people?
        How can I endure to see the destruction of my relatives?"
008:007 Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen and to Mordecai
        the Jew, "See, I have given Esther the house of Haman,
        and him they have hanged on the gallows, because he laid
        his hand on the Jews.
008:008 Write also to the Jews, as it pleases you, in the king's name,
        and seal it with the king's ring; for the writing which is
        written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's ring,
        may not be reversed by any man."
008:009 Then the king's scribes were called at that time, in the third
        month Sivan, on the twenty-third day of the month;
        and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded
        to the Jews, and to the satraps, and the governors and
        princes of the provinces which are from India to Ethiopia,
        one hundred twenty-seven provinces, to every province according
        to its writing, and to every people in their language,
        and to the Jews in their writing, and in their language.
008:010 He wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, and sealed it with
        the king's ring, and sent letters by courier on horseback,
        riding on royal horses that were bread from swift steeds.
008:011 In those letters, the king granted the Jews who were in every
        city to gather themselves together, and to defend their life,
        to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all the power
        of the people and province that would assault them, their little
        ones and women, and to plunder their possessions,
008:012 on one day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth
        day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.
008:013 A copy of the letter, that the decree should be given
        out in every province, was published to all the peoples,
        that the Jews should be ready for that day to avenge themselves
        on their enemies.
008:014 So the couriers who rode on royal horses went out,
        hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment.
        The decree was given out in the citadel of Susa.
008:015 Mordecai went out of the presence of the king in royal
        clothing of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold,
        and with a robe of fine linen and purple; and the city of Susa
        shouted and was glad.
008:016 The Jews had light, gladness, joy, and honor.
008:017 In every province, and in every city, wherever the king's commandment
        and his decree came, the Jews had gladness, joy, a feast,
        and a good day.  Many from among the peoples of the land
        became Jews; for the fear of the Jews was fallen on them.
009:001 Now in the twelfth month, which is the month Adar,
        on the thirteenth day of the month, when the king's
        commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution,
        on the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to conquer them,
        (but it was turned out the opposite happened, that the Jews
        conquered those who hated them),
009:002 the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout
        all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus, to lay hands on
        those who wanted to harm them.  No one could withstand them,
        because the fear of them had fallen on all the people.
009:003 All the princes of the provinces, the satraps, the governors,
        and those who did the king's business helped the Jews,
        because the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them.
009:004 For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went
        out throughout all the provinces; for the man Mordecai grew
        greater and greater.
009:005 The Jews struck all their enemies with the stroke of the sword,
        and with slaughter and destruction, and did what they wanted
        to those who hated them.
009:006 In the citadel of Susa, the Jews killed and destroyed
        five hundred men.
009:007 They killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,
009:008 Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,
009:009 Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha,
009:010 the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jew's enemy,
        but they didn't lay their hand on the plunder.
009:011 On that day, the number of those who were slain in the citadel
        of Susa was brought before the king.
009:012 The king said to Esther the queen, "The Jews have slain
        and destroyed five hundred men in the citadel of Susa,
        including the ten sons of Haman; what then have they done in
        the rest of the king's provinces!  Now what is your petition?
        It shall be granted you.  What is your further request?
        It shall be done."
009:013 Then Esther said, "If it pleases the king, let it be granted
        to the Jews who are in Shushan to do tomorrow also according
        to this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged
        on the gallows."
009:014 The king commanded this to be done.  A decree was given out
        in Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons.
009:015 The Jews who were in Shushan gathered themselves together
        on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and killed
        three hundred men in Shushan; but they didn't lay their hand
        on the spoil.
009:016 The other Jews who were in the king's provinces gathered themselves
        together, defended their lives, had rest from their enemies,
        and killed seventy-five thousand of those who hated them;
        but they didn't lay their hand on the plunder.
009:017 This was done on the thirteenth day of the month Adar;
        and on the fourteenth day of that month they rested and made
        it a day of feasting and gladness.
009:018 But the Jews who were in Shushan assembled together on
        the thirteenth and on the fourteenth days of the month;
        and on the fifteenth day of that month, they rested,
        and made it a day of feasting and gladness.
009:019 Therefore the Jews of the villages, who live in the unwalled towns,
        make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness
        and feasting, a good day, and a day of sending presents
        of food to one another.
009:020 Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters to all the Jews
        who were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus,
        both near and far,
009:021 to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth and fifteenth
        days of the month Adar yearly,
009:022 as the days in which the Jews had rest from their enemies,
        and the month which was turned to them from sorrow to gladness,
        and from mourning into a good day; that they should make
        them days of feasting and gladness, and of sending presents
        of food to one another, and gifts to the needy.
009:023 The Jews accepted the custom that they had begun, as Mordecai
        had written to them;
009:024 because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy
        of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them,
        and had cast "Pur," that is the lot, to consume them,
        and to destroy them;
009:025 but when this became known to the king, he commanded by letters
        that his wicked device, which he had devised against the Jews,
        should return on his own head, and that he and his sons
        should be hanged on the gallows.
009:026 Therefore they called these days "Purim,{Purim is the Hebrew
        plural for pur, which means lot.}" from the word "Pur."
        Therefore because of all the words of this letter,
        and of that which they had seen concerning this matter,
        and that which had come to them,
009:027 the Jews established, and imposed on themselves, and on
        their descendants, and on all those who joined themselves
        to them, so that it should not fail, that they would keep
        these two days according to what was written, and according
        to its appointed time, every year;
009:028 and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout
        every generation, every family, every province, and every city;
        and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews,
        nor the memory of them perish from their seed.
009:029 Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai
        the Jew, wrote with all authority to confirm this second
        letter of Purim.
009:030 He sent letters to all the Jews, to the hundred twenty-seven
        provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of
        peace and truth,
009:031 to confirm these days of Purim in their appointed times,
        as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had decreed,
        and as they had imposed upon themselves and their descendants,
        in the matter of the fastings and their cry.
009:032 The commandment of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim;
        and it was written in the book.
010:001 King Ahasuerus laid a tribute on the land, and on the islands
        of the sea.
010:002 All the acts of his power and of his might, and the full account
        of the greatness of Mordecai, to which the king advanced him,
        aren't they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
        of Media and Persia?
010:003 For Mordecai the Jew was next to King Ahasuerus, and great among
        the Jews, and accepted by the multitude of his brothers,
        seeking the good of his people, and speaking peace to
        all his descendants.

Book 18 Job
001:001 There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job.
        That man was blameless and upright, and one who feared God,
        and turned away from evil.
001:002 There were born to him seven sons and three daughters.
001:003 His possessions also were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels,
        five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys,
        and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest
        of all the children of the east.
001:004 His sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on
        his birthday; and they sent and called for their three sisters
        to eat and to drink with them.
001:005 It was so, when the days of their feasting had run their course,
        that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning,
        and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all.
        For Job said, "It may be that my sons have sinned, and renounced
        God in their hearts."  Thus did Job continually.
001:006 Now it happened on the day when the God's sons came to present
        themselves before Yahweh, that Satan also came among them.
001:007 Yahweh said to Satan, "Where have you come from?"
        Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, "From going back and forth
        in the earth, and from walking up and down in it."
001:008 Yahweh said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant, Job?  For there
        is none like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man,
        one who fears God, and turns away from evil."
001:009 Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, "Does Job fear
        God for nothing?
001:010 Haven't you made a hedge around him, and around his house,
        and around all that he has, on every side?  You have blessed
        the work of his hands, and his substance is increased
        in the land.
001:011 But put forth your hand now, and touch all that he has,
        and he will renounce you to your face."
001:012 Yahweh said to Satan, "Behold, all that he has is in your power.
        Only on himself don't put forth your hand."  So Satan went
        forth from the presence of Yahweh.
001:013 It fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating
        and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house,
001:014 that there came a messenger to Job, and said, "The oxen
        were plowing, and the donkeys feeding beside them,
001:015 and the Sabeans attacked, and took them away.  Yes, they have
        killed the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone
        have escaped to tell you."
001:016 While he was still speaking, there also came another, and said,
        "The fire of God has fallen from the sky, and has burned up
        the sheep and the servants, and consumed them, and I alone
        have escaped to tell you."
001:017 While he was still speaking, there came also another, and said,
        "The Chaldeans made three bands, and swept down on the camels,
        and have taken them away, yes, and killed the servants with
        the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you."
001:018 While he was still speaking, there came also another, and said,
        "Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine
        in their eldest brother's house,
001:019 and behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and struck
        the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young men,
        and they are dead.  I alone have escaped to tell you."
001:020 Then Job arose, and tore his robe, and shaved his head,
        and fell down on the ground, and worshiped.
001:021 He said, "Naked I came out of my mother's womb, and naked shall
        I return there.  Yahweh gave, and Yahweh has taken away.
        Blessed be the name of Yahweh."
001:022 In all this, Job did not sin, nor charge God with wrongdoing.
002:001 Again it happened on the day when the God's sons came to present
        themselves before Yahweh, that Satan came also among them
        to present himself before Yahweh.
002:002 Yahweh said to Satan, "Where have you come from?"
        Satan answered Yahweh, and said, "From going back and forth
        in the earth, and from walking up and down in it."
002:003 Yahweh said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job?  For there
        is none like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man,
        one who fears God, and turns away from evil.  He still
        maintains his integrity, although you incited me against him,
        to ruin him without cause."
002:004 Satan answered Yahweh, and said, "Skin for skin.  Yes, all that
        a man has he will give for his life.
002:005 But put forth your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh,
        and he will renounce you to your face."
002:006 Yahweh said to Satan, "Behold, he is in your hand.
        Only spare his life."
002:007 So Satan went forth from the presence of Yahweh, and struck Job
        with painful sores from the sole of his foot to his head.
002:008 He took for himself a potsherd to scrape himself with,
        and he sat among the ashes.
002:009 Then his wife said to him, "Do you still maintain your integrity?
        Renounce God, and die."
002:010 But he said to her, "You speak as one of the foolish women
        would speak.  What?  Shall we receive good at the hand of God,
        and shall we not receive evil?"  In all this Job didn't sin
        with his lips.
002:011 Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil
        that had come on him, they each came from his own place:
        Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite,
        and they made an appointment together to come to sympathize
        with him and to comfort him.
002:012 When they lifted up their eyes from a distance, and didn't
        recognize him, they raised their voices, and wept;
        and they each tore his robe, and sprinkled dust on their heads
        toward the sky.
002:013 So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights,
        and none spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief
        was very great.
003:001 After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed the day of his birth.
003:002 Job answered:
003:003 "Let the day perish in which I was born, the night which said,
        'There is a boy conceived.'
003:004 Let that day be darkness.  Don't let God from above seek for it,
        neither let the light shine on it.
003:005 Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own.
        Let a cloud dwell on it.  Let all that makes black
        the day terrify it.
003:006 As for that night, let thick darkness seize on it.
        Let it not rejoice among the days of the year.
        Let it not come into the number of the months.
003:007 Behold, let that night be barren.  Let no joyful voice come therein.
003:008 Let them curse it who curse the day, who are ready to
        rouse up leviathan.
003:009 Let the stars of the twilight of it be dark.  Let it look
        for light, but have none, neither let it see the eyelids
        of the morning,
003:010 because it didn't shut up the doors of my mother's womb,
        nor did it hide trouble from my eyes.
003:011 "Why didn't I die from the womb?  Why didn't I give up the spirit
        when my mother bore me?
003:012 Why did the knees receive me?  Or why the breast,
        that I should suck?
003:013 For now should I have lain down and been quiet.
        I should have slept, then I would have been at rest,
003:014 with kings and counselors of the earth, who built up waste
        places for themselves;
003:015 or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver:
003:016 or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been, as infants
        who never saw light.
003:017 There the wicked cease from troubling.  There the weary
        are at rest.
003:018 There the prisoners are at ease together.  They don't hear
        the voice of the taskmaster.
003:019 The small and the great are there.  The servant is free
        from his master.
003:020 "Why is light given to him who is in misery, life to the
        bitter in soul,
003:021 Who long for death, but it doesn't come; and dig for it more
        than for hidden treasures,
003:022 who rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can
        find the grave?
003:023 Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, whom God
        has hedged in?
003:024 For my sighing comes before I eat.  My groanings are poured
        out like water.
003:025 For the thing which I fear comes on me, That which I am afraid
        of comes to me.
003:026 I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest;
        but trouble comes."
004:001 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,
004:002 "If someone ventures to talk with you, will you be grieved?
        But who can withhold himself from speaking?
004:003 Behold, you have instructed many, you have strengthened
        the weak hands.
004:004 Your words have supported him who was falling, You have made
        firm the feeble knees.
004:005 But now it is come to you, and you faint.  It touches you,
        and you are troubled.
004:006 Isn't your piety your confidence?  Isn't the integrity of your
        ways your hope?
004:007 "Remember, now, whoever perished, being innocent?
        Or where were the upright cut off?
004:008 According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity,
        and sow trouble, reap the same.
004:009 By the breath of God they perish.  By the blast of his anger
        are they consumed.
004:010 The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion,
        the teeth of the young lions, are broken.
004:011 The old lion perishes for lack of prey.  The cubs of the lioness
        are scattered abroad.
004:012 "Now a thing was secretly brought to me.  My ear received
        a whisper of it.
004:013 In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep
        falls on men,
004:014 fear came on me, and trembling, which made all my bones shake.
004:015 Then a spirit passed before my face.  The hair of my
        flesh stood up.
004:016 It stood still, but I couldn't discern its appearance.
        A form was before my eyes.  Silence, then I heard a voice, saying,
004:017 'Shall mortal man be more just than God?  Shall a man be more
        pure than his Maker?
004:018 Behold, he puts no trust in his servants.  He charges his
        angels with error.
004:019 How much more, those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation
        is in the dust, who are crushed before the moth!
004:020 Between morning and evening they are destroyed.
        They perish forever without any regarding it.
004:021 Isn't their tent cord plucked up within them?  They die,
        and that without wisdom.'
005:001 "Call now; is there any who will answer you?  To which of the holy
        ones will you turn?
005:002 For resentment kills the foolish man, and jealousy kills the simple.
005:003 I have seen the foolish taking root, but suddenly I
        cursed his habitation.
005:004 His children are far from safety.  They are crushed in the gate.
        Neither is there any to deliver them,
005:005 whose harvest the hungry eats up, and take it even out of the thorns.
        The snare gapes for their substance.
005:006 For affliction doesn't come forth from the dust, neither does
        trouble spring out of the ground;
005:007 but man is born to trouble, as the sparks fly upward.
005:008 "But as for me, I would seek God.  I would commit my cause to God,
005:009 who does great things that can't be fathomed, marvelous
        things without number;
005:010 who gives rain on the earth, and sends waters on the fields;
005:011 so that he sets up on high those who are low, those who mourn
        are exalted to safety.
005:012 He frustrates the devices of the crafty, So that their hands
        can't perform their enterprise.
005:013 He takes the wise in their own craftiness; the counsel
        of the cunning is carried headlong.
005:014 They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope at noonday
        as in the night.
005:015 But he saves from the sword of their mouth, even the needy
        from the hand of the mighty.
005:016 So the poor has hope, and injustice shuts her mouth.
005:017 "Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects.  Therefore do
        not despise the chastening of the Almighty.
005:018 For he wounds, and binds up.  He injures, and his hands make whole.
005:019 He will deliver you in six troubles; yes, in seven there shall
        no evil touch you.
005:020 In famine he will redeem you from death; in war, from the power
        of the sword.
005:021 You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, neither shall
        you be afraid of destruction when it comes.
005:022 At destruction and famine you shall laugh, neither shall you
        be afraid of the animals of the earth.
005:023 For you shall be in league with the stones of the field.
        The animals of the field shall be at peace with you.
005:024 You shall know that your tent is in peace.  You shall visit
        your fold, and shall miss nothing.
005:025 You shall know also that your seed shall be great, Your offspring
        as the grass of the earth.
005:026 You shall come to your grave in a full age, like a shock
        of grain comes in its season.
005:027 Look this, we have searched it, so it is.  Hear it, and know
        it for your good."
006:001 Then Job answered,
006:002 "Oh that my anguish were weighed, and all my calamity laid
        in the balances!
006:003 For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas,
        therefore have my words been rash.
006:004 For the arrows of the Almighty are within me.  My spirit
        drinks up their poison.  The terrors of God set themselves
        in array against me.
006:005 Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass?  Or does the ox
        low over his fodder?
006:006 Can that which has no flavor be eaten without salt?
        Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
006:007 My soul refuses to touch them.  They are as loathsome food to me.
006:008 "Oh that I might have my request, that God would grant the thing
        that I long for,
006:009 even that it would please God to crush me; that he would let
        loose his hand, and cut me off!
006:010 Be it still my consolation, yes, let me exult in pain that
        doesn't spare, that I have not denied the words of the Holy One.
006:011 What is my strength, that I should wait?  What is my end,
        that I should be patient?
006:012 Is my strength the strength of stones?  Or is my flesh of brass?
006:013 Isn't it that I have no help in me, That wisdom is driven
        quite from me?
006:014 "To him who is ready to faint, kindness should be shown from
        his friend; even to him who forsakes the fear of the Almighty.
006:015 My brothers have dealt deceitfully as a brook, as the channel
        of brooks that pass away;
006:016 Which are black by reason of the ice, in which the snow hides itself.
006:017 In the dry season, they vanish.  When it is hot, they are
        consumed out of their place.
006:018 The caravans that travel beside them turn aside.
        They go up into the waste, and perish.
006:019 The caravans of Tema looked.  The companies of Sheba
        waited for them.
006:020 They were distressed because they were confident.
        They came there, and were confounded.
006:021 For now you are nothing.  You see a terror, and are afraid.
006:022 Did I say, 'Give to me?' or, 'Offer a present for me
        from your substance?'
006:023 or, 'Deliver me from the adversary's hand?' or, 'Redeem me
        from the hand of the oppressors?'
006:024 "Teach me, and I will hold my peace.  Cause me to understand
        wherein I have erred.
006:025 How forcible are words of uprightness!  But your reproof,
        what does it reprove?
006:026 Do you intend to reprove words, seeing that the speeches
        of one who is desperate are as wind?
006:027 Yes, you would even cast lots for the fatherless, and make
        merchandise of your friend.
006:028 Now therefore be pleased to look at me, for surely I shall
        not lie to your face.
006:029 Please return.  Let there be no injustice.  Yes, return again.
        My cause is righteous.
006:030 Is there injustice on my tongue?  Can't my taste
        discern mischievous things?
007:001 "Isn't a man forced to labor on earth?  Aren't his days
        like the days of a hired hand?
007:002 As a servant who earnestly desires the shadow, as a hireling
        who looks for his wages,
007:003 so am I made to possess months of misery, wearisome nights
        are appointed to me.
007:004 When I lie down, I say, 'When shall I arise, and the night be gone?'
        I toss and turn until the dawning of the day.
007:005 My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust.
        My skin closes up, and breaks out afresh.
007:006 My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are
        spent without hope.
007:007 Oh remember that my life is a breath.  My eye shall no
        more see good.
007:008 The eye of him who sees me shall see me no more.
        Your eyes shall be on me, but I shall not be.
007:009 As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away, so he who goes
        down to Sheol shall come up no more.
007:010 He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place
        know him any more.
007:011 "Therefore I will not keep silent.  I will speak in the anguish
        of my spirit.  I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
007:012 Am I a sea, or a sea monster, that you put a guard over me?
007:013 When I say, 'My bed shall comfort me.  My couch shall
        ease my complaint;'
007:014 then you scare me with dreams, and terrify me through visions:
007:015 so that my soul chooses strangling, death rather than my bones.
007:016 I loathe my life.  I don't want to live forever.
        Leave me alone, for my days are but a breath.
007:017 What is man, that you should magnify him, that you should set
        your mind on him,
007:018 that you should visit him every morning, and test him every moment?
007:019 How long will you not look away from me, nor leave me alone
        until I swallow down my spittle?
007:020 If I have sinned, what do I do to you, you watcher of men?
        Why have you set me as a mark for you, so that I am
        a burden to myself?
007:021 Why do you not pardon my disobedience, and take away my iniquity?
        For now shall I lie down in the dust.  You will seek me diligently,
        but I shall not be."
008:001 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,
008:002 "How long will you speak these things?  Shall the words of your
        mouth be a mighty wind?
008:003 Does God pervert justice?  Or does the Almighty
        pervert righteousness?
008:004 If your children have sinned against him, He has delivered
        them into the hand of their disobedience.
008:005 If you want to seek God diligently, make your supplication
        to the Almighty.
008:006 If you were pure and upright, surely now he would awaken for you,
        and make the habitation of your righteousness prosperous.
008:007 Though your beginning was small, yet your latter end
        would greatly increase.
008:008 "Please inquire of past generations.  Find out about the learning
        of their fathers.
008:009 (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our
        days on earth are a shadow.)
008:010 Shall they not teach you, tell you, and utter words out
        of their heart?
008:011 "Can the papyrus grow up without mire?  Can the rushes
        grow without water?
008:012 While it is yet in its greenness, not cut down, it withers
        before any other reed.
008:013 So are the paths of all who forget God.  The hope of the godless
        man shall perish,
008:014 Whose confidence shall break apart, Whose trust is a spider's web.
008:015 He shall lean on his house, but it shall not stand.
        He shall cling to it, but it shall not endure.
008:016 He is green before the sun.  His shoots go forth over his garden.
008:017 His roots are wrapped around the rock pile.  He sees
        the place of stones.
008:018 If he is destroyed from his place, then it shall deny him,
        saying, 'I have not seen you.'
008:019 Behold, this is the joy of his way:  out of the earth,
        others shall spring.
008:020 "Behold, God will not cast away a blameless man, neither will
        he uphold the evil-doers.
008:021 He will still fill your mouth with laughter, your lips with shouting.
008:022 Those who hate you shall be clothed with shame.
        The tent of the wicked shall be no more."
009:001 Then Job answered,
009:002 "Truly I know that it is so, but how can man be just with God?
009:003 If he is pleased to contend with him, he can't answer him
        one time in a thousand.
009:004 God who is wise in heart, and mighty in strength:
        who has hardened himself against him, and prospered?
009:005 He removes the mountains, and they don't know it, when he overturns
        them in his anger.
009:006 He shakes the earth out of its place.  Its pillars tremble.
009:007 He commands the sun, and it doesn't rise, and seals up the stars.
009:008 He alone stretches out the heavens, and treads on the waves
        of the sea.
009:009 He makes the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, and the chambers
        of the south.
009:010 He does great things past finding out; yes, marvelous
        things without number.
009:011 Behold, he goes by me, and I don't see him.  He passes on also,
        but I don't perceive him.
009:012 Behold, he snatches away.  Who can hinder him?  Who will ask him,
        'What are you doing?'
009:013 "God will not withdraw his anger.  The helpers of Rahab
        stoop under him.
009:014 How much less shall I answer him, And choose my words to
        argue with him?
009:015 Though I were righteous, yet I wouldn't answer him.
        I would make supplication to my judge.
009:016 If I had called, and he had answered me, yet I wouldn't believe
        that he listened to my voice.
009:017 For he breaks me with a storm, and multiplies my
        wounds without cause.
009:018 He will not allow me to catch my breath, but fills
        me with bitterness.
009:019 If it is a matter of strength, behold, he is mighty!
        If of justice, 'Who,' says he, 'will summon me?'
009:020 Though I am righteous, my own mouth shall condemn me.
        Though I am blameless, it shall prove me perverse.
009:021 I am blameless.  I don't regard myself.  I despise my life.
009:022 "It is all the same.  Therefore I say he destroys the blameless
        and the wicked.
009:023 If the scourge kills suddenly, he will mock at the trial
        of the innocent.
009:024 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked.
        He covers the faces of the judges of it.  If not he,
        then who is it?
009:025 "Now my days are swifter than a runner.  They flee away,
        they see no good,
009:026 They have passed away as the swift ships, as the eagle that
        swoops on the prey.
009:027 If I say, 'I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad face,
        and cheer up;'
009:028 I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that you will not
        hold me innocent.
009:029 I shall be condemned.  Why then do I labor in vain?
009:030 If I wash myself with snow, and cleanse my hands with lye,
009:031 yet you will plunge me in the ditch.  My own clothes
        shall abhor me.
009:032 For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him,
        that we should come together in judgment.
009:033 There is no umpire between us, that might lay his hand
        on us both.
009:034 Let him take his rod away from me.  Let his terror not
        make me afraid;
009:035 then I would speak, and not fear him, for I am not so in myself.
010:001 "My soul is weary of my life.  I will give free course to
        my complaint.  I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
010:002 I will tell God, 'Do not condemn me.  Show me why you
        contend with me.
010:003 Is it good to you that you should oppress, that you should
        despise the work of your hands, and smile on the counsel
        of the wicked?
010:004 Do you have eyes of flesh?  Or do you see as man sees?
010:005 Are your days as the days of mortals, or your years as man's years,
010:006 that you inquire after my iniquity, and search after my sin?
010:007 Although you know that I am not wicked, there is no one who can
        deliver out of your hand.
010:008 "'Your hands have framed me and fashioned me altogether,
        yet you destroy me.
010:009 Remember, I beg you, that you have fashioned me as clay.
        Will you bring me into dust again?
010:010 Haven't you poured me out like milk, and curdled me like cheese?
010:011 You have clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together
        with bones and sinews.
010:012 You have granted me life and loving kindness.  Your visitation
        has preserved my spirit.
010:013 Yet you hid these things in your heart.  I know that this
        is with you:
010:014 if I sin, then you mark me.  You will not acquit me
        from my iniquity.
010:015 If I am wicked, woe to me.  If I am righteous, I still shall
        not lift up my head, being filled with disgrace, and conscious
        of my affliction.
010:016 If my head is held high, you hunt me like a lion.
        Again you show yourself powerful to me.
010:017 You renew your witnesses against me, and increase your indignation
        on me.  Changes and warfare are with me.
010:018 "'Why, then, have you brought me forth out of the womb?
        I wish I had given up the spirit, and no eye had seen me.
010:019 I should have been as though I had not been.  I should have
        been carried from the womb to the grave.
010:020 Aren't my days few?  Cease then.  Leave me alone, that I may
        find a little comfort,
010:021 before I go where I shall not return from, to the land
        of darkness and of the shadow of death;
010:022 the land dark as midnight, of the shadow of death, without any order,
        where the light is as midnight.'"
011:001 Then Zophar, the Naamathite, answered,
011:002 "Shouldn't the multitude of words be answered?  Should a man
        full of talk be justified?
011:003 Should your boastings make men hold their peace?
        When you mock, shall no man make you ashamed?
011:004 For you say, 'My doctrine is pure.  I am clean in your eyes.'
011:005 But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against you,
011:006 that he would show you the secrets of wisdom!  For true wisdom
        has two sides.  Know therefore that God exacts of you less
        than your iniquity deserves.
011:007 "Can you fathom the mystery of God?  Or can you probe the limits
        of the Almighty?
011:008 They are high as heaven.  What can you do?  They are deeper
        than Sheol.  What can you know?
011:009 Its measure is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.
011:010 If he passes by, or confines, or convenes a court, then who
        can oppose him?
011:011 For he knows false men.  He sees iniquity also, even though
        he doesn't consider it.
011:012 An empty-headed man becomes wise when a man is born as a
        wild donkey's colt.
011:013 "If you set your heart aright, stretch out your hands toward him.
011:014 If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away.  Don't let
        unrighteousness dwell in your tents.
011:015 Surely then shall you lift up your face without spot;
        Yes, you shall be steadfast, and shall not fear:
011:016 for you shall forget your misery.  You shall remember it
        as waters that are passed away.
011:017 Life shall be clearer than the noonday.  Though there is darkness,
        it shall be as the morning.
011:018 You shall be secure, because there is hope.  Yes, you shall search,
        and shall take your rest in safety.
011:019 Also you shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid.
        Yes, many shall court your favor.
011:020 But the eyes of the wicked shall fail.  They shall have no way
        to flee.  Their hope shall be the giving up of the spirit."
012:001 Then Job answered,
012:002 "No doubt, but you are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.
012:003 But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you.
        Yes, who doesn't know such things as these?
012:004 I am like one who is a joke to his neighbor, I, who called on God,
        and he answered.  The just, the blameless man is a joke.
012:005 In the thought of him who is at ease there is contempt
        for misfortune.  It is ready for them whose foot slips.
012:006 The tents of robbers prosper.  Those who provoke God are secure,
        who carry their God in their hands.
012:007 "But ask the animals, now, and they shall teach you;
        the birds of the sky, and they shall tell you.
012:008 Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach you.  The fish
        of the sea shall declare to you.
012:009 Who doesn't know that in all these, the hand of Yahweh
        has done this,
012:010 in whose hand is the life of every living thing, and the breath
        of all mankind?
012:011 Doesn't the ear try words, even as the palate tastes its food?
012:012 With aged men is wisdom, in length of days understanding.
012:013 "With God is wisdom and might.  He has counsel and understanding.
012:014 Behold, he breaks down, and it can't be built again.
        He imprisons a man, and there can be no release.
012:015 Behold, he withholds the waters, and they dry up.  Again, he sends
        them out, and they overturn the earth.
012:016 With him is strength and wisdom.  The deceived and the
        deceiver are his.
012:017 He leads counselors away stripped.  He makes judges fools.
012:018 He loosens the bond of kings.  He binds their waist with a belt.
012:019 He leads priests away stripped, and overthrows the mighty.
012:020 He removes the speech of those who are trusted, and takes away
        the understanding of the elders.
012:021 He pours contempt on princes, and loosens the belt of the strong.
012:022 He uncovers deep things out of darkness, and brings out to light
        the shadow of death.
012:023 He increases the nations, and he destroys them.
        He enlarges the nations, and he leads them captive.
012:024 He takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people
        of the earth, and causes them to wander in a wilderness
        where there is no way.
012:025 They grope in the dark without light.  He makes them stagger
        like a drunken man.
013:001 "Behold, my eye has seen all this.  My ear has heard
        and understood it.
013:002 What you know, I know also.  I am not inferior to you.
013:003 "Surely I would speak to the Almighty.  I desire to reason with God.
013:004 But you are forgers of lies.  You are all physicians of no value.
013:005 Oh that you would be completely silent!  Then you would be wise.
013:006 Hear now my reasoning.  Listen to the pleadings of my lips.
013:007 Will you speak unrighteously for God, and talk deceitfully for him?
013:008 Will you show partiality to him?  Will you contend for God?
013:009 Is it good that he should search you out?  Or as one deceives
        a man, will you deceive him?
013:010 He will surely reprove you if you secretly show partiality.
013:011 Shall not his majesty make you afraid, And his dread fall on you?
013:012 Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes, Your defenses
        are defenses of clay.
013:013 "Be silent, leave me alone, that I may speak.  Let come on
        me what will.
013:014 Why should I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life
        in my hand?
013:015 Behold, he will kill me.  I have no hope.  Nevertheless, I will
        maintain my ways before him.
013:016 This also shall be my salvation, that a godless man shall
        not come before him.
013:017 Hear diligently my speech.  Let my declaration be in your ears.
013:018 See now, I have set my cause in order.  I know that I am righteous.
013:019 Who is he who will contend with me?  For then would I hold
        my peace and give up the spirit.
013:020 "Only don't do two things to me; then I will not hide myself
        from your face:
013:021 withdraw your hand far from me; and don't let your terror
        make me afraid.
013:022 Then call, and I will answer; or let me speak, and you answer me.
013:023 How many are my iniquities and sins?  Make me know my disobedience
        and my sin.
013:024 Why hide you your face, and hold me for your enemy?
013:025 Will you harass a driven leaf?  Will you pursue the dry stubble?
013:026 For you write bitter things against me, and make me inherit
        the iniquities of my youth:
013:027 You also put my feet in the stocks, and mark all my paths.
        You set a bound to the soles of my feet,
013:028 though I am decaying like a rotten thing, like a garment
        that is moth-eaten.
014:001 "Man, who is born of a woman, is of few days, and full of trouble.
014:002 He comes forth like a flower, and is cut down.  He also flees
        like a shadow, and doesn't continue.
014:003 Do you open your eyes on such a one, and bring me into
        judgment with you?
014:004 Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?  Not one.
014:005 Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months is
        with you, and you have appointed his bounds that he can't pass;
014:006 Look away from him, that he may rest, until he shall accomplish,
        as a hireling, his day.
014:007 "For there is hope for a tree, If it is cut down, that it will
        sprout again, that the tender branch of it will not cease.
014:008 Though its root grows old in the earth, and its stock dies
        in the ground,
014:009 yet through the scent of water it will bud, and put forth
        boughs like a plant.
014:010 But man dies, and is laid low.  Yes, man gives up the spirit,
        and where is he?
014:011 As the waters fail from the sea, and the river wastes and dries up,
014:012 so man lies down and doesn't rise.  Until the heavens are no more,
        they shall not awake, nor be roused out of their sleep.
014:013 "Oh that you would hide me in Sheol, that you would keep me secret,
        until your wrath is past, that you would appoint me a set time,
        and remember me!
014:014 If a man dies, shall he live again?  All the days of my warfare
        would I wait, until my release should come.
014:015 You would call, and I would answer you.  You would have a desire
        to the work of your hands.
014:016 But now you number my steps.  Don't you watch over my sin?
014:017 My disobedience is sealed up in a bag.  You fasten up my iniquity.
014:018 "But the mountain falling comes to nothing.  The rock is removed
        out of its place;
014:019 The waters wear the stones.  The torrents of it wash away
        the dust of the earth.  So you destroy the hope of man.
014:020 You forever prevail against him, and he departs.
        You change his face, and send him away.
014:021 His sons come to honor, and he doesn't know it.
        They are brought low, but he doesn't perceive it of them.
014:022 But his flesh on him has pain, and his soul within him mourns."
015:001 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,
015:002 "Should a wise man answer with vain knowledge, and fill himself
        with the east wind?
015:003 Should he reason with unprofitable talk, or with speeches
        with which he can do no good?
015:004 Yes, you do away with fear, and hinder devotion before God.
015:005 For your iniquity teaches your mouth, and you choose the language
        of the crafty.
015:006 Your own mouth condemns you, and not I. Yes, your own lips
        testify against you.
015:007 "Are you the first man who was born?  Or were you brought
        forth before the hills?
015:008 Have you heard the secret counsel of God?  Do you limit
        wisdom to yourself?
015:009 What do you know, that we don't know?  What do you understand,
        which is not in us?
015:010 With us are both the gray-headed and the very aged men,
        much elder than your father.
015:011 Are the consolations of God too small for you, even the word
        that is gentle toward you?
015:012 Why does your heart carry you away?  Why do your eyes flash,
015:013 That you turn your spirit against God, and let such words go
        out of your mouth?
015:014 What is man, that he should be clean?  What is he who is born
        of a woman, that he should be righteous?
015:015 Behold, he puts no trust in his holy ones.  Yes, the heavens
        are not clean in his sight;
015:016 how much less one who is abominable and corrupt, a man who drinks
        iniquity like water!
015:017 "I will show you, listen to me; that which I have seen
        I will declare:
015:018 (Which wise men have told by their fathers, and have not hidden it;
015:019 to whom alone the land was given, and no stranger passed among them):
015:020 the wicked man writhes in pain all his days, even the number
        of years that are laid up for the oppressor.
015:021 A sound of terrors is in his ears.  In prosperity the destroyer
        shall come on him.
015:022 He doesn't believe that he shall return out of darkness.
        He is waited for by the sword.
015:023 He wanders abroad for bread, saying, 'Where is it?'
        He knows that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.
015:024 Distress and anguish make him afraid.  They prevail against him,
        as a king ready to the battle.
015:025 Because he has stretched out his hand against God, and behaves
        himself proudly against the Almighty;
015:026 he runs at him with a stiff neck, with the thick shields
        of his bucklers;
015:027 because he has covered his face with his fatness, and gathered
        fat on his thighs.
015:028 He has lived in desolate cities, in houses which no one inhabited,
        which were ready to become heaps.
015:029 He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue,
        neither shall their possessions be extended on the earth.
015:030 He shall not depart out of darkness.  The flame shall dry up
        his branches.  By the breath of God's mouth shall he go away.
015:031 Let him not trust in emptiness, deceiving himself; for emptiness
        shall be his reward.
015:032 It shall be accomplished before his time.  His branch shall
        not be green.
015:033 He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall
        cast off his flower as the olive tree.
015:034 For the company of the godless shall be barren, and fire shall
        consume the tents of bribery.
015:035 They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.
        Their heart prepares deceit."
016:001 Then Job answered,
016:002 "I have heard many such things.  You are all miserable comforters!
016:003 Shall vain words have an end?  Or what provokes you that you answer?
016:004 I also could speak as you do.  If your soul were in my
        soul's place, I could join words together against you,
        and shake my head at you,
016:005 but I would strengthen you with my mouth.  The solace of my
        lips would relieve you.
016:006 "Though I speak, my grief is not subsided.  Though I forbear,
        what am I eased?
016:007 But now, God, you have surely worn me out.  You have made
        desolate all my company.
016:008 You have shriveled me up.  This is a witness against me.
        My leanness rises up against me.  It testifies to my face.
016:009 He has torn me in his wrath, and persecuted me.
        He has gnashed on me with his teeth.  My adversary sharpens
        his eyes on me.
016:010 They have gaped on me with their mouth.  They have struck
        me on the cheek reproachfully.  They gather themselves
        together against me.
016:011 God delivers me to the ungodly, and casts me into the hands
        of the wicked.
016:012 I was at ease, and he broke me apart.  Yes, he has taken me
        by the neck, and dashed me to pieces.  He has also set me up
        for his target.
016:013 His archers surround me.  He splits my kidneys apart,
        and does not spare.  He pours out my gall on the ground.
016:014 He breaks me with breach on breach.  He runs on me like a giant.
016:015 I have sewed sackcloth on my skin, and have thrust my horn
        in the dust.
016:016 My face is red with weeping.  Deep darkness is on my eyelids.
016:017 Although there is no violence in my hands, and my prayer is pure.
016:018 "Earth, don't cover my blood.  Let my cry have no place to rest.
016:019 Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven.  He who vouches
        for me is on high.
016:020 My friends scoff at me.  My eyes pour out tears to God,
016:021 that he would maintain the right of a man with God, of a son
        of man with his neighbor!
016:022 For when a few years are come, I shall go the way from whence
        I shall not return.
017:001 "My spirit is consumed.  My days are extinct, And the grave
        is ready for me.
017:002 Surely there are mockers with me.  My eye dwells
        on their provocation.
017:003 "Now give a pledge, be collateral for me with yourself.
        Who is there who will strike hands with me?
017:004 For you have hidden their heart from understanding,
        Therefore shall you not exalt them.
017:005 He who denounces his friends for a prey, Even the eyes of his
        children shall fail.
017:006 "But he has made me a byword of the people.  They spit
        in my face.
017:007 My eye also is dim by reason of sorrow.  All my members are
        as a shadow.
017:008 Upright men shall be astonished at this.  The innocent shall
        stir up himself against the godless.
017:009 Yet shall the righteous hold on his way.  He who has clean
        hands shall grow stronger and stronger.
017:010 But as for you all, come on now again; I shall not find a wise
        man among you.
017:011 My days are past, my plans are broken off, as are the thoughts
        of my heart.
017:012 They change the night into day, saying 'The light is near'
        in the presence of darkness.
017:013 If I look for Sheol as my house, if I have spread my couch
        in the darkness,
017:014 If I have said to corruption, 'You are my father;' to the worm,
        'My mother,' and 'my sister;'
017:015 where then is my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?
017:016 Shall it go down with me to the gates of Sheol, or descend
        together into the dust?"
018:001 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,
018:002 "How long will you hunt for words?  Consider, and afterwards
        we will speak.
018:003 Why are we counted as animals, which have become unclean
        in your sight?
018:004 You who tear yourself in your anger, shall the earth be forsaken
        for you?  Or shall the rock be removed out of its place?
018:005 "Yes, the light of the wicked shall be put out, The spark
        of his fire shall not shine.
018:006 The light shall be dark in his tent.  His lamp above him shall
        be put out.
018:007 The steps of his strength shall be shortened.  His own counsel
        shall cast him down.
018:008 For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he wanders
        into its mesh.
018:009 A snare will take him by the heel.  A trap will catch him.
018:010 A noose is hidden for him in the ground, a trap for him
        in the way.
018:011 Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall chase
        him at his heels.
018:012 His strength shall be famished.  Calamity shall be ready
        at his side.
018:013 The members of his body shall be devoured.  The firstborn
        of death shall devour his members.
018:014 He shall be rooted out of his tent where he trusts.
        He shall be brought to the king of terrors.
018:015 There shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his.
        Sulfur shall be scattered on his habitation.
018:016 His roots shall be dried up beneath.  Above shall his branch
        be cut off.
018:017 His memory shall perish from the earth.  He shall have no name
        in the street.
018:018 He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out
        of the world.
018:019 He shall have neither son nor grandson among his people,
        nor any remaining where he sojourned.
018:020 Those who come after shall be astonished at his day,
        as those who went before were frightened.
018:021 Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous.
        This is the place of him who doesn't know God."
019:001 Then Job answered,
019:002 "How long will you torment me, and crush me with words?
019:003 You have reproached me ten times.  You aren't ashamed that
        you attack me.
019:004 If it is true that I have erred, my error remains with myself.
019:005 If indeed you will magnify yourselves against me, and plead
        against me my reproach;
019:006 know now that God has subverted me, and has surrounded me
        with his net.
019:007 "Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard.
        I cry for help, but there is no justice.
019:008 He has walled up my way so that I can't pass, and has set
        darkness in my paths.
019:009 He has stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head.
019:010 He has broken me down on every side, and I am gone.
        My hope he has plucked up like a tree.
019:011 He has also kindled his wrath against me.  He counts me
        among his adversaries.
019:012 His troops come on together, build a siege ramp against me,
        and encamp around my tent.
019:013 "He has put my brothers far from me.  My acquaintances are
        wholly estranged from me.
019:014 My relatives have gone away.  My familiar friends have forgotten me.
019:015 Those who dwell in my house, and my maids, count me for a stranger.
        I am an alien in their sight.
019:016 I call to my servant, and he gives me no answer.
        I beg him with my mouth.
019:017 My breath is offensive to my wife.  I am loathsome to the children
        of my own mother.
019:018 Even young children despise me.  If I arise, they speak against me.
019:019 All my familiar friends abhor me.  They whom I loved have
        turned against me.
019:020 My bones stick to my skin and to my flesh.  I have escaped
        by the skin of my teeth.
019:021 "Have pity on me, have pity on me, you my friends; for the hand
        of God has touched me.
019:022 Why do you persecute me as God, and are not satisfied
        with my flesh?
019:023 "Oh that my words were now written!  Oh that they were inscribed
        in a book!
019:024 That with an iron pen and lead they were engraved in
        the rock forever!
019:025 But as for me, I know that my Redeemer lives.  In the end,
        he will stand upon the earth.
019:026 After my skin is destroyed, then in my flesh shall I see God,
019:027 Whom I, even I, shall see on my side.  My eyes shall see,
        and not as a stranger.  "My heart is consumed within me.
019:028 If you say, 'How we will persecute him!' because the root
        of the matter is found in me,
019:029 be afraid of the sword, for wrath brings the punishments
        of the sword, that you may know there is a judgment."
020:001 Then Zophar the Naamathite answered,
020:002 "Therefore do my thoughts give answer to me, even by reason
        of my haste that is in me.
020:003 I have heard the reproof which puts me to shame.
        The spirit of my understanding answers me.
020:004 Don't you know this from old time, since man was placed on earth,
020:005 that the triumphing of the wicked is short, the joy of the godless
        but for a moment?
020:006 Though his height mount up to the heavens, and his head reach
        to the clouds,
020:007 yet he shall perish forever like his own dung.
        Those who have seen him shall say, 'Where is he?'
020:008 He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found.
        Yes, he shall be chased away like a vision of the night.
020:009 The eye which saw him shall see him no more, neither shall
        his place any more see him.
020:010 His children shall seek the favor of the poor.  His hands
        shall give back his wealth.
020:011 His bones are full of his youth, but youth shall lie down
        with him in the dust.
020:012 "Though wickedness is sweet in his mouth, though he hide it
        under his tongue,
020:013 though he spare it, and will not let it go, but keep it still
        within his mouth;
020:014 yet his food in his bowels is turned.  It is cobra venom within him.
020:015 He has swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again.
        God will cast them out of his belly.
020:016 He shall suck cobra venom.  The viper's tongue shall kill him.
020:017 He shall not look at the rivers, the flowing streams of
        honey and butter.
020:018 That for which he labored he shall restore, and shall not swallow
        it down.  According to the substance that he has gotten,
        he shall not rejoice.
020:019 For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor.  He has violently
        taken away a house, and he shall not build it up.
020:020 "Because he knew no quietness within him, he shall not save
        anything of that in which he delights.
020:021 There was nothing left that he didn't devour, therefore his
        prosperity shall not endure.
020:022 In the fullness of his sufficiency, distress shall overtake him.
        The hand of everyone who is in misery shall come on him.
020:023 When he is about to fill his belly, God will cast the fierceness
        of his wrath on him.  It will rain on him while he is eating.
020:024 He shall flee from the iron weapon.  The bronze arrow shall
        strike him through.
020:025 He draws it forth, and it comes out of his body.
        Yes, the glittering point comes out of his liver.
        Terrors are on him.
020:026 All darkness is laid up for his treasures.  An unfanned fire
        shall devour him.  It shall consume that which is left
        in his tent.
020:027 The heavens shall reveal his iniquity.  The earth shall rise
        up against him.
020:028 The increase of his house shall depart.  They shall rush away
        in the day of his wrath.
020:029 This is the portion of a wicked man from God, the heritage
        appointed to him by God."
021:001 Then Job answered,
021:002 "Listen diligently to my speech.  Let this be your consolation.
021:003 Allow me, and I also will speak; After I have spoken, mock on.
021:004 As for me, is my complaint to man?  Why shouldn't I be impatient?
021:005 Look at me, and be astonished.  Lay your hand on your mouth.
021:006 When I remember, I am troubled.  Horror takes hold of my flesh.
021:007 "Why do the wicked live, become old, yes, and grow mighty in power?
021:008 Their child is established with them in their sight,
        their offspring before their eyes.
021:009 Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of
        God upon them.
021:010 Their bulls breed without fail.  Their cows calve,
        and don't miscarry.
021:011 They send forth their little ones like a flock.
        Their children dance.
021:012 They sing to the tambourine and harp, and rejoice at the sound
        of the pipe.
021:013 They spend their days in prosperity.  In an instant they go
        down to Sheol.
021:014 They tell God, 'Depart from us, for we don't want to know
        about your ways.
021:015 What is the Almighty, that we should serve him?
        What profit should we have, if we pray to him?'
021:016 Behold, their prosperity is not in their hand.  The counsel
        of the wicked is far from me.
021:017 "How often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out,
        that their calamity comes on them, that God distributes
        sorrows in his anger?
021:018 How often is it that they are as stubble before the wind,
        as chaff that the storm carries away?
021:019 You say, 'God lays up his iniquity for his children.'
        Let him recompense it to himself, that he may know it.
021:020 Let his own eyes see his destruction.  Let him drink of the wrath
        of the Almighty.
021:021 For what does he care for his house after him, when the number
        of his months is cut off?
021:022 "Shall any teach God knowledge, seeing he judges those
        who are high?
021:023 One dies in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.
021:024 His pails are full of milk.  The marrow of his bones is moistened.
021:025 Another dies in bitterness of soul, and never tastes of good.
021:026 They lie down alike in the dust.  The worm covers them.
021:027 "Behold, I know your thoughts, the devices with which you
        would wrong me.
021:028 For you say, 'Where is the house of the prince?
        Where is the tent in which the wicked lived?'
021:029 Haven't you asked wayfaring men?  Don't you know their evidences,
021:030 that the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity,
        That they are led forth to the day of wrath?
021:031 Who shall declare his way to his face?  Who shall repay him
        what he has done?
021:032 Yet he will be borne to the grave.  Men shall keep watch
        over the tomb.
021:033 The clods of the valley shall be sweet to him.  All men shall
        draw after him, as there were innumerable before him.
021:034 So how can you comfort me with nonsense, seeing that in your
        answers there remains only falsehood?"
022:001 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,
022:002 "Can a man be profitable to God?  Surely he who is wise is
        profitable to himself.
022:003 Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that you are righteous?
        Or does it benefit him, that you make your ways perfect?
022:004 Is it for your piety that he reproves you, that he enters
        with you into judgment?
022:005 Isn't your wickedness great?  Neither is there any end
        to your iniquities.
022:006 For you have taken pledges from your brother for nothing,
        and stripped the naked of their clothing.
022:007 You haven't given water to the weary to drink, and you have
        withheld bread from the hungry.
022:008 But as for the mighty man, he had the earth.  The honorable man,
        he lived in it.
022:009 You have sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless
        have been broken.
022:010 Therefore snares are round about you.  Sudden fear troubles you,
022:011 or darkness, so that you can not see, and floods of waters cover you.
022:012 "Isn't God in the heights of heaven?  See the height of the stars,
        how high they are!
022:013 You say, 'What does God know?  Can he judge through
        the thick darkness?
022:014 Thick clouds are a covering to him, so that he doesn't see.
        He walks on the vault of the sky.'
022:015 Will you keep the old way, which wicked men have trodden,
022:016 who were snatched away before their time, whose foundation
        was poured out as a stream,
022:017 who said to God, 'Depart from us;' and, 'What can the Almighty
        do for us?'
022:018 Yet he filled their houses with good things, but the counsel
        of the wicked is far from me.
022:019 The righteous see it, and are glad.  The innocent ridicule them,
022:020 saying, 'Surely those who rose up against us are cut off.
        The fire has consumed the remnant of them.'
022:021 "Acquaint yourself with him, now, and be at peace.
        Thereby good shall come to you.
022:022 Please receive instruction from his mouth, and lay up his words
        in your heart.
022:023 If you return to the Almighty, you shall be built up, if you
        put away unrighteousness far from your tents.
022:024 Lay your treasure in the dust, the gold of Ophir among the stones
        of the brooks.
022:025 The Almighty will be your treasure, and precious silver to you.
022:026 For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty, and shall
        lift up your face to God.
022:027 You shall make your prayer to him, and he will hear you.
        You shall pay your vows.
022:028 You shall also decree a thing, and it shall be established to you.
        Light shall shine on your ways.
022:029 When they cast down, you shall say, 'be lifted up.'
        He will save the humble person.
022:030 He will even deliver him who is not innocent.  Yes, he shall
        be delivered through the cleanness of your hands."
023:001 Then Job answered,
023:002 "Even today my complaint is rebellious.  His hand is heavy
        in spite of my groaning.
023:003 Oh that I knew where I might find him!  That I might come
        even to his seat!
023:004 I would set my cause in order before him, and fill my
        mouth with arguments.
023:005 I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand
        what he would tell me.
023:006 Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power?
        No, but he would listen to me.
023:007 There the upright might reason with him, so I should be delivered
        forever from my judge.
023:008 "If I go east, he is not there; if west, I can't find him;
023:009 He works to the north, but I can't see him.  He turns south,
        but I can't catch a glimpse of him.
023:010 But he knows the way that I take.  When he has tried me,
        I shall come forth like gold.
023:011 My foot has held fast to his steps.  I have kept his way,
        and not turned aside.
023:012 I haven't gone back from the commandment of his lips.
        I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than
        my necessary food.
023:013 But he stands alone, and who can oppose him?  What his soul desires,
        even that he does.
023:014 For he performs that which is appointed for me.
        Many such things are with him.
023:015 Therefore I am terrified at his presence.  When I consider,
        I am afraid of him.
023:016 For God has made my heart faint.  The Almighty has terrified me.
023:017 Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither did
        he cover the thick darkness from my face.
024:001 "Why aren't times laid up by the Almighty?  Why don't those
        who know him see his days?
024:002 There are people who remove the landmarks.  They violently
        take away flocks, and feed them.
024:003 They drive away the donkey of the fatherless, and they take
        the widow's ox for a pledge.
024:004 They turn the needy out of the way.  The poor of the earth
        all hide themselves.
024:005 Behold, as wild donkeys in the desert, they go forth to their work,
        seeking diligently for food.  The wilderness yields them
        bread for their children.
024:006 They cut their provender in the field.  They glean the vineyard
        of the wicked.
024:007 They lie all night naked without clothing, and have no covering
        in the cold.
024:008 They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace
        the rock for lack of a shelter.
024:009 There are those who pluck the fatherless from the breast,
        and take a pledge of the poor,
024:010 So that they go around naked without clothing.  Being hungry,
        they carry the sheaves.
024:011 They make oil within the walls of these men.  They tread
        wine presses, and suffer thirst.
024:012 From out of the populous city, men groan.  The soul of the wounded
        cries out, yet God doesn't regard the folly.
024:013 "These are of those who rebel against the light.
        They don't know its ways, nor abide in its paths.
024:014 The murderer rises with the light.  He kills the poor and needy.
        In the night he is like a thief.
024:015 The eye also of the adulterer waits for the twilight, saying,
        'No eye shall see me.'  He disguises his face.
024:016 In the dark they dig through houses.  They shut themselves up
        in the daytime.  They don't know the light.
024:017 For the morning is to all of them like thick darkness,
        for they know the terrors of the thick darkness.
024:018 "They are foam on the surface of the waters.  Their portion
        is cursed in the earth.  They don't turn into the way
        of the vineyards.
024:019 Drought and heat consume the snow waters, so does Sheol
        those who have sinned.
024:020 The womb shall forget him.  The worm shall feed sweetly on him.
        He shall be no more remembered.  Unrighteousness shall be
        broken as a tree.
024:021 He devours the barren who don't bear.  He shows no kindness
        to the widow.
024:022 Yet God preserves the mighty by his power.  He rises up who has
        no assurance of life.
024:023 God gives them security, and they rest in it.  His eyes are
        on their ways.
024:024 They are exalted; yet a little while, and they are gone.
        Yes, they are brought low, they are taken out of the way as
        all others, and are cut off as the tops of the ears of grain.
024:025 If it isn't so now, who will prove me a liar, and make my
        speech worth nothing?"
025:001 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,
025:002 "Dominion and fear are with him.  He makes peace in his high places.
025:003 Can his armies be counted?  On whom does his light not arise?
025:004 How then can man be just with God?  Or how can he who is born
        of a woman be clean?
025:005 Behold, even the moon has no brightness, and the stars are
        not pure in his sight;
025:006 How much less man, who is a worm, the son of man, who is a worm!"
026:001 Then Job answered,
026:002 "How have you helped him who is without power!  How have you
        saved the arm that has no strength!
026:003 How have you counseled him who has no wisdom, and plentifully
        declared sound knowledge!
026:004 To whom have you uttered words?  Whose spirit came forth from you?
026:005 "Those who are deceased tremble, those beneath the waters
        and all that live in them.
026:006 Sheol{Sheol is the lower world or the grave.} is naked before God,
        and Abaddon{Abaddon means Destroyer.} has no covering.
026:007 He stretches out the north over empty space, and hangs
        the earth on nothing.
026:008 He binds up the waters in his thick clouds, and the cloud
        is not burst under them.
026:009 He encloses the face of his throne, and spreads his cloud on it.
026:010 He has described a boundary on the surface of the waters,
        and to the confines of light and darkness.
026:011 The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his rebuke.
026:012 He stirs up the sea with his power, and by his understanding
        he strikes through Rahab.
026:013 By his Spirit the heavens are garnished.  His hand has pierced
        the swift serpent.
026:014 Behold, these are but the outskirts of his ways.
        How small a whisper do we hear of him!  But the thunder
        of his power who can understand?"
027:001 Job again took up his parable, and said,
027:002 "As God lives, who has taken away my right, the Almighty,
        who has made my soul bitter.
027:003 (For the length of my life is still in me, and the spirit
        of God is in my nostrils);
027:004 surely my lips shall not speak unrighteousness, neither shall
        my tongue utter deceit.
027:005 Far be it from me that I should justify you.  Until I die I
        will not put away my integrity from me.
027:006 I hold fast to my righteousness, and will not let it go.
        My heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.
027:007 "Let my enemy be as the wicked.  Let him who rises up against
        me be as the unrighteous.
027:008 For what is the hope of the godless, when he is cut off,
        when God takes away his life?
027:009 Will God hear his cry when trouble comes on him?
027:010 Will he delight himself in the Almighty, and call on God
        at all times?
027:011 I will teach you about the hand of God.  That which is with
        the Almighty will I not conceal.
027:012 Behold, all of you have seen it yourselves; why then have you
        become altogether vain?
027:013 "This is the portion of a wicked man with God, the heritage
        of oppressors, which they receive from the Almighty.
027:014 If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword.
        His offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.
027:015 Those who remain of him shall be buried in death.
        His widows shall make no lamentation.
027:016 Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare clothing
        as the clay;
027:017 he may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent
        shall divide the silver.
027:018 He builds his house as the moth, as a booth which the watchman makes.
027:019 He lies down rich, but he shall not do so again.
        He opens his eyes, and he is not.
027:020 Terrors overtake him like waters.  A storm steals him away
        in the night.
027:021 The east wind carries him away, and he departs.
        It sweeps him out of his place.
027:022 For it hurls at him, and does not spare, as he flees away
        from his hand.
027:023 Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out
        of his place.
028:001 "Surely there is a mine for silver, and a place for gold
        which they refine.
028:002 Iron is taken out of the earth, and copper is smelted out
        of the ore.
028:003 Man sets an end to darkness, and searches out, to the furthest bound,
        the stones of obscurity and of thick darkness.
028:004 He breaks open a shaft away from where people live.
        They are forgotten by the foot.  They hang far from men,
        they swing back and forth.
028:005 As for the earth, out of it comes bread; Underneath it is turned
        up as it were by fire.
028:006 Sapphires come from its rocks.  It has dust of gold.
028:007 That path no bird of prey knows, neither has the falcon's
        eye seen it.
028:008 The proud animals have not trodden it, nor has the fierce lion
        passed by there.
028:009 He puts forth his hand on the flinty rock, and he overturns
        the mountains by the roots.
028:010 He cuts out channels among the rocks.  His eye sees
        every precious thing.
028:011 He binds the streams that they don't trickle.  The thing
        that is hidden he brings forth to light.
028:012 "But where shall wisdom be found?  Where is the place
        of understanding?
028:013 Man doesn't know its price; Neither is it found in the land
        of the living.
028:014 The deep says, 'It isn't in me.'  The sea says, 'It isn't with me.'
028:015 It can't be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed
        for its price.
028:016 It can't be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx,
        or the sapphire{or, lapis lazuli}.
028:017 Gold and glass can't equal it, neither shall it be exchanged
        for jewels of fine gold.
028:018 No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal.  Yes, the price
        of wisdom is above rubies.
028:019 The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, Neither shall it
        be valued with pure gold.
028:020 Whence then comes wisdom?  Where is the place of understanding?
028:021 Seeing it is hidden from the eyes of all living, and kept
        close from the birds of the sky.
028:022 Destruction and Death say, 'We have heard a rumor of it
        with our ears.'
028:023 "God understands its way, and he knows its place.
028:024 For he looks to the ends of the earth, and sees under
        the whole sky.
028:025 He establishes the force of the wind.  Yes, he measures out
        the waters by measure.
028:026 When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning
        of the thunder;
028:027 then he saw it, and declared it.  He established it, yes,
        and searched it out.
028:028 To man he said, 'Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom.
        To depart from evil is understanding.'"
029:001 Job again took up his parable, and said,
029:002 "Oh that I were as in the months of old, as in the days when God
        watched over me;
029:003 when his lamp shone on my head, and by his light I
        walked through darkness,
029:004 as I was in the ripeness of my days, when the friendship of God
        was in my tent,
029:005 when the Almighty was yet with me, and my children were around me,
029:006 when my steps were washed with butter, and the rock poured
        out streams of oil for me,
029:007 when I went forth to the city gate, when I prepared my seat
        in the street.
029:008 The young men saw me and hid themselves.  The aged rose
        up and stood.
029:009 The princes refrained from talking, and laid their hand
        on their mouth.
029:010 The voice of the nobles was hushed, and their tongue stuck
        to the roof of their mouth.
029:011 For when the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye
        saw me, it commended me:
029:012 Because I delivered the poor who cried, and the fatherless also,
        who had none to help him,
029:013 the blessing of him who was ready to perish came on me,
        and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.
029:014 I put on righteousness, and it clothed me.  My justice was
        as a robe and a diadem.
029:015 I was eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame.
029:016 I was a father to the needy.  The cause of him who I didn't know,
        I searched out.
029:017 I broke the jaws of the unrighteous, and plucked the prey
        out of his teeth.
029:018 Then I said, 'I shall die in my own house, I shall number
        my days as the sand.
029:019 My root is spread out to the waters.  The dew lies all night
        on my branch.
029:020 My glory is fresh in me.  My bow is renewed in my hand.'
029:021 "Men listened to me, waited, and kept silence for my counsel.
029:022 After my words they didn't speak again.  My speech fell on them.
029:023 They waited for me as for the rain.  Their mouths drank
        as with the spring rain.
029:024 I smiled on them when they had no confidence.  They didn't
        reject the light of my face.
029:025 I chose out their way, and sat as chief.  I lived as a king
        in the army, as one who comforts the mourners.
030:001 "But now those who are younger than I have me in derision,
        whose fathers I would have disdained to put with my sheep dogs.
030:002 Of what use is the strength of their hands to me, men in whom
        ripe age has perished?
030:003 They are gaunt from lack and famine.  They gnaw the dry ground,
        in the gloom of waste and desolation.
030:004 They pluck salt herbs by the bushes.  The roots of the broom
        are their food.
030:005 They are driven out from the midst of men.  They cry after them
        as after a thief;
030:006 So that they dwell in frightful valleys, and in holes of the earth
        and of the rocks.
030:007 Among the bushes they bray; and under the nettles they
        are gathered together.
030:008 They are children of fools, yes, children of base men.
        They were flogged out of the land.
030:009 "Now I have become their song.  Yes, I am a byword to them.
030:010 They abhor me, they stand aloof from me, and don't hesitate
        to spit in my face.
030:011 For he has untied his cord, and afflicted me; and they have
        thrown off restraint before me.
030:012 On my right hand rise the rabble.  They thrust aside my feet,
        They cast up against me their ways of destruction.
030:013 They mar my path, They set forward my calamity,
        without anyone's help.
030:014 As through a wide breach they come, in the midst of the ruin
        they roll themselves in.
030:015 Terrors have turned on me.  They chase my honor as the wind.
        My welfare has passed away as a cloud.
030:016 "Now my soul is poured out within me.  Days of affliction
        have taken hold on me.
030:017 In the night season my bones are pierced in me, and the pains
        that gnaw me take no rest.
030:018 By great force is my garment disfigured.  It binds me about
        as the collar of my coat.
030:019 He has cast me into the mire.  I have become like dust and ashes.
030:020 I cry to you, and you do not answer me.  I stand up, and you
        gaze at me.
030:021 You have turned to be cruel to me.  With the might of your hand
        you persecute me.
030:022 You lift me up to the wind, and drive me with it.
        You dissolve me in the storm.
030:023 For I know that you will bring me to death, To the house
        appointed for all living.
030:024 "However doesn't one stretch out a hand in his fall?
        Or in his calamity therefore cry for help?
030:025 Didn't I weep for him who was in trouble?  Wasn't my soul
        grieved for the needy?
030:026 When I looked for good, then evil came; When I waited for light,
        there came darkness.
030:027 My heart is troubled, and doesn't rest.  Days of affliction
        have come on me.
030:028 I go mourning without the sun.  I stand up in the assembly,
        and cry for help.
030:029 I am a brother to jackals, and a companion to ostriches.
030:030 My skin grows black and peels from me.  My bones are
        burned with heat.
030:031 Therefore my harp has turned to mourning, and my pipe into
        the voice of those who weep.
031:001 "I made a covenant with my eyes, how then should I look
        lustfully at a young woman?
031:002 For what is the portion from God above, and the heritage
        from the Almighty on high?
031:003 Is it not calamity to the unrighteous, and disaster to the
        workers of iniquity?
031:004 Doesn't he see my ways, and number all my steps?
031:005 "If I have walked with falsehood, and my foot has hurried to deceit
031:006 (let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may
        know my integrity);
031:007 if my step has turned out of the way, if my heart walked
        after my eyes, if any defilement has stuck to my hands,
031:008 then let me sow, and let another eat.  Yes, let the produce
        of my field be rooted out.
031:009 "If my heart has been enticed to a woman, and I have laid wait
        at my neighbor's door,
031:010 then let my wife grind for another, and let others sleep with her.
031:011 For that would be a heinous crime.  Yes, it would be an iniquity
        to be punished by the judges:
031:012 For it is a fire that consumes to destruction, and would root
        out all my increase.
031:013 "If I have despised the cause of my male servant or of my
        female servant, when they contended with me;
031:014 What then shall I do when God rises up?  When he visits,
        what shall I answer him?
031:015 Didn't he who made me in the womb make him?  Didn't one fashion
        us in the womb?
031:016 "If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused
        the eyes of the widow to fail,
031:017 or have eaten my morsel alone, and the fatherless has not
        eaten of it
031:018 (no, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father,
        her have I guided from my mother's womb);
031:019 if I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or that the needy
        had no covering;
031:020 if his heart hasn't blessed me, if he hasn't been warmed
        with my sheep's fleece;
031:021 if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, because I
        saw my help in the gate,
031:022 then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder blade, and my arm
        be broken from the bone.
031:023 For calamity from God is a terror to me.  Because his majesty,
        I can do nothing.
031:024 "If I have made gold my hope, and have said to the fine gold,
        'You are my confidence;'
031:025 If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because my
        hand had gotten much;
031:026 if I have seen the sun when it shined, or the moon moving in splendor,
031:027 and my heart has been secretly enticed, and my hand threw
        a kiss from my mouth,
031:028 this also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges;
        for I should have denied the God who is above.
031:029 "If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me,
        or lifted up myself when evil found him;
031:030 (yes, I have not allowed my mouth to sin by asking his life
        with a curse);
031:031 if the men of my tent have not said, 'Who can find one who has
        not been filled with his meat?'
031:032 (the foreigner has not lodged in the street, but I have opened
        my doors to the traveler);
031:033 if like Adam I have covered my transgressions, by hiding
        my iniquity in my heart,
031:034 because I feared the great multitude, and the contempt
        of families terrified me, so that I kept silence, and didn't
        go out of the door--
031:035 oh that I had one to hear me! (behold, here is my signature,
        let the Almighty answer me); let the accuser write my indictment!
031:036 Surely I would carry it on my shoulder; and I would bind it
        to me as a crown.
031:037 I would declare to him the number of my steps.  as a prince
        would I go near to him.
031:038 If my land cries out against me, and the furrows of it weep together;
031:039 if I have eaten the fruits of it without money, or have caused
        the owners of it to lose their life,
031:040 let briars grow instead of wheat, and stinkweed instead of barley."
        The words of Job are ended.
032:001 So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous
        in his own eyes.
032:002 Then the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel, the Buzite,
        of the family of Ram, was kindled against Job.  His wrath
        was kindled because he justified himself rather than God.
032:003 Also his wrath was kindled against his three friends,
        because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.
032:004 Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job, because they were
        elder than he.
032:005 When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these
        three men, his wrath was kindled.
032:006 Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered, "I am young,
        and you are very old; Therefore I held back, and didn't dare
        show you my opinion.
032:007 I said, 'Days should speak, and multitude of years
        should teach wisdom.'
032:008 But there is a spirit in man, and the breath of the Almighty
        gives them understanding.
032:009 It is not the great who are wise, nor the aged
        who understand justice.
032:010 Therefore I said, 'Listen to me; I also will show my opinion.'
032:011 "Behold, I waited for your words, and I listened for your reasoning,
        while you searched out what to say.
032:012 Yes, I gave you my full attention, but there was no one who
        convinced Job, or who answered his words, among you.
032:013 Beware lest you say, 'We have found wisdom, God may refute
        him, not man;'
032:014 for he has not directed his words against me; neither will I
        answer him with your speeches.
032:015 "They are amazed.  They answer no more.  They don't have
        a word to say.
032:016 Shall I wait, because they don't speak, because they stand still,
        and answer no more?
032:017 I also will answer my part, and I also will show my opinion.
032:018 For I am full of words.  The spirit within me constrains me.
032:019 Behold, my breast is as wine which has no vent; like new
        wineskins it is ready to burst.
032:020 I will speak, that I may be refreshed.  I will open my
        lips and answer.
032:021 Please don't let me respect any man's person, neither will I
        give flattering titles to any man.
032:022 For I don't know how to give flattering titles; or else my Maker
        would soon take me away.
033:001 "However, Job, Please hear my speech, and listen to all my words.
033:002 See now, I have opened my mouth.  My tongue has spoken
        in my mouth.
033:003 My words shall utter the uprightness of my heart.
        That which my lips know they shall speak sincerely.
033:004 The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty
        gives me life.
033:005 If you can, answer me.  Set your words in order before me,
        and stand forth.
033:006 Behold, I am toward God even as you are.  I am also formed
        out of the clay.
033:007 Behold, my terror shall not make you afraid, neither shall
        my pressure be heavy on you.
033:008 "Surely you have spoken in my hearing, I have heard the voice
        of your words, saying,
033:009 'I am clean, without disobedience.  I am innocent, neither is
        there iniquity in me.
033:010 Behold, he finds occasions against me.  He counts me for his enemy.
033:011 He puts my feet in the stocks.  He marks all my paths.'
033:012 "Behold, I will answer you.  In this you are not just,
        for God is greater than man.
033:013 Why do you strive against him, because he doesn't give account
        of any of his matters?
033:014 For God speaks once, yes twice, though man pays no attention.
033:015 In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls
        on men, in slumbering on the bed;
033:016 Then he opens the ears of men, and seals their instruction,
033:017 That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.
033:018 He keeps back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing
        by the sword.
033:019 He is chastened also with pain on his bed, with continual
        strife in his bones;
033:020 So that his life abhors bread, and his soul dainty food.
033:021 His flesh is so consumed away, that it can't be seen.
        His bones that were not seen stick out.
033:022 Yes, his soul draws near to the pit, and his life to the destroyers.
033:023 "If there is beside him an angel, an interpreter, one among
        a thousand, to show to man what is right for him;
033:024 then God is gracious to him, and says, 'Deliver him from going
        down to the pit, I have found a ransom.'
033:025 His flesh shall be fresher than a child's. He returns to the days
        of his youth.
033:026 He prays to God, and he is favorable to him, so that he sees
        his face with joy.  He restores to man his righteousness.
033:027 He sings before men, and says, 'I have sinned, and perverted
        that which was right, and it didn't profit me.
033:028 He has redeemed my soul from going into the pit.
        My life shall see the light.'
033:029 "Behold, God works all these things, twice, yes three times,
        with a man,
033:030 to bring back his soul from the pit, that he may be enlightened
        with the light of the living.
033:031 Mark well, Job, and listen to me.  Hold your peace,
        and I will speak.
033:032 If you have anything to say, answer me.  Speak, for I desire
        to justify you.
033:033 If not, listen to me.  Hold your peace, and I will teach you wisdom."
034:001 Moreover Elihu answered,
034:002 "Hear my words, you wise men.  Give ear to me,
        you who have knowledge.
034:003 For the ear tries words, as the palate tastes food.
034:004 Let us choose for us that which is right.  Let us know among
        ourselves what is good.
034:005 For Job has said, 'I am righteous, God has taken away my right:
034:006 Notwithstanding my right I am considered a liar.
        My wound is incurable, though I am without disobedience.'
034:007 What man is like Job, who drinks scorn like water,
034:008 Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity, and walks
        with wicked men?
034:009 For he has said, 'It profits a man nothing that he should
        delight himself with God.'
034:010 "Therefore listen to me, you men of understanding:  far be it
        from God, that he should do wickedness, from the Almighty,
        that he should commit iniquity.
034:011 For the work of a man he will render to him, and cause every
        man to find according to his ways.
034:012 Yes surely, God will not do wickedly, neither will the
        Almighty pervert justice.
034:013 Who gave him a charge over the earth? or who has appointed
        him over the whole world?
034:014 If he set his heart on himself, If he gathered to himself
        his spirit and his breath,
034:015 all flesh would perish together, and man would turn again to dust.
034:016 "If now you have understanding, hear this.  Listen to the voice
        of my words.
034:017 Shall even one who hates justice govern?  Will you condemn
        him who is righteous and mighty?--
034:018 Who says to a king, 'Vile!' or to nobles, 'Wicked!'?
034:019 Who doesn't respect the persons of princes, nor regards the rich
        more than the poor; for they all are the work of his hands.
034:020 In a moment they die, even at midnight.  The people are shaken
        and pass away.  The mighty are taken away without a hand.
034:021 "For his eyes are on the ways of a man.  He sees all his goings.
034:022 There is no darkness, nor thick gloom, where the workers
        of iniquity may hide themselves.
034:023 For he doesn't need to consider a man further, that he should
        go before God in judgment.
034:024 He breaks in pieces mighty men in ways past finding out,
        and sets others in their place.
034:025 Therefore he takes knowledge of their works.  He overturns
        them in the night, so that they are destroyed.
034:026 He strikes them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
034:027 because they turned aside from following him, and wouldn't
        pay attention to any of his ways,
034:028 so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him.
        He heard the cry of the afflicted.
034:029 When he gives quietness, who then can condemn?  When he hides
        his face, who then can see him?  Alike whether to a nation,
        or to a man,
034:030 that the godless man may not reign, that there be no one
        to ensnare the people.
034:031 "For has any said to God, 'I am guilty, but I will not
        offend any more.
034:032 Teach me that which I don't see.  If I have done iniquity,
        I will do it no more'?
034:033 Shall his recompense be as you desire, that you refuse it?
        For you must choose, and not I. Therefore speak what you know.
034:034 Men of understanding will tell me, yes, every wise man
        who hears me:
034:035 'Job speaks without knowledge.  His words are without wisdom.'
034:036 I wish that Job were tried to the end, because of his answering
        like wicked men.
034:037 For he adds rebellion to his sin.  He claps his hands among us,
        and multiplies his words against God."
035:001 Moreover Elihu answered,
035:002 "Do you think this to be your right, or do you say,
        'My righteousness is more than God's,'
035:003 That you ask, 'What advantage will it be to you?
        What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?'
035:004 I will answer you, and your companions with you.
035:005 Look to the heavens, and see.  See the skies, which are
        higher than you.
035:006 If you have sinned, what effect do you have against him?
        If your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to him?
035:007 If you are righteous, what do you give him?  Or what does
        he receive from your hand?
035:008 Your wickedness may hurt a man as you are, and your righteousness
        may profit a son of man.
035:009 "By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out.
        They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty.
035:010 But none says, 'Where is God my Maker, who gives songs
        in the night,
035:011 who teaches us more than the animals of the earth, and makes
        us wiser than the birds of the sky?'
035:012 There they cry, but none gives answer, because of the pride
        of evil men.
035:013 Surely God will not hear an empty cry, neither will the
        Almighty regard it.
035:014 How much less when you say you don't see him.  The cause
        is before him, and you wait for him!
035:015 But now, because he has not visited in his anger, neither does
        he greatly regard arrogance.
035:016 Therefore Job opens his mouth with empty talk, and he multiplies
        words without knowledge."
036:001 Elihu also continued, and said,
036:002 "Bear with me a little, and I will show you; for I still
        have something to say on God's behalf.
036:003 I will get my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness
        to my Maker.
036:004 For truly my words are not false.  One who is perfect in knowledge
        is with you.
036:005 "Behold, God is mighty, and doesn't despise anyone.
        He is mighty in strength of understanding.
036:006 He doesn't preserve the life of the wicked, but gives to
        the afflicted their right.
036:007 He doesn't withdraw his eyes from the righteous, but with kings
        on the throne, he sets them forever, and they are exalted.
036:008 If they are bound in fetters, and are taken in the
        cords of afflictions,
036:009 then he shows them their work, and their transgressions,
        that they have behaved themselves proudly.
036:010 He also opens their ears to instruction, and commands that they
        return from iniquity.
036:011 If they listen and serve him, they shall spend their days
        in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.
036:012 But if they don't listen, they shall perish by the sword;
        they shall die without knowledge.
036:013 "But those who are godless in heart lay up anger.
        They don't cry for help when he binds them.
036:014 They die in youth.  Their life perishes among the unclean.
036:015 He delivers the afflicted by their affliction, and opens
        their ear in oppression.
036:016 Yes, he would have allured you out of distress, into a broad place,
        where there is no restriction.  That which is set on your table
        would be full of fatness.
036:017 "But you are full of the judgment of the wicked.
        Judgment and justice take hold of you.
036:018 Don't let riches entice you to wrath, neither let the great
        size of a bribe turn you aside.
036:019 Would your wealth sustain you in distress, or all the might
        of your strength?
036:020 Don't desire the night, when people are cut off in their place.
036:021 Take heed, don't regard iniquity; for you have chosen this
        rather than affliction.
036:022 Behold, God is exalted in his power.  Who is a teacher like him?
036:023 Who has prescribed his way for him?  Or who can say,
        'You have committed unrighteousness?'
036:024 "Remember that you magnify his work, whereof men have sung.
036:025 All men have looked thereon.  Man sees it afar off.
036:026 Behold, God is great, and we don't know him.  The number
        of his years is unsearchable.
036:027 For he draws up the drops of water, which distill in rain
        from his vapor,
036:028 Which the skies pour down and which drop on man abundantly.
036:029 Yes, can any understand the spreading of the clouds,
        and the thunderings of his pavilion?
036:030 Behold, he spreads his light around him.  He covers the bottom
        of the sea.
036:031 For by these he judges the people.  He gives food in abundance.
036:032 He covers his hands with the lightning, and commands it
        to strike the mark.
036:033 Its noise tells about him, and the livestock also concerning
        the storm that comes up.
037:001 "Yes, at this my heart trembles, and is moved out of its place.
037:002 Hear, oh, hear the noise of his voice, the sound that goes
        out of his mouth.
037:003 He sends it forth under the whole sky, and his lightning
        to the ends of the earth.
037:004 After it a voice roars.  He thunders with the voice of his majesty.
        He doesn't hold back anything when his voice is heard.
037:005 God thunders marvelously with his voice.  He does great things,
        which we can't comprehend.
037:006 For he says to the snow, 'Fall on the earth;' likewise to
        the shower of rain, and to the showers of his mighty rain.
037:007 He seals up the hand of every man, that all men whom he has
        made may know it.
037:008 Then the animals take cover, and remain in their dens.
037:009 Out of its chamber comes the storm, and cold out of the north.
037:010 By the breath of God, ice is given, and the breadth of the
        waters is frozen.
037:011 Yes, he loads the thick cloud with moisture.  He spreads abroad
        the cloud of his lightning.
037:012 It is turned round about by his guidance, that they may do
        whatever he commands them on the surface of the habitable world,
037:013 Whether it is for correction, or for his land, or for loving kindness,
        that he causes it to come.
037:014 "Listen to this, Job.  Stand still, and consider the wondrous
        works of God.
037:015 Do you know how God controls them, and causes the lightning
        of his cloud to shine?
037:016 Do you know the workings of the clouds, the wondrous works
        of him who is perfect in knowledge?
037:017 You whose clothing is warm, when the earth is still by reason
        of the south wind?
037:018 Can you, with him, spread out the sky, which is strong as a
        cast metal mirror?
037:019 Teach us what we shall tell him, for we can't make our case
        by reason of darkness.
037:020 Shall it be told him that I would speak?  Or should a man wish
        that he were swallowed up?
037:021 Now men don't see the light which is bright in the skies,
        but the wind passes, and clears them.
037:022 Out of the north comes golden splendor.  With God is awesome majesty.
037:023 We can't reach the Almighty.  He is exalted in power.
        In justice and great righteousness, he will not oppress.
037:024 Therefore men revere him.  He doesn't regard any who are
        wise of heart."
038:001 Then Yahweh answered Job out of the whirlwind,
038:002 "Who is this who darkens counsel by words without knowledge?
038:003 Brace yourself like a man, for I will question you,
        then you answer me!
038:004 "Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth?
        Declare, if you have understanding.
038:005 Who determined the measures of it, if you know?
        Or who stretched the line on it?
038:006 Whereupon were the foundations of it fastened?
        Or who laid its cornerstone,
038:007 when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God
        shouted for joy?
038:008 "Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it broke forth
        from the womb,
038:009 when I made clouds its garment, and wrapped it in thick darkness,
038:010 marked out for it my bound, set bars and doors,
038:011 and said, 'Here you may come, but no further.  Here shall
        your proud waves be stayed?'
038:012 "Have you commanded the morning in your days, and caused
        the dawn to know its place;
038:013 that it might take hold of the ends of the earth, and shake
        the wicked out of it?
038:014 It is changed as clay under the seal, and stands forth
        as a garment.
038:015 From the wicked, their light is withheld.  The high arm is broken.
038:016 "Have you entered into the springs of the sea?  Or have you
        walked in the recesses of the deep?
038:017 Have the gates of death been revealed to you?  Or have you
        seen the gates of the shadow of death?
038:018 Have you comprehended the earth in its breadth?  Declare, if you
        know it all.
038:019 "What is the way to the dwelling of light?  As for darkness,
        where is its place,
038:020 that you should take it to its bound, that you should discern
        the paths to its house?
038:021 Surely you know, for you were born then, and the number of your
        days is great!
038:022 Have you entered the treasuries of the snow, or have you seen
        the treasures of the hail,
038:023 which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day
        of battle and war?
038:024 By what way is the lightning distributed, or the east wind
        scattered on the earth?
038:025 Who has cut a channel for the flood water, or the path
        for the thunderstorm;
038:026 To cause it to rain on a land where no man is; on the wilderness,
        in which there is no man;
038:027 to satisfy the waste and desolate ground, to cause the tender
        grass to spring forth?
038:028 Does the rain have a father?  Or who fathers the drops of dew?
038:029 Out of whose womb came the ice?  The gray frost of the sky,
        who has given birth to it?
038:030 The waters become hard like stone, when the surface of the
        deep is frozen.
038:031 "Can you bind the cluster of the Pleiades, or loosen
        the cords of Orion?
038:032 Can you lead forth the constellations in their season?
        Or can you guide the Bear with her cubs?
038:033 Do you know the laws of the heavens?  Can you establish
        the dominion of it over the earth?
038:034 "Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, That abundance
        of waters may cover you?
038:035 Can you send forth lightnings, that they may go?
        Do they report to you, 'Here we are?'
038:036 Who has put wisdom in the inward parts?  Or who has given
        understanding to the mind?
038:037 Who can number the clouds by wisdom?  Or who can pour out
        the bottles of the sky,
038:038 when the dust runs into a mass, and the clods of
        earth stick together?
038:039 "Can you hunt the prey for the lioness, or satisfy the appetite
        of the young lions,
038:040 when they crouch in their dens, and lie in wait in the thicket?
038:041 Who provides for the raven his prey, when his young ones cry
        to God, and wander for lack of food?
039:001 "Do you know the time when the mountain goats give birth?
        Do you watch when the doe bears fawns?
039:002 Can you number the months that they fulfill?  Or do you know
        the time when they give birth?
039:003 They bow themselves, they bring forth their young, they end
        their labor pains.
039:004 Their young ones become strong.  They grow up in the open field.
        They go forth, and don't return again.
039:005 "Who has set the wild donkey free?  Or who has loosened
        the bonds of the swift donkey,
039:006 Whose home I have made the wilderness, and the salt land
        his dwelling place?
039:007 He scorns the tumult of the city, neither does he hear
        the shouting of the driver.
039:008 The range of the mountains is his pasture, He searches after
        every green thing.
039:009 "Will the wild ox be content to serve you?  Or will he stay
        by your feeding trough?
039:010 Can you hold the wild ox in the furrow with his harness?
        Or will he till the valleys after you?
039:011 Will you trust him, because his strength is great?
        Or will you leave to him your labor?
039:012 Will you confide in him, that he will bring home your seed,
        and gather the grain of your threshing floor?
039:013 "The wings of the ostrich wave proudly; but are they the feathers
        and plumage of love?
039:014 For she leaves her eggs on the earth, warms them in the dust,
039:015 and forgets that the foot may crush them, or that the wild
        animal may trample them.
039:016 She deals harshly with her young ones, as if they were not hers.
        Though her labor is in vain, she is without fear,
039:017 because God has deprived her of wisdom, neither has he imparted
        to her understanding.
039:018 When she lifts up herself on high, she scorns the horse
        and his rider.
039:019 "Have you given the horse might?  Have you clothed his neck
        with a quivering mane?
039:020 Have you made him to leap as a locust?  The glory of his
        snorting is awesome.
039:021 He paws in the valley, and rejoices in his strength.
        He goes out to meet the armed men.
039:022 He mocks at fear, and is not dismayed, neither does he turn
        back from the sword.
039:023 The quiver rattles against him, the flashing spear and the javelin.
039:024 He eats up the ground with fierceness and rage, neither does
        he stand still at the sound of the trumpet.
039:025 As often as the trumpet sounds he snorts, 'Aha!'  He smells
        the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains,
        and the shouting.
039:026 "Is it by your wisdom that the hawk soars, and stretches her
        wings toward the south?
039:027 Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up, and makes
        his nest on high?
039:028 On the cliff he dwells, and makes his home, on the point
        of the cliff, and the stronghold.
039:029 From there he spies out the prey.  His eyes see it afar off.
039:030 His young ones also suck up blood.  Where the slain are,
        there he is."
040:001 Moreover Yahweh answered Job,
040:002 "Shall he who argues contend with the Almighty?  He who argues
        with God, let him answer it."
040:003 Then Job answered Yahweh,
040:004 "Behold, I am of small account.  What shall I answer you?
        I lay my hand on my mouth.
040:005 I have spoken once, and I will not answer; Yes, twice, but I
        will proceed no further."
040:006 Then Yahweh answered Job out of the whirlwind,
040:007 "Now brace yourself like a man.  I will question you, and you
        will answer me.
040:008 Will you even annul my judgment?  Will you condemn me,
        that you may be justified?
040:009 Or do you have an arm like God?  Can you thunder with a
        voice like him?
040:010 "Now deck yourself with excellency and dignity.
        Array yourself with honor and majesty.
040:011 Pour out the fury of your anger.  Look at everyone who is proud,
        and bring him low.
040:012 Look at everyone who is proud, and humble him.  Crush the wicked
        in their place.
040:013 Hide them in the dust together.  Bind their faces in
        the hidden place.
040:014 Then I will also admit to you that your own right hand
        can save you.
040:015 "See now, behemoth, which I made as well as you.
        He eats grass as an ox.
040:016 Look now, his strength is in his thighs.  His force is in
        the muscles of his belly.
040:017 He moves his tail like a cedar.  The sinews of his thighs
        are knit together.
040:018 His bones are like tubes of brass.  His limbs are like
        bars of iron.
040:019 He is the chief of the ways of God.  He who made him gives
        him his sword.
040:020 Surely the mountains produce food for him, where all the animals
        of the field play.
040:021 He lies under the lotus trees, in the covert of the reed,
        and the marsh.
040:022 The lotuses cover him with their shade.  The willows of
        the brook surround him.
040:023 Behold, if a river overflows, he doesn't tremble.
        He is confident, though the Jordan swells even to his mouth.
040:024 Shall any take him when he is on the watch, or pierce through
        his nose with a snare?
041:001 "Can you draw out Leviathan{Leviathan is a name for a crocodile
        or similar creature.} with a fishhook, or press down his tongue
        with a cord?
041:002 Can you put a rope into his nose, or pierce his jaw through
        with a hook?
041:003 Will he make many petitions to you, or will he speak soft
        words to you?
041:004 Will he make a covenant with you, that you should take him
        for a servant forever?
041:005 Will you play with him as with a bird?  Or will you bind him
        for your girls?
041:006 Will traders barter for him?  Will they part him among the merchants?
041:007 Can you fill his skin with barbed irons, or his head
        with fish spears?
041:008 Lay your hand on him.  Remember the battle, and do so no more.
041:009 Behold, the hope of him is in vain.  Won't one be cast down
        even at the sight of him?
041:010 None is so fierce that he dare stir him up.  Who then is
        he who can stand before me?
041:011 Who has first given to me, that I should repay him?
        Everything under the heavens is mine.
041:012 "I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, nor his
        mighty strength, nor his goodly frame.
041:013 Who can strip off his outer garment?  Who shall come
        within his jaws?
041:014 Who can open the doors of his face?  Around his teeth is terror.
041:015 Strong scales are his pride, shut up together with a close seal.
041:016 One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.
041:017 They are joined one to another.  They stick together,
        so that they can't be pulled apart.
041:018 His sneezing flashes out light.  His eyes are like the eyelids
        of the morning.
041:019 Out of his mouth go burning torches.  Sparks of fire leap forth.
041:020 Out of his nostrils a smoke goes, as of a boiling pot over
        a fire of reeds.
041:021 His breath kindles coals.  A flame goes forth from his mouth.
041:022 There is strength in his neck.  Terror dances before him.
041:023 The flakes of his flesh are joined together.  They are firm on him.
        They can't be moved.
041:024 His heart is as firm as a stone, yes, firm as the lower millstone.
041:025 When he raises himself up, the mighty are afraid.
        They retreat before his thrashing.
041:026 If one attacks him with the sword, it can't prevail;
        nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft.
041:027 He counts iron as straw; and brass as rotten wood.
041:028 The arrow can't make him flee.  Sling stones are like chaff to him.
041:029 Clubs are counted as stubble.  He laughs at the rushing
        of the javelin.
041:030 His undersides are like sharp potsherds, leaving a trail
        in the mud like a threshing sledge.
041:031 He makes the deep to boil like a pot.  He makes the sea
        like a pot of ointment.
041:032 He makes a path shine after him.  One would think the deep
        had white hair.
041:033 On earth there is not his equal, that is made without fear.
041:034 He sees everything that is high.  He is king over all
        the sons of pride."
042:001 Then Job answered Yahweh,
042:002 "I know that you can do all things, and that no purpose of yours
        can be restrained.
042:003 You asked, 'Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge?'
        therefore I have uttered that which I did not understand,
        things too wonderful for me, which I didn't know.
042:004 You said, 'Listen, now, and I will speak; I will question you,
        and you will answer me.'
042:005 I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear, but now my
        eye sees you.
042:006 Therefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes."
042:007 It was so, that after Yahweh had spoken these words
        to Job, Yahweh said to Eliphaz the Temanite, "My wrath
        is kindled against you, and against your two friends;
        for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right,
        as my servant Job has.
042:008 Now therefore, take to yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, and go
        to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering;
        and my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept him,
        that I not deal with you according to your folly.
        For you have not spoken of me the thing that is right,
        as my servant Job has."
042:009 So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar
        the Naamathite went, and did what Yahweh commanded them,
        and Yahweh accepted Job.
042:010 Yahweh turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends.
        Yahweh gave Job twice as much as he had before.
042:011 Then came there to him all his brothers, and all his sisters,
        and all those who had been of his acquaintance before, and ate
        bread with him in his house.  They comforted him, and consoled
        him concerning all the evil that Yahweh had brought on him.
        Everyone also gave him a piece of money,{literally, kesitah,
        a unit of money, probably silver} and everyone a ring of gold.
042:012 So Yahweh blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning.
        He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels,
        one thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand female donkeys.
042:013 He had also seven sons and three daughters.
042:014 He called the name of the first, Jemimah; and the name of
        the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren Happuch.
042:015 In all the land were no women found so beautiful as the
        daughters of Job.  Their father gave them an inheritance
        among their brothers.
042:016 After this Job lived one hundred forty years, and saw his sons,
        and his sons' sons, to four generations.
042:017 So Job died, being old and full of days.

Book 19 Psalms
001:001 Blessed is the man who doesn't walk in the counsel of the wicked,
        nor stand in the way of sinners, nor sit in the seat of scoffers;
001:002 but his delight is in Yahweh's law.  On his law he meditates
        day and night.
001:003 He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water, that brings
        forth its fruit in its season, whose leaf also does not wither.
        Whatever he does shall prosper.
001:004 The wicked are not so, but are like the chaff which the
        wind drives away.
001:005 Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment,
        nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
001:006 For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous, but the way
        of the wicked shall perish.
002:001 Why do the nations rage, and the peoples plot a vain thing?
002:002 The kings of the earth take a stand, and the rulers take
        counsel together, against Yahweh, and against his Anointed,{The
        word "Anointed" is the same as the word for "Messiah"
        or "Christ"} saying,
002:003 "Let's break their bonds apart, and cast their cords from us."
002:004 He who sits in the heavens will laugh.  The Lord will have
        them in derision.
002:005 Then he will speak to them in his anger, and terrify them
        in his wrath:
002:006 "Yet I have set my king on my holy hill of Zion."
002:007 I will tell of the decree.  Yahweh said to me, "You are my son.
        Today I have become your father.
002:008 Ask of me, and I will give the nations for your inheritance,
        the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.
002:009 You shall break them with a rod of iron.  You shall dash them
        in pieces like a potter's vessel."
002:010 Now therefore be wise, you kings.  Be instructed, you judges
        of the earth.
002:011 Serve Yahweh with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
002:012 Give sincere homage{or, Kiss the son}, lest he be angry,
        and you perish in the way, for his wrath will soon be kindled.
        Blessed are all those who take refuge in him.
003:001 <<A Psalm by David, when he fled from Absalom his son.>> Yahweh,
        how my adversaries have increased!  Many are those who rise
        up against me.
003:002 Many there are who say of my soul, "There is no help for him
        in God."  Selah.
003:003 But you, Yahweh, are a shield around me, my glory, and the one
        who lifts up my head.
003:004 I cry to Yahweh with my voice, and he answers me out of his
        holy hill.  Selah.
003:005 I laid myself down and slept.  I awakened; for Yahweh sustains me.
003:006 I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people who have
        set themselves against me on every side.
003:007 Arise, Yahweh!  Save me, my God!  For you have struck all
        of my enemies on the cheek bone.  You have broken the teeth
        of the wicked.
003:008 Salvation belongs to Yahweh.  Your blessing be on
        your people.  Selah.
004:001 <<For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments.  A Psalm
        by David.>> Answer me when I call, God of my righteousness.
        Give me relief from my distress.  Have mercy on me,
        and hear my prayer.
004:002 You sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor?
        Will you love vanity, and seek after falsehood?  Selah.
004:003 But know that Yahweh has set apart for himself him who is godly:
        Yahweh will hear when I call to him.
004:004 Stand in awe, and don't sin.  Search your own heart on your bed,
        and be still.  Selah.
004:005 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness.  Put your trust in Yahweh.
004:006 Many say, "Who will show us any good?"  Yahweh, let the light
        of your face shine on us.
004:007 You have put gladness in my heart, more than when their grain
        and their new wine are increased.
004:008 In peace I will both lay myself down and sleep, for you,
        Yahweh alone, make me live in safety.
005:001 <<For the Chief Musician, with the flutes.  A Psalm by David.>>
        Give ear to my words, Yahweh.  Consider my meditation.
005:002 Listen to the voice of my cry, my King and my God; for to you
        do I pray.
005:003 Yahweh, in the morning you shall hear my voice.  In the morning
        I will lay my requests before you, and will watch expectantly.
005:004 For you are not a God who has pleasure in wickedness.
        Evil can't live with you.
005:005 The arrogant shall not stand in your sight.  You hate all
        workers of iniquity.
005:006 You will destroy those who speak lies.  Yahweh abhors
        the blood-thirsty and deceitful man.
005:007 But as for me, in the abundance of your loving kindness I
        will come into your house.  I will bow toward your holy temple
        in reverence of you.
005:008 Lead me, Yahweh, in your righteousness because of my enemies.
        Make your way straight before my face.
005:009 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth.
        Their heart is destruction.  Their throat is an open tomb.
        They flatter with their tongue.
005:010 Hold them guilty, God.  Let them fall by their own counsels;
        Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions,
        for they have rebelled against you.
005:011 But let all those who take refuge in you rejoice,
        Let them always shout for joy, because you defend them.
        Let them also who love your name be joyful in you.
005:012 For you will bless the righteous.  Yahweh, you will surround
        him with favor as with a shield.
006:001 <<For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments,
        upon the eight-stringed lyre.  A Psalm by David.>> Yahweh,
        don't rebuke me in your anger, neither discipline me
        in your wrath.
006:002 Have mercy on me, Yahweh, for I am faint.  Yahweh, heal me,
        for my bones are troubled.
006:003 My soul is also in great anguish.  But you, Yahweh--how long?
006:004 Return, Yahweh.  Deliver my soul, and save me for your
        loving kindness' sake.
006:005 For in death there is no memory of you.  In Sheol, who shall
        give you thanks?
006:006 I am weary with my groaning.  Every night I flood my bed.
        I drench my couch with my tears.
006:007 My eye wastes away because of grief.  It grows old because of
        all my adversaries.
006:008 Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity, for Yahweh has
        heard the voice of my weeping.
006:009 Yahweh has heard my supplication.  Yahweh accepts my prayer.
006:010 May all my enemies be ashamed and dismayed.  They shall turn back,
        they shall be disgraced suddenly.
007:001 <<A meditation by David, which he sang to Yahweh, concerning the words
        of Cush, the Benjamite.>> Yahweh, my God, I take refuge in you.
        Save me from all those who pursue me, and deliver me,
007:002 lest they tear apart my soul like a lion, ripping it in pieces,
        while there is none to deliver.
007:003 Yahweh, my God, if I have done this, if there is iniquity
        in my hands,
007:004 if I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me (yes, if I
        have delivered him who without cause was my adversary),
007:005 let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it; yes, let him tread
        my life down to the earth, and lay my glory in the dust.  Selah.
007:006 Arise, Yahweh, in your anger.  Lift up yourself against the rage
        of my adversaries.  Awake for me.  You have commanded judgment.
007:007 Let the congregation of the peoples surround you.
        Rule over them on high.
007:008 Yahweh administers judgment to the peoples.  Judge me,
        Yahweh, according to my righteousness, and to my integrity
        that is in me.
007:009 Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end,
        but establish the righteous; their minds and hearts are searched
        by the righteous God.
007:010 My shield is with God, who saves the upright in heart.
007:011 God is a righteous judge, yes, a God who has indignation every day.
007:012 If a man doesn't relent, he will sharpen his sword; he has
        bent and strung his bow.
007:013 He has also prepared for himself the instruments of death.
        He makes ready his flaming arrows.
007:014 Behold, he travails with iniquity.  Yes, he has conceived mischief,
        and brought forth falsehood.
007:015 He has dug a hole, and has fallen into the pit which he made.
007:016 The trouble he causes shall return to his own head.
        His violence shall come down on the crown of his own head.
007:017 I will give thanks to Yahweh according to his righteousness,
        and will sing praise to the name of Yahweh Most High.
008:001 <<For the Chief Musician; on an instrument of Gath.
        A Psalm by David.>> Yahweh, our Lord, how majestic is your name
        in all the earth, who has set your glory above the heavens!
008:002 From the lips of babes and infants you have established strength,
        because of your adversaries, that you might silence the enemy
        and the avenger.
008:003 When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers,
        the moon and the stars, which you have ordained;
008:004 what is man, that you think of him?  What is the son of man,
        that you care for him?
008:005 For you have made him a little lower than God,{Hebrew: Elohim}
        and crowned him with glory and honor.
008:006 You make him ruler over the works of your hands.
        You have put all things under his feet:
008:007 All sheep and oxen, yes, and the animals of the field,
008:008 The birds of the sky, the fish of the sea, and whatever passes
        through the paths of the seas.
008:009 Yahweh, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!
009:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  Set to "The Death of the Son."
        A Psalm by David.>> I will give thanks to Yahweh with my
        whole heart.  I will tell of all your marvelous works.
009:002 I will be glad and rejoice in you.  I will sing praise to your name,
        O Most High.
009:003 When my enemies turn back, they stumble and perish in your presence.
009:004 For you have maintained my just cause.  You sit on the
        throne judging righteously.
009:005 You have rebuked the nations.  You have destroyed the wicked.
        You have blotted out their name forever and ever.
009:006 The enemy is overtaken by endless ruin.  The very memory
        of the cities which you have overthrown has perished.
009:007 But Yahweh reigns forever.  He has prepared his throne for judgment.
009:008 He will judge the world in righteousness.  He will administer
        judgment to the peoples in uprightness.
009:009 Yahweh will also be a high tower for the oppressed; a high
        tower in times of trouble.
009:010 Those who know your name will put their trust in you,
        for you, Yahweh, have not forsaken those who seek you.
009:011 Sing praises to Yahweh, who dwells in Zion, and declare among
        the people what he has done.
009:012 For he who avenges blood remembers them.  He doesn't forget
        the cry of the afflicted.
009:013 Have mercy on me, Yahweh.  See my affliction by those who hate me,
        and lift me up from the gates of death;
009:014 that I may show forth all your praise.  In the gates of
        the daughter of Zion, I will rejoice in your salvation.
009:015 The nations have sunk down in the pit that they made.
        In the net which they hid, their own foot is taken.
009:016 Yahweh has made himself known.  He has executed judgment.  The wicked
        is snared by the work of his own hands.  Meditation.  Selah.
009:017 The wicked shall be turned back to Sheol, even all the nations
        that forget God.
009:018 For the needy shall not always be forgotten, nor the hope
        of the poor perish forever.
009:019 Arise, Yahweh!  Don't let man prevail.  Let the nations be
        judged in your sight.
009:020 Put them in fear, Yahweh.  Let the nations know that they
        are only men.  Selah.
010:001 Why do you stand far off, Yahweh?  Why do you hide yourself
        in times of trouble?
010:002 In arrogance, the wicked hunt down the weak.  They are caught
        in the schemes that they devise.
010:003 For the wicked boasts of his heart's cravings.  He blesses
        the greedy, and condemns Yahweh.
010:004 The wicked, in the pride of his face, has no room in his
        thoughts for God.
010:005 His ways are prosperous at all times.  He is haughty, and your
        laws are far from his sight.  As for all his adversaries,
        he sneers at them.
010:006 He says in his heart, "I shall not be shaken.  For generations
        I shall have no trouble."
010:007 His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and oppression.
        Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.
010:008 He lies in wait near the villages.  From ambushes, he murders
        the innocent.  His eyes are secretly set against the helpless.
010:009 He lurks in secret as a lion in his ambush.  He lies in wait
        to catch the helpless.  He catches the helpless, when he draws
        him in his net.
010:010 The helpless are crushed.  They collapse.  They fall
        under his strength.
010:011 He says in his heart, "God has forgotten.  He hides his face.
        He will never see it."
010:012 Arise, Yahweh!  God, lift up your hand!  Don't forget the helpless.
010:013 Why does the wicked person condemn God, and say in his heart,
        "God won't call me into account?"
010:014 But you do see trouble and grief.  You consider it to take it
        into your hand.  You help the victim and the fatherless.
010:015 Break the arm of the wicked.  As for the evil man, seek out
        his wickedness until you find none.
010:016 Yahweh is King forever and ever!  The nations will perish
        out of his land.
010:017 Yahweh, you have heard the desire of the humble.
        You will prepare their heart.  You will cause your ear to hear,
010:018 to judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that man who is
        of the earth may terrify no more.
011:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  By David.>> In Yahweh, I take refuge.
        How can you say to my soul, "Flee as a bird to your mountain!"
011:002 For, behold, the wicked bend their bows.  They set their
        arrows on the strings, that they may shoot in darkness at
        the upright in heart.
011:003 If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?
011:004 Yahweh is in his holy temple.  Yahweh is on his throne in heaven.
        His eyes observe.  His eyes examine the children of men.
011:005 Yahweh examines the righteous, but the wicked and him who loves
        violence his soul hates.
011:006 On the wicked he will rain blazing coals; fire, sulfur,
        and scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup.
011:007 For Yahweh is righteous.  He loves righteousness.
        The upright shall see his face.
012:001 <<For the Chief Musician; upon an eight-stringed lyre.
        A Psalm of David.>> Help, Yahweh; for the godly man ceases.
        For the faithful fail from among the children of men.
012:002 Everyone lies to his neighbor.  They speak with flattering lips,
        and with a double heart.
012:003 May Yahweh cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that boasts,
012:004 who have said, "With our tongue we will prevail.
        Our lips are our own.  Who is lord over us?"
012:005 "Because of the oppression of the weak and because of the groaning
        of the needy, I will now arise," says Yahweh; "I will set
        him in safety from those who malign him."
012:006 The words of Yahweh are flawless words, as silver refined
        in a clay furnace, purified seven times.
012:007 You will keep them, Yahweh.  You will preserve them from
        this generation forever.
012:008 The wicked walk on every side, when what is vile is exalted
        among the sons of men.
013:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by David.>>
        How long, Yahweh?  Will you forget me forever?
        How long will you hide your face from me?
013:002 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my
        heart every day?  How long shall my enemy triumph over me?
013:003 Behold, and answer me, Yahweh, my God.  Give light to my eyes,
        lest I sleep in death;
013:004 Lest my enemy say, "I have prevailed against him;" Lest my
        adversaries rejoice when I fall.
013:005 But I trust in your loving kindness.  My heart rejoices
        in your salvation.
013:006 I will sing to Yahweh, because he has been good to me.
014:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  By David.>> The fool has said
        in his heart, "There is no God."  They are corrupt.
        They have done abominable works.  There is none who does good.
014:002 Yahweh looked down from heaven on the children of men, to see
        if there were any who did understand, who did seek after God.
014:003 They have all gone aside.  They have together become corrupt.
        There is none who does good, no, not one.
014:004 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, who eat up
        my people as they eat bread, and don't call on Yahweh?
014:005 There they were in great fear, for God is in the generation
        of the righteous.
014:006 You frustrate the plan of the poor, because Yahweh is his refuge.
014:007 Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion!  When Yahweh
        restores the fortunes of his people, then Jacob shall rejoice,
        and Israel shall be glad.
015:001 <<A Psalm by David.>> Yahweh, who shall dwell in your sanctuary?
        Who shall live on your holy hill?
015:002 He who walks blamelessly does what is right, and speaks truth
        in his heart;
015:003 He who doesn't slander with his tongue, nor does evil to his friend,
        nor casts slurs against his fellow man;
015:004 In whose eyes a vile man is despised, but who honors those
        who fear Yahweh; he who keeps an oath even when it hurts,
        and doesn't change;
015:005 he who doesn't lend out his money for usury, nor take a bribe
        against the innocent.  He who does these things shall
        never be shaken.
016:001 <<A Poem by David.>> Preserve me, God, for in you do I take refuge.
016:002 My soul, you have said to Yahweh, "You are my Lord.
        Apart from you I have no good thing."
016:003 As for the saints who are in the earth, they are the excellent
        ones in whom is all my delight.
016:004 Their sorrows shall be multiplied who give gifts to another god.
        Their drink offerings of blood I will not offer, nor take
        their names on my lips.
016:005 Yahweh assigned my portion and my cup.  You made my lot secure.
016:006 The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places.  Yes, I have
        a good inheritance.
016:007 I will bless Yahweh, who has given me counsel.  Yes, my heart
        instructs me in the night seasons.
016:008 I have set Yahweh always before me.  Because he is at my right hand,
        I shall not be moved.
016:009 Therefore my heart is glad, and my tongue rejoices.
        My body shall also dwell in safety.
016:010 For you will not leave my soul in Sheol, neither will you
        allow your holy one to see corruption.
016:011 You will show me the path of life.  In your presence is fullness
        of joy.  In your right hand there are pleasures forevermore.
017:001 <<A Prayer by David.>> Hear, Yahweh, my righteous plea;
        Give ear to my prayer, that doesn't go out of deceitful lips.
017:002 Let my sentence come forth from your presence.  Let your eyes
        look on equity.
017:003 You have proved my heart.  You have visited me in the night.
        You have tried me, and found nothing.  I have resolved that my
        mouth shall not disobey.
017:004 As for the works of men, by the word of your lips, I have kept
        myself from the ways of the violent.
017:005 My steps have held fast to your paths.  My feet have not slipped.
017:006 I have called on you, for you will answer me, God.  Turn your
        ear to me.  Hear my speech.
017:007 Show your marvelous loving kindness, you who save those who take
        refuge by your right hand from their enemies.
017:008 Keep me as the apple of your eye.  Hide me under the shadow
        of your wings,
017:009 from the wicked who oppress me, my deadly enemies,
        who surround me.
017:010 They close up their callous hearts.  With their mouth
        they speak proudly.
017:011 They have now surrounded us in our steps.  They set their eyes
        to cast us down to the earth.
017:012 He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey, as it were a young
        lion lurking in secret places.
017:013 Arise, Yahweh, confront him.  Cast him down.  Deliver my soul
        from the wicked by your sword;
017:014 from men by your hand, Yahweh, from men of the world, whose portion
        is in this life.  You fill the belly of your cherished ones.
        Your sons have plenty, and they store up wealth for their children.
017:015 As for me, I shall see your face in righteousness.
        I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with seeing your form.
018:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  By David the servant of Yahweh, who spoke
        to Yahweh the words of this song in the day that Yahweh delivered
        him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul.
        He said,>> I love you, Yahweh, my strength.
018:002 Yahweh is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my rock,
        in whom I take refuge; my shield, and the horn of my salvation,
        my high tower.
018:003 I call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised; and I am saved
        from my enemies.
018:004 The cords of death surrounded me.  The floods of ungodliness
        made me afraid.
018:005 The cords of Sheol were around me.  The snares of death
        came on me.
018:006 In my distress I called on Yahweh, and cried to my God.
        He heard my voice out of his temple.  My cry before him came
        into his ears.
018:007 Then the earth shook and trembled.  The foundations also of
        the mountains quaked and were shaken, because he was angry.
018:008 Smoke went out of his nostrils.  Consuming fire came out
        of his mouth.  Coals were kindled by it.
018:009 He bowed the heavens also, and came down.  Thick darkness
        was under his feet.
018:010 He rode on a cherub, and flew.  Yes, he soared on the wings
        of the wind.
018:011 He made darkness his hiding place, his pavilion around him,
        darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.
018:012 At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed,
        hailstones and coals of fire.
018:013 Yahweh also thundered in the sky.  The Most High uttered his voice:
        hailstones and coals of fire.
018:014 He sent out his arrows, and scattered them; Yes, great lightning
        bolts, and routed them.
018:015 Then the channels of waters appeared.  The foundations of
        the world were laid bare at your rebuke, Yahweh, at the blast
        of the breath of your nostrils.
018:016 He sent from on high.  He took me.  He drew me out of many waters.
018:017 He delivered me from my strong enemy, from those who hated me;
        for they were too mighty for me.
018:018 They came on me in the day of my calamity, but Yahweh
        was my support.
018:019 He brought me forth also into a large place.  He delivered me,
        because he delighted in me.
018:020 Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness.
        According to the cleanness of my hands has he recompensed me.
018:021 For I have kept the ways of Yahweh, and have not wickedly
        departed from my God.
018:022 For all his ordinances were before me.  I didn't put away
        his statutes from me.
018:023 I was also blameless with him.  I kept myself from my iniquity.
018:024 Therefore Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness,
        according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.
018:025 With the merciful you will show yourself merciful.
        With the perfect man, you will show yourself perfect.
018:026 With the pure, you will show yourself pure.  With the crooked
        you will show yourself shrewd.
018:027 For you will save the afflicted people, but the haughty eyes
        you will bring down.
018:028 For you will light my lamp, Yahweh.  My God will light
        up my darkness.
018:029 For by you, I advance through a troop.  By my God, I leap
        over a wall.
018:030 As for God, his way is perfect.  The word of Yahweh is tried.
        He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.
018:031 For who is God, except Yahweh?  Who is a rock, besides our God,
018:032 the God who arms me with strength, and makes my way perfect?
018:033 He makes my feet like deer's feet, and sets me on my high places.
018:034 He teaches my hands to war, so that my arms bend a bow of bronze.
018:035 You have also given me the shield of your salvation.
        Your right hand sustains me.  Your gentleness has made me great.
018:036 You have enlarged my steps under me, My feet have not slipped.
018:037 I will pursue my enemies, and overtake them.  Neither will I
        turn again until they are consumed.
018:038 I will strike them through, so that they will not be able to rise.
        They shall fall under my feet.
018:039 For you have girded me with strength to the battle.
        You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.
018:040 You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, that I
        might cut off those who hate me.
018:041 They cried, but there was none to save; even to Yahweh,
        but he didn't answer them.
018:042 Then I beat them small as the dust before the wind.
        I cast them out as the mire of the streets.
018:043 You have delivered me from the strivings of the people.
        You have made me the head of the nations.  A people whom I
        have not known shall serve me.
018:044 As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me.  The foreigners
        shall submit themselves to me.
018:045 The foreigners shall fade away, and shall come trembling out
        of their close places.
018:046 Yahweh lives; and blessed be my rock.  Exalted be the God
        of my salvation,
018:047 even the God who executes vengeance for me, and subdues
        peoples under me.
018:048 He rescues me from my enemies.  Yes, you lift me up above those
        who rise up against me.  You deliver me from the violent man.
018:049 Therefore I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations,
        and will sing praises to your name.
018:050 He gives great deliverance to his king, and shows loving kindness
        to his anointed, to David and to his seed, forevermore.
019:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by David.>> The heavens
        declare the glory of God.  The expanse shows his handiwork.
019:002 Day after day they pour forth speech, and night after night
        they display knowledge.
019:003 There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.
019:004 Their voice has gone out through all the earth, their words
        to the end of the world.  In them he has set a tent for the sun,
019:005 which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, like a strong
        man rejoicing to run his course.
019:006 His going forth is from the end of the heavens, his circuit
        to its ends; There is nothing hidden from its heat.
019:007 Yahweh's law is perfect, restoring the soul.  Yahweh's testimony
        is sure, making wise the simple.
019:008 Yahweh's precepts are right, rejoicing the heart.
        Yahweh's commandment is pure, enlightening the eyes.
019:009 The fear of Yahweh is clean, enduring forever.
        Yahweh's ordinances are true, and righteous altogether.
019:010 More to be desired are they than gold, yes, than much fine gold;
        sweeter also than honey and the extract of the honeycomb.
019:011 Moreover by them is your servant warned.  In keeping them
        there is great reward.
019:012 Who can discern his errors?  Forgive me from hidden errors.
019:013 Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins.
        Let them not have dominion over me.  Then I will be upright.
        I will be blameless and innocent of great transgression.
019:014 Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be
        acceptable in your sight, Yahweh, my rock, and my redeemer.
020:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by David.>> May Yahweh
        answer you in the day of trouble.  May the name of the God
        of Jacob set you up on high,
020:002 send you help from the sanctuary, grant you support from Zion,
020:003 remember all your offerings, and accept your burnt sacrifice.  Selah.
020:004 May He grant you your heart's desire, and fulfill all your counsel.
020:005 We will triumph in your salvation.  In the name of our God,
        we will set up our banners.  May Yahweh grant all your requests.
020:006 Now I know that Yahweh saves his anointed.  He will answer him
        from his holy heaven, with the saving strength of his right hand.
020:007 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses, but we trust
        the name of Yahweh our God.
020:008 They are bowed down and fallen, but we rise up, and stand upright.
020:009 Save, Yahweh!  Let the King answer us when we call!
021:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by David.>> The king
        rejoices in your strength, Yahweh!  How greatly he rejoices
        in your salvation!
021:002 You have given him his heart's desire, and have not withheld
        the request of his lips.  Selah.
021:003 For you meet him with the blessings of goodness.
        You set a crown of fine gold on his head.
021:004 He asked life of you, you gave it to him, even length of days
        forever and ever.
021:005 His glory is great in your salvation.  You lay honor and
        majesty on him.
021:006 For you make him most blessed forever.  You make him glad
        with joy in your presence.
021:007 For the king trusts in Yahweh.  Through the loving kindness
        of the Most High, he shall not be moved.
021:008 Your hand will find out all of your enemies.  Your right hand
        will find out those who hate you.
021:009 You will make them as a fiery furnace in the time of your anger.
        Yahweh will swallow them up in his wrath.  The fire
        shall devour them.
021:010 You will destroy their descendants from the earth, their posterity
        from among the children of men.
021:011 For they intended evil against you.  They plotted evil against
        you which cannot succeed.
021:012 For you will make them turn their back, when you aim drawn
        bows at their face.
021:013 Be exalted, Yahweh, in your strength, so we will sing and
        praise your power.
022:001 <<For the Chief Musician; set to "The Doe of the Morning."
        A Psalm by David.>> My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
        Why are you so far from helping me, and from the words
        of my groaning?
022:002 My God, I cry in the daytime, but you don't answer;
        in the night season, and am not silent.
022:003 But you are holy, you who inhabit the praises of Israel.
022:004 Our fathers trusted in you.  They trusted, and you delivered them.
022:005 They cried to you, and were delivered.  They trusted in you,
        and were not disappointed.
022:006 But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised
        by the people.
022:007 All those who see me mock me.  They insult me with their lips.
        They shake their heads, saying,
022:008 "He trusts in Yahweh; let him deliver him.  Let him rescue him,
        since he delights in him."
022:009 But you brought me out of the womb.  You made me trust at
        my mother's breasts.
022:010 I was thrown on you from my mother's womb.  You are my God
        since my mother bore me.
022:011 Don't be far from me, for trouble is near.  For there is
        none to help.
022:012 Many bulls have surrounded me.  Strong bulls of Bashan
        have encircled me.
022:013 They open their mouths wide against me, lions tearing
        prey and roaring.
022:014 I am poured out like water.  All my bones are out of joint.
        My heart is like wax; it is melted within me.
022:015 My strength is dried up like a potsherd.  My tongue sticks
        to the roof of my mouth.  You have brought me into the
        dust of death.
022:016 For dogs have surrounded me.  A company of evil-doers have
        enclosed me.  Like a lion, they pin my hands and feet.{or,
        They have pierced my hands and feet.  (DSS)}
022:017 I can count all of my bones.  They look and stare at me.
022:018 They divide my garments among them.  They cast lots for my clothing.
022:019 But don't be far off, Yahweh.  You are my help:
        hurry to help me.
022:020 Deliver my soul from the sword, my precious life from the power
        of the dog.
022:021 Save me from the lion's mouth!  Yes, from the horns of the wild oxen,
        you have answered me.
022:022 I will declare your name to my brothers.  In the midst
        of the assembly, I will praise you.
022:023 You who fear Yahweh, praise him!  All you descendants of Jacob,
        glorify him!  Stand in awe of him, all you descendants of Israel!
022:024 For he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of
        the afflicted, Neither has he hidden his face from him;
        but when he cried to him, he heard.
022:025 Of you comes my praise in the great assembly.  I will pay
        my vows before those who fear him.
022:026 The humble shall eat and be satisfied.  They shall praise
        Yahweh who seek after him.  Let your hearts live forever.
022:027 All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to Yahweh.
        All the relatives of the nations shall worship before you.
022:028 For the kingdom is Yahweh's. He is the ruler over the nations.
022:029 All the rich ones of the earth shall eat and worship.
        All those who go down to the dust shall bow before him,
        even he who can't keep his soul alive.
022:030 Posterity shall serve him.  Future generations shall be told
        about the Lord.
022:031 They shall come and shall declare his righteousness to a people
        that shall be born, for he has done it.
023:001 <<A Psalm by David.>> Yahweh is my shepherd:  I shall lack nothing.
023:002 He makes me lie down in green pastures.  He leads me
        beside still waters.
023:003 He restores my soul.  He guides me in the paths of righteousness
        for his name's sake.
023:004 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
        I will fear no evil, for you are with me.  Your rod and your staff,
        they comfort me.
023:005 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.
        You anoint my head with oil.  My cup runs over.
023:006 Surely goodness and loving kindness shall follow me all the days
        of my life, and I will dwell in Yahweh's house forever.
024:001 <<A Psalm by David.>> The earth is Yahweh's, with its fullness;
        the world, and those who dwell therein.
024:002 For he has founded it on the seas, and established it
        on the floods.
024:003 Who may ascend to Yahweh's hill?  Who may stand in his holy place?
024:004 He who has clean hands and a pure heart; who has not lifted
        up his soul to falsehood, and has not sworn deceitfully.
024:005 He shall receive a blessing from Yahweh, righteousness from
        the God of his salvation.
024:006 This is the generation of those who seek Him, who seek your face--
        even Jacob.  Selah.
024:007 Lift up your heads, you gates!  Be lifted up, you everlasting doors,
        and the King of glory will come in.
024:008 Who is the King of glory?  Yahweh strong and mighty,
        Yahweh mighty in battle.
024:009 Lift up your heads, you gates; yes, lift them up,
        you everlasting doors, and the King of glory will come in.
024:010 Who is this King of glory?  Yahweh of Armies is the King
        of glory!  Selah.
025:001 <<By David.>> To you, Yahweh, do I lift up my soul.
025:002 My God, I have trusted in you.  Don't let me be shamed.
        Don't let my enemies triumph over me.
025:003 Yes, no one who waits for you shall be shamed.  They shall
        be shamed who deal treacherously without cause.
025:004 Show me your ways, Yahweh.  Teach me your paths.
025:005 Guide me in your truth, and teach me, For you are the God
        of my salvation, I wait for you all day long.
025:006 Yahweh, remember your tender mercies and your loving kindness,
        for they are from old times.
025:007 Don't remember the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions.
        Remember me according to your loving kindness,
        for your goodness' sake, Yahweh.
025:008 Good and upright is Yahweh, therefore he will instruct sinners
        in the way.
025:009 He will guide the humble in justice.  He will teach
        the humble his way.
025:010 All the paths of Yahweh are loving kindness and truth to such
        as keep his covenant and his testimonies.
025:011 For your name's sake, Yahweh, pardon my iniquity, for it is great.
025:012 What man is he who fears Yahweh?  He shall instruct him
        in the way that he shall choose.
025:013 His soul shall dwell at ease.  His seed shall inherit the land.
025:014 The friendship of Yahweh is with those who fear him.
        He will show them his covenant.
025:015 My eyes are ever on Yahweh, for he will pluck my feet out
        of the net.
025:016 Turn to me, and have mercy on me, for I am desolate and afflicted.
025:017 The troubles of my heart are enlarged.  Oh bring me out
        of my distresses.
025:018 Consider my affliction and my travail.  Forgive all my sins.
025:019 Consider my enemies, for they are many.  They hate me
        with cruel hatred.
025:020 Oh keep my soul, and deliver me.  Let me not be disappointed,
        for I take refuge in you.
025:021 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, for I wait for you.
025:022 Redeem Israel, God, out all of his troubles.
026:001 <<By David.>> Judge me, Yahweh, for I have walked in my integrity.
        I have trusted also in Yahweh without wavering.
026:002 Examine me, Yahweh, and prove me.  Try my heart and my mind.
026:003 For your loving kindness is before my eyes.  I have walked
        in your truth.
026:004 I have not sat with deceitful men, neither will I go
        in with hypocrites.
026:005 I hate the assembly of evil-doers, and will not sit with the wicked.
026:006 I will wash my hands in innocence, so I will go about
        your altar, Yahweh;
026:007 that I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard,
        and tell of all your wondrous works.
026:008 Yahweh, I love the habitation of your house, the place where
        your glory dwells.
026:009 Don't gather my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloodthirsty men;
026:010 in whose hands is wickedness, their right hand is full of bribes.
026:011 But as for me, I will walk in my integrity.  Redeem me,
        and be merciful to me.
026:012 My foot stands in an even place.  In the congregations I
        will bless Yahweh.
027:001 <<By David.>> Yahweh is my light and my salvation.
        Whom shall I fear?  Yahweh is the strength of my life.
        Of whom shall I be afraid?
027:002 When evil-doers came at me to eat up my flesh, even my adversaries
        and my foes, they stumbled and fell.
027:003 Though an army should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear.
        Though war should rise against me, even then I will be confident.
027:004 One thing I have asked of Yahweh, that I will seek after,
        that I may dwell in the house of Yahweh all the days of my life,
        to see Yahweh's beauty, and to inquire in his temple.
027:005 For in the day of trouble he will keep me secretly in his pavilion.
        In the covert of his tent he will hide me.  He will lift me
        up on a rock.
027:006 Now my head will be lifted up above my enemies around me.
        I will offer sacrifices of joy in his tent.  I will sing,
        yes, I will sing praises to Yahweh.
027:007 Hear, Yahweh, when I cry with my voice.  Have mercy also on me,
        and answer me.
027:008 When you said, "Seek my face," my heart said to you, "I will
        seek your face, Yahweh."
027:009 Don't hide your face from me.  Don't put your servant away in anger.
        You have been my help.  Don't abandon me, neither forsake me,
        God of my salvation.
027:010 When my father and my mother forsake me, then Yahweh will
        take me up.
027:011 Teach me your way, Yahweh.  Lead me in a straight path,
        because of my enemies.
027:012 Don't deliver me over to the desire of my adversaries, for false
        witnesses have risen up against me, such as breathe out cruelty.
027:013 I am still confident of this:  I will see the goodness of Yahweh
        in the land of the living.
027:014 Wait for Yahweh.  Be strong, and let your heart take courage.
        Yes, wait for Yahweh.
028:001 <<By David.>> To you, Yahweh, I call.  My rock, don't be
        deaf to me; lest, if you are silent to me, I would become
        like those who go down into the pit.
028:002 Hear the voice of my petitions, when I cry to you, when I lift
        up my hands toward your Most Holy Place.
028:003 Don't draw me away with the wicked, with the workers of
        iniquity who speak peace with their neighbors, but mischief
        is in their hearts.
028:004 Give them according to their work, and according to the wickedness of
        their doings.  Give them according to the operation of their hands.
        Bring back on them what they deserve.
028:005 Because they don't regard the works of Yahweh, nor the operation
        of his hands, he will break them down and not build them up.
028:006 Blessed be Yahweh, because he has heard the voice of my petitions.
028:007 Yahweh is my strength and my shield.  My heart has trusted in him,
        and I am helped.  Therefore my heart greatly rejoices.
        With my song I will thank him.
028:008 Yahweh is their strength.  He is a stronghold of salvation
        to his anointed.
028:009 Save your people, and bless your inheritance.  Be their
        shepherd also, and bear them up forever.
029:001 <<A Psalm by David.>> Ascribe to Yahweh, you sons of the mighty,
        ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength.
029:002 Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name.  Worship Yahweh
        in holy array.
029:003 Yahweh's voice is on the waters.  The God of glory thunders,
        even Yahweh on many waters.
029:004 Yahweh's voice is powerful.  Yahweh's voice is full of majesty.
029:005 The voice of Yahweh breaks the cedars.  Yes, Yahweh breaks
        in pieces the cedars of Lebanon.
029:006 He makes them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion
        like a young, wild ox.
029:007 Yahweh's voice strikes with flashes of lightning.
029:008 Yahweh's voice shakes the wilderness.  Yahweh shakes
        the wilderness of Kadesh.
029:009 Yahweh's voice makes the deer calve, and strips the forests bare.
        In his temple everything says, "Glory!"
029:010 Yahweh sat enthroned at the Flood.  Yes, Yahweh sits
        as King forever.
029:011 Yahweh will give strength to his people.  Yahweh will bless
        his people with peace.
030:001 <<A Psalm.  A Song for the Dedication of the Temple.
        By David.>> I will extol you, Yahweh, for you have raised me up,
        and have not made my foes to rejoice over me.
030:002 Yahweh my God, I cried to you, and you have healed me.
030:003 Yahweh, you have brought up my soul from Sheol.
        You have kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.
030:004 Sing praise to Yahweh, you saints of his.  Give thanks
        to his holy name.
030:005 For his anger is but for a moment.  His favor is for a lifetime.
        Weeping may stay for the night, but joy comes in the morning.
030:006 As for me, I said in my prosperity, "I shall never be moved."
030:007 You, Yahweh, when you favored me, made my mountain stand strong;
        but when you hid your face, I was troubled.
030:008 I cried to you, Yahweh.  To Yahweh I made supplication:
030:009 "What profit is there in my destruction, if I go down to the pit?
        Shall the dust praise you?  Shall it declare your truth?
030:010 Hear, Yahweh, and have mercy on me.  Yahweh, be my helper."
030:011 You have turned my mourning into dancing for me.
        You have removed my sackcloth, and clothed me with gladness,
030:012 To the end that my heart may sing praise to you, and not be silent.
        Yahweh my God, I will give thanks to you forever!
031:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by David.>> In you,
        Yahweh, I take refuge.  Let me never be disappointed.
        Deliver me in your righteousness.
031:002 Bow down your ear to me.  Deliver me speedily.  Be to me
        a strong rock, a house of defense to save me.
031:003 For you are my rock and my fortress, therefore for your name's
        sake lead me and guide me.
031:004 Pluck me out of the net that they have laid secretly for me,
        for you are my stronghold.
031:005 Into your hand I commend my spirit.  You redeem me,
        Yahweh, God of truth.
031:006 I hate those who regard lying vanities, but I trust in Yahweh.
031:007 I will be glad and rejoice in your loving kindness, for you have
        seen my affliction.  You have known my soul in adversities.
031:008 You have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy.
        You have set my feet in a large place.
031:009 Have mercy on me, Yahweh, for I am in distress.  My eye,
        my soul, and my body waste away with grief.
031:010 For my life is spent with sorrow, my years with sighing.
        My strength fails because of my iniquity.  My bones
        are wasted away.
031:011 Because of all my adversaries I have become utterly
        contemptible to my neighbors, A fear to my acquaintances.
        Those who saw me on the street fled from me.
031:012 I am forgotten from their hearts like a dead man.
        I am like broken pottery.
031:013 For I have heard the slander of many, terror on every side,
        while they conspire together against me, they plot to take
        away my life.
031:014 But I trust in you, Yahweh.  I said, "You are my God."
031:015 My times are in your hand.  Deliver me from the hand of my enemies,
        and from those who persecute me.
031:016 Make your face to shine on your servant.  Save me in
        your loving kindness.
031:017 Let me not be disappointed, Yahweh, for I have called on you.
        Let the wicked be disappointed.  Let them be silent in Sheol.
031:018 Let the lying lips be mute, which speak against the righteous
        insolently, with pride and contempt.
031:019 Oh how great is your goodness, which you have laid up for
        those who fear you, which you have worked for those who take
        refuge in you, before the sons of men!
031:020 In the shelter of your presence you will hide them from
        the plotting of man.  You will keep them secretly in a dwelling
        away from the strife of tongues.
031:021 Praise be to Yahweh, for he has shown me his marvelous loving
        kindness in a strong city.
031:022 As for me, I said in my haste, "I am cut off from before your eyes."
        Nevertheless you heard the voice of my petitions when I
        cried to you.
031:023 Oh love Yahweh, all you his saints!  Yahweh preserves the faithful,
        and fully recompenses him who behaves arrogantly.
031:024 Be strong, and let your heart take courage, all you who
        hope in Yahweh.
032:001 <<By David.  A contemplative psalm.>> Blessed is he whose
        disobedience is forgiven, whose sin is covered.
032:002 Blessed is the man to whom Yahweh doesn't impute iniquity,
        in whose spirit there is no deceit.
032:003 When I kept silence, my bones wasted away through my groaning
        all day long.
032:004 For day and night your hand was heavy on me.  My strength
        was sapped in the heat of summer.  Selah.
032:005 I acknowledged my sin to you.  I didn't hide my iniquity.
        I said, I will confess my transgressions to Yahweh, and you
        forgave the iniquity of my sin.  Selah.
032:006 For this, let everyone who is godly pray to you in a time
        when you may be found.  Surely when the great waters overflow,
        they shall not reach to him.
032:007 You are my hiding place.  You will preserve me from trouble.
        You will surround me with songs of deliverance.  Selah.
032:008 I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you shall go.
        I will counsel you with my eye on you.
032:009 Don't be like the horse, or like the mule, which have
        no understanding, who are controlled by bit and bridle,
        or else they will not come near to you.
032:010 Many sorrows come to the wicked, but loving kindness shall
        surround him who trusts in Yahweh.
032:011 Be glad in Yahweh, and rejoice, you righteous!  Shout for joy,
        all you who are upright in heart!
033:001 Rejoice in Yahweh, you righteous!  Praise is fitting
        for the upright.
033:002 Give thanks to Yahweh with the lyre.  Sing praises to him
        with the harp of ten strings.
033:003 Sing to him a new song.  Play skillfully with a shout of joy!
033:004 For the word of Yahweh is right.  All his work is
        done in faithfulness.
033:005 He loves righteousness and justice.  The earth is full
        of the loving kindness of Yahweh.
033:006 By Yahweh's word, the heavens were made; all their army
        by the breath of his mouth.
033:007 He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap.
        He lays up the deeps in storehouses.
033:008 Let all the earth fear Yahweh.  Let all the inhabitants
        of the world stand in awe of him.
033:009 For he spoke, and it was done.  He commanded, and it stood firm.
033:010 Yahweh brings the counsel of the nations to nothing.
        He makes the thoughts of the peoples to be of no effect.
033:011 The counsel of Yahweh stands fast forever, the thoughts of his
        heart to all generations.
033:012 Blessed is the nation whose God is Yahweh, the people whom
        he has chosen for his own inheritance.
033:013 Yahweh looks from heaven.  He sees all the sons of men.
033:014 From the place of his habitation he looks out on all the inhabitants
        of the earth,
033:015 he who fashions all of their hearts; and he considers all
        of their works.
033:016 There is no king saved by the multitude of an army.
        A mighty man is not delivered by great strength.
033:017 A horse is a vain thing for safety, neither does he deliver
        any by his great power.
033:018 Behold, Yahweh's eye is on those who fear him, on those who hope
        in his loving kindness;
033:019 to deliver their soul from death, to keep them alive in famine.
033:020 Our soul has waited for Yahweh.  He is our help and our shield.
033:021 For our heart rejoices in him, because we have trusted
        in his holy name.
033:022 Let your loving kindness be on us, Yahweh, since we have hoped
        in you.  {}
034:001 <<By David; when he pretended to be insane before Abimelech,
        who drove him away, and he departed.Psalm 34 is an acrostic poem,
        with each verse starting with a letter of the alphabet
        (ordered from Alef to Tav).>> I will bless Yahweh at all times.
        His praise will always be in my mouth.
034:002 My soul shall boast in Yahweh.  The humble shall hear of it,
        and be glad.
034:003 Oh magnify Yahweh with me.  Let us exalt his name together.
034:004 I sought Yahweh, and he answered me, and delivered me from
        all my fears.
034:005 They looked to him, and were radiant.  Their faces shall
        never be covered with shame.
034:006 This poor man cried, and Yahweh heard him, and saved him out
        of all his troubles.
034:007 The angel of Yahweh encamps round about those who fear him,
        and delivers them.
034:008 Oh taste and see that Yahweh is good.  Blessed is the man
        who takes refuge in him.
034:009 Oh fear Yahweh, you his saints, for there is no lack with
        those who fear him.
034:010 The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger, but those who seek
        Yahweh shall not lack any good thing.
034:011 Come, you children, listen to me.  I will teach you
        the fear of Yahweh.
034:012 Who is someone who desires life, and loves many days,
        that he may see good?
034:013 Keep your tongue from evil, and your lips from speaking lies.
034:014 Depart from evil, and do good.  seek peace, and pursue it.
034:015 Yahweh's eyes are toward the righteous.  His ears listen
        to their cry.
034:016 Yahweh's face is against those who do evil, to cut off the memory
        of them from the earth.
034:017 The righteous cry, and Yahweh hears, and delivers them out
        of all their troubles.
034:018 Yahweh is near to those who have a broken heart, and saves
        those who have a crushed spirit.
034:019 Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but Yahweh delivers
        him out of them all.
034:020 He protects all of his bones.  Not one of them is broken.
034:021 Evil shall kill the wicked.  Those who hate the righteous
        shall be condemned.
034:022 Yahweh redeems the soul of his servants.  None of those who take
        refuge in him shall be condemned.
035:001 <<By David.>> Contend, Yahweh, with those who contend with me.
        Fight against those who fight against me.
035:002 Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for my help.
035:003 Brandish the spear and block those who pursue me.
        Tell my soul, "I am your salvation."
035:004 Let those who seek after my soul be disappointed and brought
        to dishonor.  Let those who plot my ruin be turned
        back and confounded.
035:005 Let them be as chaff before the wind, Yahweh's angel
        driving them on.
035:006 Let their way be dark and slippery, Yahweh's angel pursuing them.
035:007 For without cause they have hidden their net in a pit for me.
        Without cause they have dug a pit for my soul.
035:008 Let destruction come on him unawares.  Let his net that he has
        hidden catch himself.  Let him fall into that destruction.
035:009 My soul shall be joyful in Yahweh.  It shall rejoice
        in his salvation.
035:010 All my bones shall say, "Yahweh, who is like you, who delivers
        the poor from him who is too strong for him; yes, the poor
        and the needy from him who robs him?"
035:011 Unrighteous witnesses rise up.  They ask me about things that I
        don't know about.
035:012 They reward me evil for good, to the bereaving of my soul.
035:013 But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth.
        I afflicted my soul with fasting.  My prayer returned into
        my own bosom.
035:014 I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother.
        I bowed down mourning, as one who mourns his mother.
035:015 But in my adversity, they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together.
        The attackers gathered themselves together against me,
        and I didn't know it.  They tore at me, and didn't cease.
035:016 Like the profane mockers in feasts, they gnashed their
        teeth at me.
035:017 Lord, how long will you look on?  Rescue my soul from
        their destruction, my precious life from the lions.
035:018 I will give you thanks in the great assembly.  I will praise
        you among many people.
035:019 Don't let those who are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me;
        neither let those who hate me without a cause wink their eyes.
035:020 For they don't speak peace, but they devise deceitful words
        against those who are quiet in the land.
035:021 Yes, they opened their mouth wide against me.
        They said, "Aha!  Aha!  Our eye has seen it!"
035:022 You have seen it, Yahweh.  Don't keep silent.  Lord, don't be
        far from me.
035:023 Wake up!  Rise up to defend me, my God!  My Lord, contend for me!
035:024 Vindicate me, Yahweh my God, according to your righteousness.
        Don't let them gloat over me.
035:025 Don't let them say in their heart, "Aha!  That's the way we want it!"
        Don't let them say, "We have swallowed him up!"
035:026 Let them be disappointed and confounded together who rejoice
        at my calamity.  Let them be clothed with shame and dishonor
        who magnify themselves against me.
035:027 Let them shout for joy and be glad, who favor my righteous cause.
        Yes, let them say continually, "Yahweh be magnified, who has
        pleasure in the prosperity of his servant!"
035:028 My tongue shall talk about your righteousness and about your
        praise all day long.
036:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  By David, the servant of Yahweh.>> An
        oracle is within my heart about the disobedience of the wicked:
        "There is no fear of God before his eyes."
036:002 For he flatters himself in his own eyes, too much to detect
        and hate his sin.
036:003 The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit.
        He has ceased to be wise and to do good.
036:004 He plots iniquity on his bed.  He sets himself in a way that is
        not good.  He doesn't abhor evil.
036:005 Your loving kindness, Yahweh, is in the heavens.
        Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.
036:006 Your righteousness is like the mountains of God.
        Your judgments are like a great deep.  Yahweh, you preserve
        man and animal.
036:007 How precious is your loving kindness, God!  The children of men
        take refuge under the shadow of your wings.
036:008 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the abundance of your house.
        You will make them drink of the river of your pleasures.
036:009 For with you is the spring of life.  In your light shall
        we see light.
036:010 Oh continue your loving kindness to those who know you,
        your righteousness to the upright in heart.
036:011 Don't let the foot of pride come against me.  Don't let the hand
        of the wicked drive me away.
036:012 There the workers of iniquity are fallen.  They are thrust down,
        and shall not be able to rise.
037:001 <<By David.>> Don't fret because of evil-doers, neither be
        envious against those who work unrighteousness.
037:002 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither
        like the green herb.
037:003 Trust in Yahweh, and do good.  Dwell in the land,
        and enjoy safe pasture.
037:004 Also delight yourself in Yahweh, and he will give you the desires
        of your heart.
037:005 Commit your way to Yahweh.  Trust also in him, and he will do this:
037:006 he will make your righteousness go forth as the light,
        and your justice as the noon day sun.
037:007 Rest in Yahweh, and wait patiently for him.  Don't fret
        because of him who prospers in his way, because of the man
        who makes wicked plots happen.
037:008 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath.  Don't fret, it leads
        only to evildoing.
037:009 For evildoers shall be cut off, but those who wait for Yahweh
        shall inherit the land.
037:010 For yet a little while, and the wicked will be no more.
        Yes, though you look for his place, he isn't there.
037:011 But the humble shall inherit the land, and shall delight
        themselves in the abundance of peace.
037:012 The wicked plots against the just, and gnashes at him
        with his teeth.
037:013 The Lord will laugh at him, for he sees that his day is coming.
037:014 The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow,
        to cast down the poor and needy, to kill those who are upright
        in the way.
037:015 Their sword shall enter into their own heart.  Their bows
        shall be broken.
037:016 Better is a little that the righteous has, than the abundance
        of many wicked.
037:017 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken, but Yahweh
        upholds the righteous.
037:018 Yahweh knows the days of the perfect.  Their inheritance
        shall be forever.
037:019 They shall not be disappointed in the time of evil.
        In the days of famine they shall be satisfied.
037:020 But the wicked shall perish.  The enemies of Yahweh shall
        be like the beauty of the fields.  They will vanish--
        vanish like smoke.
037:021 The wicked borrow, and don't pay back, but the righteous
        give generously.
037:022 For such as are blessed by him shall inherit the land.
        Those who are cursed by him shall be cut off.
037:023 A man's goings are established by Yahweh.  He delights
        in his way.
037:024 Though he stumble, he shall not fall, for Yahweh holds him up
        with his hand.
037:025 I have been young, and now am old, yet I have not seen
        the righteous forsaken, nor his children begging for bread.
037:026 All day long he deals graciously, and lends.  His seed is blessed.
037:027 Depart from evil, and do good.  Live securely forever.
037:028 For Yahweh loves justice, and doesn't forsake his saints.
        They are preserved forever, but the children of the wicked
        shall be cut off.
037:029 The righteous shall inherit the land, and live in it forever.
037:030 The mouth of the righteous talks of wisdom.
        His tongue speaks justice.
037:031 The law of his God is in his heart.  None of his steps shall slide.
037:032 The wicked watches the righteous, and seeks to kill him.
037:033 Yahweh will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when
        he is judged.
037:034 Wait for Yahweh, and keep his way, and he will exalt
        you to inherit the land.  When the wicked are cut off,
        you shall see it.
037:035 I have seen the wicked in great power, spreading himself
        like a green tree in its native soil.
037:036 But he passed away, and behold, he was not.  Yes, I sought him,
        but he could not be found.
037:037 Mark the perfect man, and see the upright, for there is a future
        for the man of peace.
037:038 As for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together.
        The future of the wicked shall be cut off.
037:039 But the salvation of the righteous is from Yahweh.
        He is their stronghold in the time of trouble.
037:040 Yahweh helps them, and rescues them.  He rescues them from the wicked,
        and saves them, Because they have taken refuge in him.
038:001 <<A Psalm by David, for a memorial.>> Yahweh, don't rebuke me
        in your wrath, neither chasten me in your hot displeasure.
038:002 For your arrows have pierced me, your hand presses hard on me.
038:003 There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation,
        neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin.
038:004 For my iniquities have gone over my head.  As a heavy burden,
        they are too heavy for me.
038:005 My wounds are loathsome and corrupt, because of my foolishness.
038:006 I am pained and bowed down greatly.  I go mourning all day long.
038:007 For my waist is filled with burning.  There is no soundness
        in my flesh.
038:008 I am faint and severely bruised.  I have groaned by reason
        of the anguish of my heart.
038:009 Lord, all my desire is before you.  My groaning is not
        hidden from you.
038:010 My heart throbs.  My strength fails me.  As for the light
        of my eyes, it has also left me.
038:011 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague.
        My kinsmen stand far away.
038:012 They also who seek after my life lay snares.  Those who seek
        my hurt speak mischievous things, and meditate deceits
        all day long.
038:013 But I, as a deaf man, don't hear.  I am as a mute man who doesn't
        open his mouth.
038:014 Yes, I am as a man who doesn't hear, in whose mouth are no reproofs.
038:015 For in you, Yahweh, do I hope.  You will answer, Lord my God.
038:016 For I said, "Don't let them gloat over me, or exalt themselves
        over me when my foot slips."
038:017 For I am ready to fall.  My pain is continually before me.
038:018 For I will declare my iniquity.  I will be sorry for my sin.
038:019 But my enemies are vigorous and many.  Those who hate me
        without reason are numerous.
038:020 They who also render evil for good are adversaries to me,
        because I follow what is good.
038:021 Don't forsake me, Yahweh.  My God, don't be far from me.
038:022 Hurry to help me, Lord, my salvation.
039:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  For Jeduthun.  A Psalm by David.>> I said,
        "I will watch my ways, so that I don't sin with my tongue.
        I will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked is before me."
039:002 I was mute with silence.  I held my peace, even from good.
        My sorrow was stirred.
039:003 My heart was hot within me.  While I meditated, the fire burned:
        I spoke with my tongue:
039:004 "Yahweh, show me my end, what is the measure of my days.
        Let me know how frail I am.
039:005 Behold, you have made my days handbreadths.  My lifetime
        is as nothing before you.  Surely every man stands as
        a breath."  Selah.
039:006 "Surely every man walks like a shadow.  Surely they busy themselves
        in vain.  He heaps up, and doesn't know who shall gather.
039:007 Now, Lord, what do I wait for?  My hope is in you.
039:008 Deliver me from all my transgressions.  Don't make me the reproach
        of the foolish.
039:009 I was mute.  I didn't open my mouth, because you did it.
039:010 Remove your scourge away from me.  I am overcome by the blow
        of your hand.
039:011 When you rebuke and correct man for iniquity, You consume his
        wealth like a moth.  Surely every man is but a breath."  Selah.
039:012 "Hear my prayer, Yahweh, and give ear to my cry.
        Don't be silent at my tears.  For I am a stranger with you,
        a foreigner, as all my fathers were.
039:013 Oh spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go away,
        and exist no more."
040:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by David.>> I waited
        patiently for Yahweh.  He turned to me, and heard my cry.
040:002 He brought me up also out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay.
        He set my feet on a rock, and gave me a firm place to stand.
040:003 He has put a new song in my mouth, even praise to our God.
        Many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in Yahweh.
040:004 Blessed is the man who makes Yahweh his trust, and doesn't
        respect the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.
040:005 Many, Yahweh, my God, are the wonderful works which you
        have done, and your thoughts which are toward us.
        They can't be declared back to you.  If I would declare
        and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered.
040:006 Sacrifice and offering you didn't desire.  You have opened my ears.
        You have not required burnt offering and sin offering.
040:007 Then I said, "Behold, I have come.  It is written about me
        in the book in the scroll.
040:008 I delight to do your will, my God.  Yes, your law is
        within my heart."
040:009 I have proclaimed glad news of righteousness in the great assembly.
        Behold, I will not seal my lips, Yahweh, you know.
040:010 I have not hidden your righteousness within my heart.
        I have declared your faithfulness and your salvation.
        I have not concealed your loving kindness and your truth
        from the great assembly.
040:011 Don't withhold your tender mercies from me, Yahweh.  Let your
        loving kindness and your truth continually preserve me.
040:012 For innumerable evils have surrounded me.  My iniquities
        have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up.
        They are more than the hairs of my head.  My heart has failed me.
040:013 Be pleased, Yahweh, to deliver me.  Hurry to help me, Yahweh.
040:014 Let them be disappointed and confounded together who seek
        after my soul to destroy it.  Let them be turned backward
        and brought to dishonor who delight in my hurt.
040:015 Let them be desolate by reason of their shame that tell
        me, "Aha!  Aha!"
040:016 Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you.
        Let such as love your salvation say continually,
        "Let Yahweh be exalted!"
040:017 But I am poor and needy.  May the Lord think about me.
        You are my help and my deliverer.  Don't delay, my God.
041:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by David.>> Blessed
        is he who considers the poor.  Yahweh will deliver him
        in the day of evil.
041:002 Yahweh will preserve him, and keep him alive.
        He shall be blessed on the earth, and he will not surrender
        him to the will of his enemies.
041:003 Yahweh will sustain him on his sickbed, and restore him from
        his bed of illness.
041:004 I said, "Yahweh, have mercy on me!  Heal me, for I have
        sinned against you."
041:005 My enemies speak evil against me:  "When will he die,
        and his name perish?"
041:006 If he comes to see me, he speaks falsehood.  His heart gathers
        iniquity to itself.  When he goes abroad, he tells it.
041:007 All who hate me whisper together against me.  They imagine
        the worst for me.
041:008 "An evil disease," they say, "has afflicted him.
        Now that he lies he shall rise up no more."
041:009 Yes, my own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, who ate bread
        with me, has lifted up his heel against me.
041:010 But you, Yahweh, have mercy on me, and raise me up, that I
        may repay them.
041:011 By this I know that you delight in me, because my enemy doesn't
        triumph over me.
041:012 As for me, you uphold me in my integrity, and set me in
        your presence forever.
041:013 Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, from everlasting and
        to everlasting!  Amen and amen.
042:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A contemplation by the sons of
        Korah.>> As the deer pants for the water brooks, so my soul
        pants after you, God.
042:002 My soul thirsts for God, for the living God.  When shall I
        come and appear before God?
042:003 My tears have been my food day and night, while they continually
        ask me, "Where is your God?"
042:004 These things I remember, and pour out my soul within me,
        how I used to go with the crowd, and led them to the house
        of God, with the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping
        a holy day.
042:005 Why are you in despair, my soul?  Why are you disturbed within me?
        Hope in God!  For I shall still praise him for the saving
        help of his presence.
042:006 My God, my soul is in despair within me.  Therefore I remember
        you from the land of the Jordan, the heights of Hermon,
        from the hill Mizar.
042:007 Deep calls to deep at the noise of your waterfalls.
        All your waves and your billows have swept over me.
042:008 Yahweh will command his loving kindness in the daytime.
        In the night his song shall be with me:  a prayer to the God
        of my life.
042:009 I will ask God, my rock, "Why have you forgotten me?
        Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?"
042:010 As with a sword in my bones, my adversaries reproach me,
        while they continually ask me, "Where is your God?"
042:011 Why are you in despair, my soul?  Why are you disturbed within me?
        Hope in God!  For I shall still praise him, the saving help
        of my countenance, and my God.
043:001 Vindicate me, God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation.
        Oh, deliver me from deceitful and wicked men.
043:002 For you are the God of my strength.  Why have you rejected me?
        Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
043:003 Oh, send out your light and your truth.  Let them lead me.
        Let them bring me to your holy hill, To your tents.
043:004 Then I will go to the altar of God, to God, my exceeding joy.
        I will praise you on the harp, God, my God.
043:005 Why are you in despair, my soul?  Why are you disturbed within me?
        Hope in God!  For I shall still praise him:  my Savior,
        my helper, and my God.
044:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  By the sons of Korah.
        A contemplative psalm.>> We have heard with our ears, God;
        our fathers have told us, what work you did in their days,
        in the days of old.
044:002 You drove out the nations with your hand, but you planted them.
        You afflicted the peoples, but you spread them abroad.
044:003 For they didn't get the land in possession by their own sword,
        neither did their own arm save them; but your right hand,
        and your arm, and the light of your face, because you were
        favorable to them.
044:004 You are my King, God.  Command victories for Jacob!
044:005 Through you, will we push down our adversaries.  Through your name,
        will we tread them under who rise up against us.
044:006 For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.
044:007 But you have saved us from our adversaries, and have shamed
        those who hate us.
044:008 In God we have made our boast all day long, we will give thanks
        to your name forever.  Selah.
044:009 But now you rejected us, and brought us to dishonor, and don't
        go out with our armies.
044:010 You make us turn back from the adversary.  Those who hate us
        take spoil for themselves.
044:011 You have made us like sheep for food, and have scattered us
        among the nations.
044:012 You sell your people for nothing, and have gained nothing
        from their sale.
044:013 You make us a reproach to our neighbors, a scoffing and a derision
        to those who are around us.
044:014 You make us a byword among the nations, a shaking of the head
        among the peoples.
044:015 All day long my dishonor is before me, and shame covers my face,
044:016 At the taunt of one who reproaches and verbally abuses,
        because of the enemy and the avenger.
044:017 All this has come on us, yet have we not forgotten you,
        Neither have we been false to your covenant.
044:018 Our heart has not turned back, neither have our steps strayed
        from your path,
044:019 Though you have crushed us in the haunt of jackals, and covered
        us with the shadow of death.
044:020 If we have forgotten the name of our God, or spread forth
        our hands to a strange god;
044:021 won't God search this out?  For he knows the secrets of the heart.
044:022 Yes, for your sake we are killed all day long.  We are regarded
        as sheep for the slaughter.
044:023 Wake up!  Why do you sleep, Lord?  Arise!  Don't reject us forever.
044:024 Why do you hide your face, and forget our affliction
        and our oppression?
044:025 For our soul is bowed down to the dust.  Our body cleaves
        to the earth.
044:026 Rise up to help us.  Redeem us for your loving kindness' sake.
045:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  Set to "The Lilies."  A contemplation
        by the sons of Korah.  A wedding song.>> My heart overflows
        with a noble theme.  I recite my verses for the king.
        My tongue is like the pen of a skillful writer.
045:002 You are the most excellent of the sons of men.  Grace has
        anointed your lips, therefore God has blessed you forever.
045:003 Gird your sword on your thigh, mighty one:  your splendor
        and your majesty.
045:004 In your majesty ride on victoriously on behalf of truth, humility,
        and righteousness.  Let your right hand display awesome deeds.
045:005 Your arrows are sharp.  The nations fall under you, with arrows
        in the heart of the king's enemies.
045:006 Your throne, God, is forever and ever.  A scepter of equity
        is the scepter of your kingdom.
045:007 You have loved righteousness, and hated wickedness.
        Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil
        of gladness above your fellows.
045:008 All your garments smell like myrrh, aloes, and cassia.
        Out of ivory palaces stringed instruments have made you glad.
045:009 Kings' daughters are among your honorable women.
        At your right hand the queen stands in gold of Ophir.
045:010 Listen, daughter, consider, and turn your ear.  Forget your
        own people, and also your father's house.
045:011 So the king will desire your beauty, honor him, for he is your lord.
045:012 The daughter of Tyre comes with a gift.  The rich among
        the people entreat your favor.
045:013 The princess inside is all glorious.  Her clothing is
        interwoven with gold.
045:014 She shall be led to the king in embroidered work.  The virgins,
        her companions who follow her, shall be brought to you.
045:015 With gladness and rejoicing they shall be led.  They shall
        enter into the king's palace.
045:016 Your sons will take the place of your fathers.  You shall make
        them princes in all the earth.
045:017 I will make your name to be remembered in all generations.
        Therefore the peoples shall give you thanks forever and ever.

046:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  By the sons of Korah.
        According to Alamoth.Alamoth is a musical term.>> God is our
        refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
046:002 Therefore we won't be afraid, though the earth changes,
        though the mountains are shaken into the heart of the seas;
046:003 though the waters of it roar and are troubled, though the mountains
        tremble with their swelling.  Selah.
046:004 There is a river, the streams of which make the city of God glad,
        the holy place of the tents of the Most High.
046:005 God is in her midst.  She shall not be moved.  God will help
        her at dawn.
046:006 The nations raged.  The kingdoms were moved.  He lifted his voice,
        and the earth melted.
046:007 Yahweh of Armies is with us.  The God of Jacob is our refuge.  Selah.
046:008 Come, see Yahweh's works, what desolations he has made
        in the earth.
046:009 He makes wars cease to the end of the earth.  He breaks the bow,
        and shatters the spear.  He burns the chariots in the fire.
046:010 "Be still, and know that I am God.  I will be exalted among
        the nations.  I will be exalted in the earth."
046:011 Yahweh of Armies is with us.  The God of Jacob is our refuge.  Selah.
047:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by the sons of Korah.>>
        Oh clap your hands, all you nations.  Shout to God with
        the voice of triumph!
047:002 For Yahweh Most High is awesome.  He is a great King over
        all the earth.
047:003 He subdues nations under us, and peoples under our feet.
047:004 He chooses our inheritance for us, the glory of Jacob whom
        he loved.  Selah.
047:005 God has gone up with a shout, Yahweh with the sound of a trumpet.
047:006 Sing praise to God, sing praises.  Sing praises to our King,
        sing praises.
047:007 For God is the King of all the earth.  Sing praises
        with understanding.
047:008 God reigns over the nations.  God sits on his holy throne.
047:009 The princes of the peoples are gathered together, the people of
        the God of Abraham.  For the shields of the earth belong to God.
        He is greatly exalted!
048:001 <<A Song.  A Psalm by the sons of Korah.>> Great is Yahweh,
        and greatly to be praised, in the city of our God,
        in his holy mountain.
048:002 Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, is Mount Zion,
        on the north sides, the city of the great King.
048:003 God has shown himself in her citadels as a refuge.
048:004 For, behold, the kings assembled themselves, they passed by together.
048:005 They saw it, then they were amazed.  They were dismayed.
        They hurried away.
048:006 Trembling took hold of them there, pain, as of a woman in travail.
048:007 With the east wind, you break the ships of Tarshish.
048:008 As we have heard, so we have seen, in the city of Yahweh of Armies,
        in the city of our God.  God will establish it forever.  Selah.
048:009 We have thought about your loving kindness, God, in the midst
        of your temple.
048:010 As is your name, God, so is your praise to the ends of the earth.
        Your right hand is full of righteousness.
048:011 Let Mount Zion be glad!  Let the daughters of Judah rejoice,
        Because of your judgments.
048:012 Walk about Zion, and go around her.  Number its towers.
048:013 Mark well her bulwarks.  Consider her palaces, that you may
        tell it to the next generation.
048:014 For this God is our God forever and ever.  He will be our guide
        even to death.
049:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by the sons of Korah.>>
        Hear this, all you peoples.  Listen, all you inhabitants
        of the world,
049:002 both low and high, rich and poor together.
049:003 My mouth will speak words of wisdom.  My heart
        shall utter understanding.
049:004 I will incline my ear to a proverb.  I will open my riddle
        on the harp.
049:005 Why should I fear in the days of evil, when iniquity at my
        heels surrounds me?
049:006 Those who trust in their wealth, and boast in the multitude
        of their riches--
049:007 none of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give
        God a ransom for him.
049:008 For the redemption of their life is costly, no payment
        is ever enough,
049:009 That he should live on forever, that he should not see corruption.
049:010 For he sees that wise men die; likewise the fool and the
        senseless perish, and leave their wealth to others.
049:011 Their inward thought is that their houses will endure forever,
        and their dwelling places to all generations.  They name
        their lands after themselves.
049:012 But man, despite his riches, doesn't endure.  He is like
        the animals that perish.
049:013 This is the destiny of those who are foolish, and of those
        who approve their sayings.  Selah.
049:014 They are appointed as a flock for Sheol.  Death shall
        be their shepherd.  The upright shall have dominion over
        them in the morning.  Their beauty shall decay in Sheol,
        far from their mansion.
049:015 But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol,
        for he will receive me.  Selah.
049:016 Don't be afraid when a man is made rich, when the glory of his
        house is increased.
049:017 For when he dies he shall carry nothing away.  His glory shall
        not descend after him.
049:018 Though while he lived he blessed his soul--and men praise you
        when you do well for yourself--
049:019 he shall go to the generation of his fathers.  They shall
        never see the light.
049:020 A man who has riches without understanding, is like the
        animals that perish.
050:001 <<A Psalm by Asaph.>> The Mighty One, God, Yahweh, speaks,
        and calls the earth from sunrise to sunset.
050:002 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shines forth.
050:003 Our God comes, and does not keep silent.  A fire devours before him.
        It is very stormy around him.
050:004 He calls to the heavens above, to the earth, that he may
        judge his people:
050:005 "Gather my saints together to me, those who have made a covenant
        with me by sacrifice."
050:006 The heavens shall declare his righteousness, for God himself
        is judge.  Selah.
050:007 "Hear, my people, and I will speak; Israel, and I will testify
        against you.  I am God, your God.
050:008 I don't rebuke you for your sacrifices.  Your burnt offerings
        are continually before me.
050:009 I have no need for a bull from your stall, nor male goats
        from your pens.
050:010 For every animal of the forest is mine, and the livestock
        on a thousand hills.
050:011 I know all the birds of the mountains.  The wild animals
        of the field are mine.
050:012 If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world is mine,
        and all that is in it.
050:013 Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?
050:014 Offer to God the sacrifice of thanksgiving.  Pay your vows
        to the Most High.
050:015 Call on me in the day of trouble.  I will deliver you,
        and you will honor me."
050:016 But to the wicked God says, "What right do you have to declare
        my statutes, that you have taken my covenant on your lips,
050:017 seeing you hate instruction, and throw my words behind you?
050:018 When you saw a thief, you consented with him, and have
        participated with adulterers.
050:019 "You give your mouth to evil.  Your tongue frames deceit.
050:020 You sit and speak against your brother.  You slander your
        own mother's son.
050:021 You have done these things, and I kept silent.
        You thought that the I was just like you.  I will rebuke you,
        and accuse you in front of your eyes.
050:022 "Now consider this, you who forget God, lest I tear you into pieces,
        and there be none to deliver.
050:023 Whoever offers the sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifies me,
        and prepares his way so that I will show God's salvation to him."
051:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by David, when Nathan
        the prophet came to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba.>>
        Have mercy on me, God, according to your loving kindness.
        According to the multitude of your tender mercies,
        blot out my transgressions.
051:002 Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity.  Cleanse me from my sin.
051:003 For I know my transgressions.  My sin is constantly before me.
051:004 Against you, and you only, have I sinned, and done that which is
        evil in your sight; that you may be proved right when you speak,
        and justified when you judge.
051:005 Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity.  In sin my
        mother conceived me.
051:006 Behold, you desire truth in the inward parts.  You teach me
        wisdom in the inmost place.
051:007 Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean.  Wash me, and I
        will be whiter than snow.
051:008 Let me hear joy and gladness, That the bones which you have
        broken may rejoice.
051:009 Hide your face from my sins, and blot out all of my iniquities.
051:010 Create in me a clean heart, O God.  Renew a right spirit within me.
051:011 Don't throw me from your presence, and don't take your holy
        Spirit from me.
051:012 Restore to me the joy of your salvation.  Uphold me with
        a willing spirit.
051:013 Then I will teach transgressors your ways.  Sinners shall
        be converted to you.
051:014 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, the God of my salvation.
        My tongue shall sing aloud of your righteousness.
051:015 Lord, open my lips.  My mouth shall declare your praise.
051:016 For you don't delight in sacrifice, or else I would give it.
        You have no pleasure in burnt offering.
051:017 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit.  A broken and
        contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.
051:018 Do well in your good pleasure to Zion.  Build the walls of Jerusalem.
051:019 Then you will delight in the sacrifices of righteousness,
        in burnt offerings and in whole burnt offerings.
        Then they will offer bulls on your altar.
052:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A contemplation by David, when Doeg
        the Edomite came and told Saul, "David has come to Abimelech's
        house.">> Why do you boast of mischief, mighty man?
        God's loving kindness endures continually.
052:002 Your tongue plots destruction, like a sharp razor,
        working deceitfully.
052:003 You love evil more than good, lying rather than speaking
        the truth.  Selah.
052:004 You love all devouring words, you deceitful tongue.
052:005 God will likewise destroy you forever.  He will take you up,
        and pluck you out of your tent, and root you out of the land
        of the living.  Selah.
052:006 The righteous also will see it, and fear, and laugh at him, saying,
052:007 "Behold, this is the man who didn't make God his strength,
        but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened
        himself in his wickedness."
052:008 But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in God's house.
        I trust in God's loving kindness forever and ever.
052:009 I will give you thanks forever, because you have done it.
        I will hope in your name, for it is good, in the presence
        of your saints.
053:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  To the tune of "Mahalath." A contemplation
        by David.>> The fool has said in his heart, "There is no God."
        They are corrupt, and have done abominable iniquity.
        There is no one who does good.
053:002 God looks down from heaven on the children of men, to see
        if there are any who understood, who seek after God.
053:003 Every one of them has gone back.  They have become filthy together.
        There is no one who does good, no, not one.
053:004 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge, who eat up my people
        as they eat bread, and don't call on God?
053:005 There they were in great fear, where no fear was, for God
        has scattered the bones of him who encamps against you.
        You have put them to shame, because God has rejected them.
053:006 Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion!  When God
        brings back his people from captivity, then Jacob shall rejoice,
        and Israel shall be glad.
054:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  On stringed instruments.  A contemplation
        by David, when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, "Isn't David
        hiding himself among us?">> Save me, God, by your name.
        Vindicate me in your might.
054:002 Hear my prayer, God.  Listen to the words of my mouth.
054:003 For strangers have risen up against me.  Violent men have sought
        after my soul.  They haven't set God before them.  Selah.
054:004 Behold, God is my helper.  The Lord is the one who sustains my soul.
054:005 He will repay the evil to my enemies.  Destroy them in your truth.
054:006 With a free will offering, I will sacrifice to you.
        I will give thanks to your name, Yahweh, for it is good.
054:007 For he has delivered me out of all trouble.  My eye has seen
        triumph over my enemies.
055:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  On stringed instruments.
        A contemplation by David.>> Listen to my prayer, God.
        Don't hide yourself from my supplication.
055:002 Attend to me, and answer me.  I am restless in my complaint, and moan,
055:003 Because of the voice of the enemy, Because of the oppression
        of the wicked.  For they bring suffering on me.
        In anger they hold a grudge against me.
055:004 My heart is severely pained within me.  The terrors of death
        have fallen on me.
055:005 Fearfulness and trembling have come on me.
        Horror has overwhelmed me.
055:006 I said, "Oh that I had wings like a dove!  Then I would fly away,
        and be at rest.
055:007 Behold, then I would wander far off.  I would lodge in
        the wilderness."  Selah.
055:008 "I would hurry to a shelter from the stormy wind and storm."
055:009 Confuse them, Lord, and confound their language, for I have
        seen violence and strife in the city.
055:010 Day and night they prowl around on its walls.  Malice and abuse
        are also within her.
055:011 Destructive forces are within her.  Threats and lies don't
        depart from her streets.
055:012 For it was not an enemy who insulted me, then I could have
        endured it.  Neither was it he who hated me who raised himself
        up against me, then I would have hid myself from him.
055:013 But it was you, a man like me, my companion, and my familiar friend.
055:014 We took sweet fellowship together.  We walked in God's
        house with company.
055:015 Let death come suddenly on them.  Let them go down alive into Sheol.
        For wickedness is in their dwelling, in the midst of them.
055:016 As for me, I will call on God.  Yahweh will save me.
055:017 Evening, morning, and at noon, I will cry out in distress.
        He will hear my voice.
055:018 He has redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was
        against me, although there are many who oppose me.
055:019 God, who is enthroned forever, will hear, and answer them.
        Selah.  They never change, who don't fear God.
055:020 He raises his hands against his friends.  He has
        violated his covenant.
055:021 His mouth was smooth as butter, but his heart was war.
        His words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords.
055:022 Cast your burden on Yahweh, and he will sustain you.
        He will never allow the righteous to be moved.
055:023 But you, God, will bring them down into the pit of destruction.
        Bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days,
        but I will trust in you.
056:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  To the tune of "Silent Dove in
        Distant Lands."  A poem by David, when the Philistines seized him
        in Gath.>> Be merciful to me, God, for man wants to swallow me up.
        All day long, he attacks and oppresses me.
056:002 My enemies want to swallow me up all day long, for they are
        many who fight proudly against me.
056:003 When I am afraid, I will put my trust in you.
056:004 In God, I praise his word.  In God, I put my trust.
        I will not be afraid.  What can flesh do to me?
056:005 All day long they twist my words.  All their thoughts are
        against me for evil.
056:006 They conspire and lurk, watching my steps, they are eager
        to take my life.
056:007 Shall they escape by iniquity?  In anger cast down the peoples, God.
056:008 You number my wanderings.  You put my tears into your bottle.
        Aren't they in your book?
056:009 Then my enemies shall turn back in the day that I call.
        I know this, that God is for me.
056:010 In God, I will praise his word.  In Yahweh, I will praise his word.
056:011 I have put my trust in God.  I will not be afraid.
        What can man do to me?
056:012 Your vows are on me, God.  I will give thank offerings to you.
056:013 For you have delivered my soul from death, and prevented my
        feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light
        of the living.
057:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  To the tune of "Do Not Destroy."
        A poem by David, when he fled from Saul, in the cave.>> Be
        merciful to me, God, be merciful to me, for my soul takes refuge
        in you.  Yes, in the shadow of your wings, I will take refuge,
        until disaster has passed.
057:002 I cry out to God Most High, to God who accomplishes my
        requests for me.
057:003 He will send from heaven, and save me, he rebukes the one
        who is pursuing me.  Selah.  God will send out his loving
        kindness and his truth.
057:004 My soul is among lions.  I lie among those who are set on fire,
        even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows,
        and their tongue a sharp sword.
057:005 Be exalted, God, above the heavens!  Let your glory be above
        all the earth!
057:006 They have prepared a net for my steps.  My soul is bowed down.
        They dig a pit before me.  They fall into the midst of
        it themselves.  Selah.
057:007 My heart is steadfast, God, my heart is steadfast.
        I will sing, yes, I will sing praises.
057:008 Wake up, my glory!  Wake up, psaltery and harp!
        I will wake up the dawn.
057:009 I will give thanks to you, Lord, among the peoples.
        I will sing praises to you among the nations.
057:010 For your great loving kindness reaches to the heavens,
        and your truth to the skies.
057:011 Be exalted, God, above the heavens.  Let your glory be over
        all the earth.
058:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  To the tune of "Do Not Destroy."
        A poem by David.>> Do you indeed speak righteousness, silent ones?
        Do you judge blamelessly, you sons of men?
058:002 No, in your heart you plot injustice.  You measure out the violence
        of your hands in the earth.
058:003 The wicked go astray from the womb.  They are wayward as soon
        as they are born, speaking lies.
058:004 Their poison is like the poison of a snake; like a deaf cobra
        that stops its ear,
058:005 which doesn't listen to the voice of charmers, no matter
        how skillful the charmer may be.
058:006 Break their teeth, God, in their mouth.  Break out the great
        teeth of the young lions, Yahweh.
058:007 Let them vanish as water that flows away.  When they draw the bow,
        let their arrows be made blunt.
058:008 Let them be like a snail which melts and passes away,
        like the stillborn child, who has not seen the sun.
058:009 Before your pots can feel the heat of the thorns, he will sweep
        away the green and the burning alike.
058:010 The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance.
        He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked;
058:011 so that men shall say, "Most certainly there is a reward
        for the righteous.  Most certainly there is a God who
        judges the earth."
059:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  To the tune of "Do Not Destroy."
        A poem by David, when Saul sent, and they watched the house
        to kill him.>> Deliver me from my enemies, my God.
        Set me on high from those who rise up against me.
059:002 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity.  Save me from
        the bloodthirsty men.
059:003 For, behold, they lie in wait for my soul.  The mighty gather
        themselves together against me, not for my disobedience,
        nor for my sin, Yahweh.
059:004 I have done no wrong, yet they are ready to attack me.
        Rise up, behold, and help me!
059:005 You, Yahweh God of Armies, the God of Israel, rouse yourself to punish
        the nations.  Show no mercy to the wicked traitors.  Selah.
059:006 They return at evening, howling like dogs, and prowl
        around the city.
059:007 Behold, they spew with their mouth.  Swords are in their lips, "For,"
        they say, "who hears us?"
059:008 But you, Yahweh, laugh at them.  You scoff at all the nations.
059:009 Oh, my Strength, I watch for you, for God is my high tower.
059:010 My God will go before me with his loving kindness.
        God will let me look at my enemies in triumph.
059:011 Don't kill them, or my people may forget.  Scatter them
        by your power, and bring them down, Lord our shield.
059:012 For the sin of their mouth, and the words of their lips,
        let them be caught in their pride, for the curses and lies
        which they utter.
059:013 Consume them in wrath.  Consume them, and they will be no more.
        Let them know that God rules in Jacob, to the ends of
        the earth.  Selah.
059:014 At evening let them return.  Let them howl like a dog,
        and go around the city.
059:015 They shall wander up and down for food, and wait all night
        if they aren't satisfied.
059:016 But I will sing of your strength.  Yes, I will sing aloud
        of your loving kindness in the morning.  For you have been
        my high tower, a refuge in the day of my distress.
059:017 To you, my strength, I will sing praises.  For God is my high tower,
        the God of my mercy.
060:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  To the tune of "The Lily of the Covenant."
        A teaching poem by David, when he fought with Aram Naharaim
        and with Aram Zobah, and Joab returned, and killed twelve
        thousand of Edom in the Valley of Salt.>> God, you have
        rejected us.  You have broken us down.  You have been angry.
        Restore us, again.
060:002 You have made the land tremble.  You have torn it.
        Mend its fractures, for it quakes.
060:003 You have shown your people hard things.  You have made us
        drink the wine that makes us stagger.
060:004 You have given a banner to those who fear you, that it may be
        displayed because of the truth.  Selah.
060:005 So that your beloved may be delivered, save with your right hand,
        and answer us.
060:006 God has spoken from his sanctuary:  "I will triumph.
        I will divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of Succoth.
060:007 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine.  Ephraim also is the defense
        of my head.  Judah is my scepter.
060:008 Moab is my wash basin.  I will throw my shoe on Edom.
        I shout in triumph over Philistia."
060:009 Who will bring me into the strong city?  Who has led me to Edom?
060:010 Haven't you, God, rejected us?  You don't go out with
        our armies, God.
060:011 Give us help against the adversary, for the help of man is vain.
060:012 Through God we shall do valiantly, for it is he who will tread
        down our adversaries.
061:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  For a stringed instrument.
        By David.>> Hear my cry, God.  Listen to my prayer.
061:002 From the end of the earth, I will call to you, when my heart
        is overwhelmed.  Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
061:003 For you have been a refuge for me, a strong tower from the enemy.
061:004 I will dwell in your tent forever.  I will take refuge
        in the shelter of your wings.  Selah.
061:005 For you, God, have heard my vows.  You have given me the heritage
        of those who fear your name.
061:006 You will prolong the king's life; his years shall be for generations.
061:007 He shall be enthroned in God's presence forever.  Appoint your
        loving kindness and truth, that they may preserve him.
061:008 So I will sing praise to your name forever, that I may fulfill
        my vows daily.
062:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  To Jeduthan.  A Psalm by David.>>
        My soul rests in God alone.  My salvation is from him.
062:002 He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress--I will
        never be greatly shaken.
062:003 How long will you assault a man, would all of you throw him down,
        Like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence?
062:004 They fully intend to throw him down from his lofty place.
        They delight in lies.  They bless with their mouth, but they
        curse inwardly.  Selah.
062:005 My soul, wait in silence for God alone, for my expectation
        is from him.
062:006 He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress.
        I will not be shaken.
062:007 With God is my salvation and my honor.  The rock of my strength,
        and my refuge, is in God.
062:008 Trust in him at all times, you people.  Pour out your heart
        before him.  God is a refuge for us.  Selah.
062:009 Surely men of low degree are just a breath, and men of high
        degree are a lie.  In the balances they will go up.
        They are together lighter than a breath.
062:010 Don't trust in oppression.  Don't become vain in robbery.
        If riches increase, don't set your heart on them.
062:011 God has spoken once; twice I have heard this, that power
        belongs to God.
062:012 Also to you, Lord, belongs loving kindness, for you reward
        every man according to his work.
063:001 <<A Psalm by David, when he was in the desert of Judah.>> God,
        you are my God.  I will earnestly seek you.  My soul thirsts
        for you.  My flesh longs for you, in a dry and weary land,
        where there is no water.
063:002 So I have seen you in the sanctuary, watching your power
        and your glory.
063:003 Because your loving kindness is better than life, my lips
        shall praise you.
063:004 So I will bless you while I live.  I will lift up my hands
        in your name.
063:005 My soul shall be satisfied as with the richest food.
        My mouth shall praise you with joyful lips,
063:006 when I remember you on my bed, and think about you in
        the night watches.
063:007 For you have been my help.  I will rejoice in the shadow
        of your wings.
063:008 My soul stays close to you.  Your right hand holds me up.
063:009 But those who seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into
        the lower parts of the earth.
063:010 They shall be given over to the power of the sword.
        They shall be jackal food.
063:011 But the king shall rejoice in God.  Everyone who swears by him
        will praise him, for the mouth of those who speak lies
        shall be silenced.
064:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by David.>> Hear my voice,
        God, in my complaint.  Preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
064:002 Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked, from the noisy
        crowd of the ones doing evil;
064:003 who sharpen their tongue like a sword, and aim their arrows,
        deadly words,
064:004 to shoot innocent men from ambushes.  They shoot at him
        suddenly and fearlessly.
064:005 They encourage themselves in evil plans.  They talk about laying
        snares secretly.  They say, "Who will see them?"
064:006 They plot injustice, saying, "We have made a perfect plan!"
        Surely man's mind and heart are cunning.
064:007 But God will shoot at them.  They will be suddenly struck
        down with an arrow.
064:008 Their own tongues shall ruin them.  All who see them will
        shake their heads.
064:009 All mankind shall be afraid.  They shall declare the work of God,
        and shall wisely ponder what he has done.
064:010 The righteous shall be glad in Yahweh, and shall take refuge in him.
        All the upright in heart shall praise him!
065:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by David.  A song.>> Praise
        waits for you, God, in Zion.  To you shall vows be performed.
065:002 You who hear prayer, to you all men will come.
065:003 Sins overwhelmed me, but you atoned for our transgressions.
065:004 Blessed is one whom you choose, and cause to come near,
        that he may live in your courts.  We will be filled with
        the goodness of your house, your holy temple.
065:005 By awesome deeds of righteousness, you answer us, God of
        our salvation.  You who are the hope of all the ends of the earth,
        of those who are far away on the sea;
065:006 Who by his power forms the mountains, having armed
        yourself with strength;
065:007 who stills the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves,
        and the turmoil of the nations.
065:008 They also who dwell in far-away places are afraid at your wonders.
        You call the morning's dawn and the evening with songs of joy.
065:009 You visit the earth, and water it.  You greatly enrich it.
        The river of God is full of water.  You provide them grain,
        for so you have ordained it.
065:010 You drench its furrows.  You level its ridges.  You soften it
        with showers.  You bless it with a crop.
065:011 You crown the year with your bounty.  Your carts
        overflow with abundance.
065:012 The wilderness grasslands overflow.  The hills are
        clothed with gladness.
065:013 The pastures are covered with flocks.  The valleys also are
        clothed with grain.  They shout for joy!  They also sing.
066:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A song.  A Psalm.>> Make a joyful
        shout to God, all the earth!
066:002 Sing to the glory of his name!  Offer glory and praise!
066:003 Tell God, "How awesome are your deeds!  Through the greatness
        of your power, your enemies submit themselves to you.
066:004 All the earth will worship you, and will sing to you;
        they will sing to your name."  Selah.
066:005 Come, and see God's deeds--awesome work on behalf of the
        children of men.
066:006 He turned the sea into dry land.  They went through the river
        on foot.  There, we rejoiced in him.
066:007 He rules by his might forever.  His eyes watch the nations.
        Don't let the rebellious rise up against him.  Selah.
066:008 Praise our God, you peoples!  Make the sound of his praise heard,
066:009 who preserves our life among the living, and doesn't allow
        our feet to be moved.
066:010 For you, God, have tested us.  You have refined us,
        as silver is refined.
066:011 You brought us into prison.  You laid a burden on our backs.
066:012 You allowed men to ride over our heads.  We went through fire
        and through water, but you brought us to the place of abundance.
066:013 I will come into your temple with burnt offerings.
        I will pay my vows to you,
066:014 which my lips promised, and my mouth spoke, when I was in distress.
066:015 I will offer to you burnt offerings of fat animals, with the
        offering of rams, I will offer bulls with goats.  Selah.
066:016 Come, and hear, all you who fear God.  I will declare what he has
        done for my soul.
066:017 I cried to him with my mouth.  He was extolled with my tongue.
066:018 If I cherished sin in my heart, the Lord wouldn't have listened.
066:019 But most certainly, God has listened.  He has heard the voice
        of my prayer.
066:020 Blessed be God, who has not turned away my prayer, nor his
        loving kindness from me.
067:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  With stringed instruments.
        A Psalm.  A song.>> May God be merciful to us, bless us,
        and cause his face to shine on us.  Selah.
067:002 That your way may be known on earth, and your salvation
        among all nations,
067:003 let the peoples praise you, God.  Let all the peoples praise you.
067:004 Oh let the nations be glad and sing for joy, for you will judge
        the peoples with equity, and govern the nations on earth.  Selah.
067:005 Let the peoples praise you, God.  Let all the peoples praise you.
067:006 The earth has yielded its increase.  God, even our own God,
        will bless us.
067:007 God will bless us.  All the ends of the earth shall fear him.
068:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by David.
        A song.>> Let God arise!  Let his enemies be scattered!
        Let them who hate him also flee before him.
068:002 As smoke is driven away, so drive them away.  As wax melts before
        the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.
068:003 But let the righteous be glad.  Let them rejoice before God.
        Yes, let them rejoice with gladness.
068:004 Sing to God!  Sing praises to his name!  Extol him who rides
        on the clouds:  to Yah, his name!  Rejoice before him!
068:005 A father of the fatherless, and a defender of the widows,
        is God in his holy habitation.
068:006 God sets the lonely in families.  He brings out the prisoners
        with singing, but the rebellious dwell in a sun-scorched land.
068:007 God, when you went forth before your people, when you marched
        through the wilderness... Selah.
068:008 The earth trembled.  The sky also poured down rain at
        the presence of the God of Sinai--at the presence of God,
        the God of Israel.
068:009 You, God, sent a plentiful rain.  You confirmed your inheritance,
        when it was weary.
068:010 Your congregation lived therein.  You, God, prepared your
        goodness for the poor.
068:011 The Lord announced the word.  The ones who proclaim it are
        a great company.
068:012 "Kings of armies flee!  They flee!"  She who waits at home
        divides the spoil,
068:013 while you sleep among the campfires, the wings of a dove
        sheathed with silver, her feathers with shining gold.
068:014 When the Almighty scattered kings in her, it snowed on Zalmon.
068:015 The mountains of Bashan are majestic mountains.
        The mountains of Bashan are rugged.
068:016 Why do you look in envy, you rugged mountains, at the mountain
        where God chooses to reign?  Yes, Yahweh will dwell there forever.
068:017 The chariots of God are tens of thousands and thousands of thousands.
        The Lord is among them, from Sinai, into the sanctuary.
068:018 You have ascended on high.  You have led away captives.
        You have received gifts among men, yes, among the rebellious also,
        that Yah God might dwell there.
068:019 Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears our burdens, even the God
        who is our salvation.  Selah.
068:020 God is to us a God of deliverance.  To Yahweh, the Lord,
        belongs escape from death.
068:021 But God will strike through the head of his enemies, the hairy
        scalp of such a one as still continues in his guiltiness.
068:022 The Lord said, "I will bring you again from Bashan, I will bring
        you again from the depths of the sea;
068:023 That you may crush them, dipping your foot in blood,
        that the tongues of your dogs may have their portion
        from your enemies."
068:024 They have seen your processions, God, even the processions
        of my God, my King, into the sanctuary.
068:025 The singers went before, the minstrels followed after,
        in the midst of the ladies playing with tambourines,
068:026 "Bless God in the congregations, even the Lord in the
        assembly of Israel!"
068:027 There is little Benjamin, their ruler, the princes of Judah,
        their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali.
068:028 Your God has commanded your strength.  Strengthen, God, that which
        you have done for us.
068:029 Because of your temple at Jerusalem, kings shall bring
        presents to you.
068:030 Rebuke the wild animal of the reeds, the multitude of the bulls,
        with the calves of the peoples.  Being humbled, may it bring
        bars of silver.  Scatter the nations that delight in war.
068:031 Princes shall come out of Egypt.  Ethiopia shall hurry to stretch
        out her hands to God.
068:032 Sing to God, you kingdoms of the earth!  Sing praises to
        the Lord!  Selah.
068:033 To him who rides on the heaven of heavens, which are of old;
        behold, he utters his voice, a mighty voice.
068:034 Ascribe strength to God!  His excellency is over Israel,
        his strength is in the skies.
068:035 You are awesome, God, in your sanctuaries.
        The God of Israel gives strength and power to his people.
        Praise be to God!
069:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  To the tune of "Lilies." By David.>>
        Save me, God, for the waters have come up to my neck!
069:002 I sink in deep mire, where there is no foothold.
        I have come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.
069:003 I am weary with my crying.  My throat is dry.  My eyes fail,
        looking for my God.
069:004 Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head.
        Those who want to cut me off, being my enemies wrongfully,
        are mighty.  I have to restore what I didn't take away.
069:005 God, you know my foolishness.  My sins aren't hidden from you.
069:006 Don't let those who wait for you be shamed through me,
        Lord Yahweh of Armies.  Don't let those who seek you be brought
        to dishonor through me, God of Israel.
069:007 Because for your sake, I have borne reproach.  Shame has
        covered my face.
069:008 I have become a stranger to my brothers, an alien to
        my mother's children.
069:009 For the zeal of your house consumes me.  The reproaches
        of those who reproach you have fallen on me.
069:010 When I wept and I fasted, that was to my reproach.
069:011 When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a byword to them.
069:012 Those who sit in the gate talk about me.  I am the song
        of the drunkards.
069:013 But as for me, my prayer is to you, Yahweh, in an acceptable time.
        God, in the abundance of your loving kindness, answer me
        in the truth of your salvation.
069:014 Deliver me out of the mire, and don't let me sink.
        Let me be delivered from those who hate me, and out of
        the deep waters.
069:015 Don't let the flood waters overwhelm me, neither let the deep
        swallow me up.  Don't let the pit shut its mouth on me.
069:016 Answer me, Yahweh, for your loving kindness is good.
        According to the multitude of your tender mercies, turn to me.
069:017 Don't hide your face from your servant, for I am in distress.
        Answer me speedily!
069:018 Draw near to my soul, and redeem it.  Ransom me because
        of my enemies.
069:019 You know my reproach, my shame, and my dishonor.
        My adversaries are all before you.
069:020 Reproach has broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness.
        I looked for some to take pity, but there was none;
        for comforters, but I found none.
069:021 They also gave me gall for my food.  In my thirst, they gave
        me vinegar to drink.
069:022 Let their table before them become a snare.  May it become
        a retribution and a trap.
069:023 Let their eyes be darkened, so that they can't see.
        Let their backs be continually bent.
069:024 Pour out your indignation on them.  Let the fierceness of your
        anger overtake them.
069:025 Let their habitation be desolate.  Let no one dwell in their tents.
069:026 For they persecute him whom you have wounded.  They tell
        of the sorrow of those whom you have hurt.
069:027 Charge them with crime upon crime.  Don't let them come
        into your righteousness.
069:028 Let them be blotted out of the book of life, and not be written
        with the righteous.
069:029 But I am in pain and distress.  Let your salvation, God, protect me.
069:030 I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify
        him with thanksgiving.
069:031 It will please Yahweh better than an ox, or a bull that has
        horns and hoofs.
069:032 The humble have seen it, and are glad.  You who seek after God,
        let your heart live.
069:033 For Yahweh hears the needy, and doesn't despise his captive people.
069:034 Let heaven and earth praise him; the seas, and everything
        that moves therein!
069:035 For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah.
        They shall settle there, and own it.
069:036 The children also of his servants shall inherit it.
        Those who love his name shall dwell therein.
070:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  By David.  A reminder.>> Hurry, God,
        to deliver me.  Come quickly to help me, Yahweh.
070:002 Let them be disappointed and confounded who seek my soul.
        Let those who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace.
070:003 Let them be turned because of their shame Who say, "Aha!  Aha!"
070:004 Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you.
        Let those who love your salvation continually say,
        "Let God be exalted!"
070:005 But I am poor and needy.  Come to me quickly, God.  You are
        my help and my deliverer.  Yahweh, don't delay.
071:001 In you, Yahweh, I take refuge.  Never let me be disappointed.
071:002 Deliver me in your righteousness, and rescue me.
        Turn your ear to me, and save me.
071:003 Be to me a rock of refuge to which I may always go.
        Give the command to save me, for you are my rock and my fortress.
071:004 Rescue me, my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the hand
        of the unrighteous and cruel man.
071:005 For you are my hope, Lord Yahweh; my confidence from my youth.
071:006 I have relied on you from the womb.  You are he who took me
        out of my mother's womb.  I will always praise you.
071:007 I am a marvel to many, but you are my strong refuge.
071:008 My mouth shall be filled with your praise, with your honor
        all the day.
071:009 Don't reject me in my old age.  Don't forsake me when
        my strength fails.
071:010 For my enemies talk about me.  Those who watch for my
        soul conspire together,
071:011 saying, "God has forsaken him.  Pursue and take him, for no
        one will rescue him."
071:012 God, don't be far from me.  My God, hurry to help me.
071:013 Let my accusers be disappointed and consumed.  Let them be
        covered with disgrace and scorn who want to harm me.
071:014 But I will always hope, and will add to all of your praise.
071:015 My mouth will tell about your righteousness, and of your
        salvation all day, though I don't know its full measure.
071:016 I will come with the mighty acts of the Lord Yahweh.
        I will make mention of your righteousness, even of yours alone.
071:017 God, you have taught me from my youth.  Until now, I have
        declared your wondrous works.
071:018 Yes, even when I am old and gray-haired, God, don't forsake me,
        until I have declared your strength to the next generation,
        your might to everyone who is to come.
071:019 Your righteousness also, God, reaches to the heavens;
        you have done great things.  God, who is like you?
071:020 You, who have shown us many and bitter troubles, you will
        let me live.  You will bring us up again from the depths
        of the earth.
071:021 Increase my honor, and comfort me again.
071:022 I will also praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, my God.
        I sing praises to you with the lyre, Holy One of Israel.
071:023 My lips shall shout for joy!  My soul, which you have redeemed,
        sings praises to you!
071:024 My tongue will also talk about your righteousness all day long,
        for they are disappointed, and they are confounded, who want
        to harm me.
072:001 <<By Solomon.>> God, give the king your justice; your righteousness
        to the royal son.
072:002 He will judge your people with righteousness, and your
        poor with justice.
072:003 The mountains shall bring prosperity to the people.
        The hills bring the fruit of righteousness.
072:004 He will judge the poor of the people.  He will save the children
        of the needy, and will break the oppressor in pieces.
072:005 They shall fear you while the sun endures; and as long as the moon,
        throughout all generations.
072:006 He will come down like rain on the mown grass, as showers
        that water the earth.
072:007 In his days, the righteous shall flourish, and abundance of peace,
        until the moon is no more.
072:008 He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, from the River
        to the ends of the earth.
072:009 Those who dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him.
        His enemies shall lick the dust.
072:010 The kings of Tarshish and of the islands will bring tribute.
        The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.
072:011 Yes, all kings shall fall down before him.  All nations
        shall serve him.
072:012 For he will deliver the needy when he cries; the poor,
        who has no helper.
072:013 He will have pity on the poor and needy.  He will save the souls
        of the needy.
072:014 He will redeem their soul from oppression and violence.
        Their blood will be precious in his sight.
072:015 They shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba.
        Men shall pray for him continually.  They shall bless him
        all day long.
072:016 There shall be abundance of grain throughout the land.
        Its fruit sways like Lebanon.  Let it flourish, thriving like
        the grass of the field.
072:017 His name endures forever.  His name continues as long as the sun.
        Men shall be blessed by him.  All nations will call him blessed.
072:018 Praise be to Yahweh God, the God of Israel, who alone
        does marvelous deeds.
072:019 Blessed be his glorious name forever!  Let the whole earth
        be filled with his glory!  Amen and amen.
072:020 This ends the prayers by David, the son of Jesse.
073:001 <<A Psalm by Asaph.>> Surely God is good to Israel, to those
        who are pure in heart.
073:002 But as for me, my feet were almost gone.  My steps
        had nearly slipped.
073:003 For I was envious of the arrogant, when I saw the prosperity
        of the wicked.
073:004 For there are no struggles in their death, but their
        strength is firm.
073:005 They are free from burdens of men, neither are they plagued
        like other men.
073:006 Therefore pride is like a chain around their neck.
        Violence covers them like a garment.
073:007 Their eyes bulge with fat.  Their minds pass the limits of conceit.
073:008 They scoff and speak with malice.  In arrogance,
        they threaten oppression.
073:009 They have set their mouth in the heavens.  Their tongue walks
        through the earth.
073:010 Therefore their people return to them, and they drink up
        waters of abundance.
073:011 They say, "How does God know?  Is there knowledge in the Most High?"
073:012 Behold, these are the wicked.  Being always at ease,
        they increase in riches.
073:013 Surely in vain I have cleansed my heart, and washed my
        hands in innocence,
073:014 For all day long have I been plagued, and punished every morning.
073:015 If I had said, "I will speak thus;" behold, I would have betrayed
        the generation of your children.
073:016 When I tried to understand this, it was too painful for me;
073:017 Until I entered God's sanctuary, and considered their latter end.
073:018 Surely you set them in slippery places.  You throw them
        down to destruction.
073:019 How they are suddenly destroyed!  They are completely swept
        away with terrors.
073:020 As a dream when one wakes up, so, Lord, when you awake,
        you will despise their fantasies.
073:021 For my soul was grieved.  I was embittered in my heart.
073:022 I was so senseless and ignorant.  I was a brute beast before you.
073:023 Nevertheless, I am continually with you.  You have held
        my right hand.
073:024 You will guide me with your counsel, and afterward receive
        me to glory.
073:025 Who do I have in heaven?  There is no one on earth who I
        desire besides you.
073:026 My flesh and my heart fails, but God is the strength of my heart
        and my portion forever.
073:027 For, behold, those who are far from you shall perish.
        You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you.
073:028 But it is good for me to come close to God.  I have made
        the Lord Yahweh my refuge, that I may tell of all your works.
074:001 <<A contemplation by Asaph.>> God, why have you rejected us forever?
        Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture?
074:002 Remember your congregation, which you purchased of old,
        which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your inheritance;
        Mount Zion, in which you have lived.
074:003 Lift up your feet to the perpetual ruins, all the evil that
        the enemy has done in the sanctuary.
074:004 Your adversaries have roared in the midst of your assembly.
        They have set up their standards as signs.
074:005 They behaved like men wielding axes, cutting through a
        thicket of trees.
074:006 Now they break all its carved work down with hatchet and hammers.
074:007 They have burned your sanctuary to the ground.
        They have profaned the dwelling place of your Name.
074:008 They said in their heart, "We will crush them completely."
        They have burned up all the places in the land where
        God was worshiped.
074:009 We see no miraculous signs.  There is no longer any prophet,
        neither is there among us anyone who knows how long.
074:010 How long, God, shall the adversary reproach?  Shall the enemy
        blaspheme your name forever?
074:011 Why do you draw back your hand, even your right hand?
        Take it out of your pocket and consume them!
074:012 Yet God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst
        of the earth.
074:013 You divided the sea by your strength.  You broke the heads
        of the sea monsters in the waters.
074:014 You broke the heads of Leviathan in pieces.  You gave him
        as food to people and desert creatures.
074:015 You opened up spring and stream.  You dried up mighty rivers.
074:016 The day is yours, the night is also yours.  You have prepared
        the light and the sun.
074:017 You have set all the boundaries of the earth.  You have made
        summer and winter.
074:018 Remember this, that the enemy has mocked you, Yahweh.
        Foolish people have blasphemed your name.
074:019 Don't deliver the soul of your dove to wild beasts.
        Don't forget the life of your poor forever.
074:020 Honor your covenant, for haunts of violence fill the dark
        places of the earth.
074:021 Don't let the oppressed return ashamed.  Let the poor and needy
        praise your name.
074:022 Arise, God!  Plead your own cause.  Remember how the foolish
        man mocks you all day.
074:023 Don't forget the voice of your adversaries.  The tumult
        of those who rise up against you ascends continually.
075:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  To the tune of "Do Not Destroy."
        A Psalm by Asaph.  A song.>> We give thanks to you, God.
        We give thanks, for your Name is near.  Men tell about
        your wondrous works.
075:002 When I choose the appointed time, I will judge blamelessly.
075:003 The earth and all its inhabitants quake.  I firmly hold
        its pillars.  Selah.
075:004 I said to the arrogant, "Don't boast!"  I said to the wicked,
        "Don't lift up the horn.
075:005 Don't lift up your horn on high.  Don't speak with a stiff neck."
075:006 For neither from the east, nor from the west, nor yet from
        the south, comes exaltation.
075:007 But God is the judge.  He puts down one, and lifts up another.
075:008 For in the hand of Yahweh there is a cup, full of foaming
        wine mixed with spices.  He pours it out.  Indeed the wicked
        of the earth drink and drink it to its very dregs.
075:009 But I will declare this forever:  I will sing praises to
        the God of Jacob.
075:010 I will cut off all the horns of the wicked, but the horns
        of the righteous shall be lifted up.
076:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  On stringed instruments.
        A Psalm by Asaph.  A song.>> In Judah, God is known.
        His name is great in Israel.
076:002 His tent is also in Salem; His dwelling place in Zion.
076:003 There he broke the flaming arrows of the bow, the shield,
        and the sword, and the weapons of war.  Selah.
076:004 Glorious are you, and excellent, more than mountains of game.
076:005 Valiant men lie plundered, they have slept their last sleep.
        None of the men of war can lift their hands.
076:006 At your rebuke, God of Jacob, both chariot and horse are cast
        into a deep sleep.
076:007 You, even you, are to be feared.  Who can stand in your sight
        when you are angry?
076:008 You pronounced judgment from heaven.  The earth feared,
        and was silent,
076:009 when God arose to judgment, to save all the afflicted ones
        of the earth.  Selah.
076:010 Surely the wrath of man praises you.  The survivors of your
        wrath are restrained.
076:011 Make vows to Yahweh your God, and fulfill them!  Let all of his
        neighbors bring presents to him who is to be feared.
076:012 He will cut off the spirit of princes.  He is feared by the kings
        of the earth.
077:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  To Jeduthun.  A Psalm by Asaph.>> My
        cry goes to God!  Indeed, I cry to God for help, and for him
        to listen to me.
077:002 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord.  My hand
        was stretched out in the night, and didn't get tired.
        My soul refused to be comforted.
077:003 I remember God, and I groan.  I complain, and my spirit
        is overwhelmed.  Selah.
077:004 You hold my eyelids open.  I am so troubled that I can't speak.
077:005 I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.
077:006 I remember my song in the night.  I consider in my own heart;
        my spirit diligently inquires:
077:007 "Will the Lord reject us forever?  Will he be favorable no more?
077:008 Has his loving kindness vanished forever?  Does his promise
        fail for generations?
077:009 Has God forgotten to be gracious?  Has he, in anger,
        withheld his compassion?"  Selah.
077:010 Then I thought, "I will appeal to this:  the years of the right
        hand of the Most High."
077:011 I will remember Yah's deeds; for I will remember your
        wonders of old.
077:012 I will also meditate on all your work, and consider your doings.
077:013 Your way, God, is in the sanctuary.  What god is great like God?
077:014 You are the God who does wonders.  You have made your strength
        known among the peoples.
077:015 You have redeemed your people with your arm, the sons of Jacob
        and Joseph.  Selah.
077:016 The waters saw you, God.  The waters saw you, and they writhed.
        The depths also convulsed.
077:017 The clouds poured out water.  The skies resounded with thunder.
        Your arrows also flashed around.
077:018 The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind.  The lightnings
        lit up the world.  The earth trembled and shook.
077:019 Your way was through the sea; your paths through the great waters.
        Your footsteps were not known.
077:020 You led your people like a flock, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
078:001 <<A contemplation by Asaph.>> Hear my teaching, my people.
        Turn your ears to the words of my mouth.
078:002 I will open my mouth in a parable.  I will utter dark
        sayings of old,
078:003 Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
078:004 We will not hide them from their children, telling to
        the generation to come the praises of Yahweh, his strength,
        and his wondrous works that he has done.
078:005 For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed
        a teaching in Israel, which he commanded our fathers,
        that they should make them known to their children;
078:006 that the generation to come might know, even the children
        who should be born; who should arise and tell their children,
078:007 that they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works
        of God, but keep his commandments,
078:008 and might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious
        generation, a generation that didn't make their hearts loyal,
        whose spirit was not steadfast with God.
078:009 The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows,
        turned back in the day of battle.
078:010 They didn't keep God's covenant, and refused to walk in his law.
078:011 They forgot his doings, his wondrous works that he had shown them.
078:012 He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers,
        in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
078:013 He split the sea, and caused them to pass through.
        He made the waters stand as a heap.
078:014 In the daytime he also led them with a cloud, and all night
        with a light of fire.
078:015 He split rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink abundantly
        as out of the depths.
078:016 He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters
        to run down like rivers.
078:017 Yet they still went on to sin against him, to rebel against
        the Most High in the desert.
078:018 They tempted God in their heart by asking food according
        to their desire.
078:019 Yes, they spoke against God.  They said, "Can God prepare
        a table in the wilderness?
078:020 Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out,
        and streams overflowed.  Can he give bread also?
        Will he provide flesh for his people?"
078:021 Therefore Yahweh heard, and was angry.  A fire was kindled
        against Jacob, anger also went up against Israel,
078:022 because they didn't believe in God, and didn't trust
        in his salvation.
078:023 Yet he commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven.
078:024 He rained down manna on them to eat, and gave them food
        from the sky.
078:025 Man ate the bread of angels.  He sent them food to the full.
078:026 He caused the east wind to blow in the sky.  By his power
        he guided the south wind.
078:027 He rained also flesh on them as the dust; winged birds
        as the sand of the seas.
078:028 He let them fall in the midst of their camp,
        around their habitations.
078:029 So they ate, and were well filled.  He gave them their own desire.
078:030 They didn't turn from their cravings.  Their food was yet
        in their mouths,
078:031 when the anger of God went up against them, killed some of
        the fattest of them, and struck down the young men of Israel.
078:032 For all this they still sinned, and didn't believe in
        his wondrous works.
078:033 Therefore he consumed their days in vanity, and their
        years in terror.
078:034 When he killed them, then they inquired after him.
        They returned and sought God earnestly.
078:035 They remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God,
        their redeemer.
078:036 But they flattered him with their mouth, and lied to him
        with their tongue.
078:037 For their heart was not right with him, neither were they
        faithful in his covenant.
078:038 But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn't destroy them.
        Yes, many times he turned his anger away, and didn't stir up
        all his wrath.
078:039 He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes away,
        and doesn't come again.
078:040 How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness,
        and grieved him in the desert!
078:041 They turned again and tempted God, and provoked the
        Holy One of Israel.
078:042 They didn't remember his hand, nor the day when he redeemed
        them from the adversary;
078:043 how he set his signs in Egypt, his wonders in the field of Zoan,
078:044 he turned their rivers into blood, and their streams,
        so that they could not drink.
078:045 He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them;
        and frogs, which destroyed them.
078:046 He gave also their increase to the caterpillar, and their labor
        to the locust.
078:047 He destroyed their vines with hail, their sycamore fig
        trees with frost.
078:048 He gave over their livestock also to the hail, and their flocks
        to hot thunderbolts.
078:049 He threw on them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, indignation,
        and trouble, and a band of angels of evil.
078:050 He made a path for his anger.  He didn't spare their soul
        from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence,
078:051 and struck all the firstborn in Egypt, the chief of their
        strength in the tents of Ham.
078:052 But he led forth his own people like sheep, and guided them
        in the wilderness like a flock.
078:053 He led them safely, so that they weren't afraid, but the sea
        overwhelmed their enemies.
078:054 He brought them to the border of his sanctuary, to this mountain,
        which his right hand had taken.
078:055 He also drove out the nations before them, allotted them
        for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel
        to dwell in their tents.
078:056 Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God,
        and didn't keep his testimonies;
078:057 but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers.
        They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
078:058 For they provoked him to anger with their high places,
        and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.
078:059 When God heard this, he was angry, and greatly abhorred Israel;
078:060 So that he forsook the tent of Shiloh, the tent which he
        placed among men;
078:061 and delivered his strength into captivity, his glory into
        the adversary's hand.
078:062 He also gave his people over to the sword, and was angry
        with his inheritance.
078:063 Fire devoured their young men.  Their virgins had no wedding song.
078:064 Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows couldn't weep.
078:065 Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep, like a mighty man
        who shouts by reason of wine.
078:066 He struck his adversaries backward.  He put them to
        a perpetual reproach.
078:067 Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph, and didn't choose
        the tribe of Ephraim,
078:068 But chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion which he loved.
078:069 He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth
        which he has established forever.
078:070 He also chose David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds;
078:071 from following the ewes that have their young, he brought him to be
        the shepherd of Jacob, his people, and Israel, his inheritance.
078:072 So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart,
        and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.
079:001 <<A Psalm by Asaph.>> God, the nations have come into
        your inheritance.  They have defiled your holy temple.
        They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.
079:002 They have given the dead bodies of your servants to be food
        for the birds of the sky, the flesh of your saints to the animals
        of the earth.
079:003 Their blood they have shed like water around Jerusalem.
        There was no one to bury them.
079:004 We have become a reproach to our neighbors, a scoffing and
        derision to those who are around us.
079:005 How long, Yahweh?  Will you be angry forever?  Will your jealousy
        burn like fire?
079:006 Pour out your wrath on the nations that don't know you;
        on the kingdoms that don't call on your name;
079:007 For they have devoured Jacob, and destroyed his homeland.
079:008 Don't hold the iniquities of our forefathers against us.
        Let your tender mercies speedily meet us, for we are
        in desperate need.
079:009 Help us, God of our salvation, for the glory of your name.
        Deliver us, and forgive our sins, for your name's sake.
079:010 Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?"  Let it
        be known among the nations, before our eyes, that vengeance
        for your servants' blood is being poured out.
079:011 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before you.
        According to the greatness of your power, preserve those who
        are sentenced to death.
079:012 Pay back to our neighbors seven times into their bosom their
        reproach with which they have reproached you, Lord.
079:013 So we, your people and sheep of your pasture, will give you
        thanks forever.  We will praise you forever, to all generations.
080:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  To the tune of "The Lilies of
        the Covenant."  A Psalm by Asaph.>> Hear us, Shepherd of Israel,
        you who lead Joseph like a flock, you who sit above
        the cherubim, shine forth.
080:002 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up your might!
        Come to save us!
080:003 Turn us again, God.  Cause your face to shine, and we
        will be saved.
080:004 Yahweh God of Armies, How long will you be angry against
        the prayer of your people?
080:005 You have fed them with the bread of tears, and given them
        tears to drink in large measure.
080:006 You make us a source of contention to our neighbors.
        Our enemies laugh among themselves.
080:007 Turn us again, God of Armies.  Cause your face to shine,
        and we will be saved.
080:008 You brought a vine out of Egypt.  You drove out the nations,
        and planted it.
080:009 You cleared the ground for it.  It took deep root,
        and filled the land.
080:010 The mountains were covered with its shadow.  Its boughs were
        like God's cedars.
080:011 It sent out its branches to the sea, Its shoots to the River.
080:012 Why have you broken down its walls, so that all those who pass
        by the way pluck it?
080:013 The boar out of the wood ravages it.  The wild animals
        of the field feed on it.
080:014 Turn again, we beg you, God of Armies.  Look down from heaven,
        and see, and visit this vine,
080:015 the stock which your right hand planted, the branch that you
        made strong for yourself.
080:016 It's burned with fire.  It's cut down.  They perish at your rebuke.
080:017 Let your hand be on the man of your right hand, on the son
        of man whom you made strong for yourself.
080:018 So we will not turn away from you.  Revive us, and we will call
        on your name.
080:019 Turn us again, Yahweh God of Armies.  Cause your face to shine,
        and we will be saved.
081:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  On an instrument of Gath.
        By Asaph.>> Sing aloud to God, our strength!  Make a joyful
        shout to the God of Jacob!
081:002 Raise a song, and bring here the tambourine, the pleasant lyre
        with the harp.
081:003 Blow the trumpet at the New Moon, at the full moon,
        on our feast day.
081:004 For it is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob.
081:005 He appointed it in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out over
        the land of Egypt, I heard a language that I didn't know.
081:006 "I removed his shoulder from the burden.  His hands were freed
        from the basket.
081:007 You called in trouble, and I delivered you.  I answered you
        in the secret place of thunder.  I tested you at the waters
        of Meribah."  Selah.
081:008 "Hear, my people, and I will testify to you, Israel, if you
        would listen to me!
081:009 There shall be no strange god in you, neither shall you worship
        any foreign god.
081:010 I am Yahweh, your God, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.
        Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.
081:011 But my people didn't listen to my voice.  Israel desired
        none of me.
081:012 So I let them go after the stubbornness of their hearts,
        that they might walk in their own counsels.
081:013 Oh that my people would listen to me, that Israel would walk
        in my ways!
081:014 I would soon subdue their enemies, and turn my hand
        against their adversaries.
081:015 The haters of Yahweh would cringe before him, and their punishment
        would last forever.
081:016 But he would have also fed them with the finest of the wheat.
        I will satisfy you with honey out of the rock."
082:001 <<A Psalm by Asaph.>> God presides in the great assembly.
        He judges among the gods.
082:002 "How long will you judge unjustly, and show partiality
        to the wicked?"  Selah.
082:003 "Defend the weak, the poor, and the fatherless.
        Maintain the rights of the poor and oppressed.
082:004 Rescue the weak and needy.  Deliver them out of the hand
        of the wicked."
082:005 They don't know, neither do they understand.
        They walk back and forth in darkness.  All the foundations
        of the earth are shaken.
082:006 I said, "You are gods, all of you are sons of the Most High.
082:007 Nevertheless you shall die like men, and fall like one
        of the rulers."
082:008 Arise, God, judge the earth, for you inherit all of the nations.
083:001 <<A song.  A Psalm by Asaph.>> God, don't keep silent.
        Don't keep silent, and don't be still, God.
083:002 For, behold, your enemies are stirred up.  Those who hate you
        have lifted up their heads.
083:003 They conspire with cunning against your people.
        They plot against your cherished ones.
083:004 "Come," they say, "and let's destroy them as a nation,
        that the name of Israel may be remembered no more."
083:005 For they have conspired together with one mind.
        They form an alliance against you.
083:006 The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab, and the Hagrites;
083:007 Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;
083:008 Assyria also is joined with them.  They have helped the children
        of Lot.  Selah.
083:009 Do to them as you did to Midian, as to Sisera, as to Jabin,
        at the river Kishon;
083:010 who perished at Endor, who became as dung for the earth.
083:011 Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb; yes, all their princes
        like Zebah and Zalmunna;
083:012 who said, "Let us take possession of God's pasturelands."
083:013 My God, make them like tumbleweed; like chaff before the wind.
083:014 As the fire that burns the forest, as the flame that sets
        the mountains on fire,
083:015 so pursue them with your tempest, and terrify them with your storm.
083:016 Fill their faces with confusion, that they may seek
        your name, Yahweh.
083:017 Let them be disappointed and dismayed forever.  Yes, let them
        be confounded and perish;
083:018 that they may know that you alone, whose name is Yahweh,
        are the Most High over all the earth.
084:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  On an instrument of Gath.
        A Psalm by the sons of Korah.>> How lovely are your dwellings,
        Yahweh of Armies!
084:002 My soul longs, and even faints for the courts of Yahweh.
        My heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.
084:003 Yes, the sparrow has found a home, and the swallow a nest
        for herself, where she may have her young, near your altars,
        Yahweh of Armies, my King, and my God.
084:004 Blessed are those who dwell in your house.  They are always
        praising you.  Selah.
084:005 Blessed are those whose strength is in you; who have set
        their hearts on a pilgrimage.
084:006 Passing through the valley of Weeping, they make it a place
        of springs.  Yes, the autumn rain covers it with blessings.
084:007 They go from strength to strength.  Everyone of them appears
        before God in Zion.
084:008 Yahweh, God of Armies, hear my prayer.  Listen, God of Jacob.  Selah.
084:009 Behold, God our shield, look at the face of your anointed.
084:010 For a day in your courts is better than a thousand.
        I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God,
        than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
084:011 For Yahweh God is a sun and a shield.  Yahweh will give
        grace and glory.  He withholds no good thing from those
        who walk blamelessly.
084:012 Yahweh of Armies, blessed is the man who trusts in you.
085:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by the sons of Korah.>> Yahweh,
        you have been favorable to your land.  You have restored
        the fortunes of Jacob.
085:002 You have forgiven the iniquity of your people.  You have covered
        all their sin.  Selah.
085:003 You have taken away all your wrath.  You have turned from
        the fierceness of your anger.
085:004 Turn us, God of our salvation, and cause your indignation
        toward us to cease.
085:005 Will you be angry with us forever?  Will you draw out your anger
        to all generations?
085:006 Won't you revive us again, that your people may rejoice in you?
085:007 Show us your loving kindness, Yahweh.  Grant us your salvation.
085:008 I will hear what God, Yahweh, will speak, for he will speak
        peace to his people, his saints; but let them not turn
        again to folly.
085:009 Surely his salvation is near those who fear him, that glory
        may dwell in our land.
085:010 Mercy and truth meet together.  Righteousness and peace have
        kissed each other.
085:011 Truth springs out of the earth.  Righteousness has looked
        down from heaven.
085:012 Yes, Yahweh will give that which is good.  Our land will
        yield its increase.
085:013 Righteousness goes before him, And prepares the way for his steps.
086:001 <<A Prayer by David.>> Hear, Yahweh, and answer me, for I am
        poor and needy.
086:002 Preserve my soul, for I am godly.  You, my God, save your
        servant who trusts in you.
086:003 Be merciful to me, Lord, for I call to you all day long.
086:004 Bring joy to the soul of your servant, for to you, Lord, do I
        lift up my soul.
086:005 For you, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive; abundant in loving
        kindness to all those who call on you.
086:006 Hear, Yahweh, my prayer.  Listen to the voice of my petitions.
086:007 In the day of my trouble I will call on you, for you
        will answer me.
086:008 There is no one like you among the gods, Lord, nor any deeds
        like your deeds.
086:009 All nations you have made will come and worship before you, Lord.
        They shall glorify your name.
086:010 For you are great, and do wondrous things.  You are God alone.
086:011 Teach me your way, Yahweh.  I will walk in your truth.
        Make my heart undivided to fear your name.
086:012 I will praise you, Lord my God, with my whole heart.
        I will glorify your name forevermore.
086:013 For your loving kindness is great toward me.  You have delivered
        my soul from the lowest Sheol.
086:014 God, the proud have risen up against me.  A company of violent
        men have sought after my soul, and they don't hold regard
        for you before them.
086:015 But you, Lord, are a merciful and gracious God, slow to anger,
        and abundant in loving kindness and truth.
086:016 Turn to me, and have mercy on me!  Give your strength to
        your servant.  Save the son of your handmaid.
086:017 Show me a sign of your goodness, that those who hate me may
        see it, and be shamed, because you, Yahweh, have helped me,
        and comforted me.
087:001 <<A Psalm by the sons of Korah; a Song.>> His foundation
        is in the holy mountains.
087:002 Yahweh loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
087:003 Glorious things are spoken about you, city of God.  Selah.
087:004 I will record Rahab{Rahab is a reference to Egypt.} and Babylon
        among those who acknowledge me.  Behold, Philistia, Tyre,
        and also Ethiopia:  "This one was born there."
087:005 Yes, of Zion it will be said, "This one and that one was born
        in her;" the Most High himself will establish her.
087:006 Yahweh will count, when he writes up the peoples, "This one
        was born there."  Selah.
087:007 Those who sing as well as those who dance say, "All my springs
        are in you."
088:001 <<A Song.  A Psalm by the sons of Korah.  For the Chief Musician.
        To the tune of "The Suffering of Affliction."  A contemplation
        by Heman, the Ezrahite.>> Yahweh, the God of my salvation,
        I have cried day and night before you.
088:002 Let my prayer enter into your presence.  Turn your ear to my cry.
088:003 For my soul is full of troubles.  My life draws near to Sheol.
088:004 I am counted among those who go down into the pit.
        I am like a man who has no help,
088:005 set apart among the dead, like the slain who lie in the grave,
        whom you remember no more.  They are cut off from your hand.
088:006 You have laid me in the lowest pit, in the darkest depths.
088:007 Your wrath lies heavily on me.  You have afflicted me with all
        your waves.  Selah.
088:008 You have taken my friends from me.  You have made me an abomination
        to them.  I am confined, and I can't escape.
088:009 My eyes are dim from grief.  I have called on you daily, Yahweh.
        I have spread out my hands to you.
088:010 Do you show wonders to the dead?  Do the dead rise up and
        praise you?  Selah.
088:011 Is your loving kindness declared in the grave?
        Or your faithfulness in Destruction?
088:012 Are your wonders made known in the dark?  Or your righteousness
        in the land of forgetfulness?
088:013 But to you, Yahweh, I have cried.  In the morning, my prayer
        comes before you.
088:014 Yahweh, why do you reject my soul?  Why do you hide your
        face from me?
088:015 I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up.
        While I suffer your terrors, I am distracted.
088:016 Your fierce wrath has gone over me.  Your terrors have cut me off.
088:017 They came around me like water all day long.
        They completely engulfed me.
088:018 You have put lover and friend far from me, and my
        friends into darkness.
089:001 <<A contemplation by Ethan, the Ezrahite.>> I will sing
        of the loving kindness of Yahweh forever.  With my mouth,
        I will make known your faithfulness to all generations.
089:002 I indeed declare, "Love stands firm forever.  You established
        the heavens.  Your faithfulness is in them."
089:003 "I have made a covenant with my chosen one, I have sworn
        to David, my servant,
089:004 'I will establish your seed forever, and build up your throne
        to all generations.'"  Selah.
089:005 The heavens will praise your wonders, Yahweh; your faithfulness
        also in the assembly of the holy ones.
089:006 For who in the skies can be compared to Yahweh?  Who among
        the sons of the heavenly beings is like Yahweh,
089:007 a very awesome God in the council of the holy ones, to be feared
        above all those who are around him?
089:008 Yahweh, God of Armies, who is a mighty one, like you?
        Yah, your faithfulness is around you.
089:009 You rule the pride of the sea.  When its waves rise up,
        you calm them.
089:010 You have broken Rahab in pieces, like one of the slain.
        You have scattered your enemies with your mighty arm.
089:011 The heavens are yours.  The earth also is yours; the world
        and its fullness.  You have founded them.
089:012 The north and the south, you have created them.
        Tabor and Hermon rejoice in your name.
089:013 You have a mighty arm.  Your hand is strong, and your right
        hand is exalted.
089:014 Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne.
        Loving kindness and truth go before your face.
089:015 Blessed are the people who learn to acclaim you.
        They walk in the light of your presence, Yahweh.
089:016 In your name they rejoice all day.  In your righteousness,
        they are exalted.
089:017 For you are the glory of their strength.  In your favor,
        our horn will be exalted.
089:018 For our shield belongs to Yahweh; our king to the Holy One of Israel.
089:019 Then you spoke in vision to your saints, and said, "I have
        bestowed strength on the warrior.  I have exalted a young
        man from the people.
089:020 I have found David, my servant.  I have anointed him with
        my holy oil,
089:021 with whom my hand shall be established.  My arm will
        also strengthen him.
089:022 No enemy will tax him.  No wicked man will oppress him.
089:023 I will beat down his adversaries before him, and strike
        those who hate him.
089:024 But my faithfulness and my loving kindness will be with him.
        In my name, his horn will be exalted.
089:025 I will set his hand also on the sea, and his right hand
        on the rivers.
089:026 He will call to me, 'You are my Father, my God, and the rock
        of my salvation!'
089:027 I will also appoint him my firstborn, the highest of the kings
        of the earth.
089:028 I will keep my loving kindness for him forevermore.
        My covenant will stand firm with him.
089:029 I will also make his seed endure forever, and his throne
        as the days of heaven.
089:030 If his children forsake my law, and don't walk in my ordinances;
089:031 if they break my statutes, and don't keep my commandments;
089:032 then I will punish their sin with the rod, and their
        iniquity with stripes.
089:033 But I will not completely take my loving kindness from him,
        nor allow my faithfulness to fail.
089:034 I will not break my covenant, nor alter what my lips have uttered.
089:035 Once have I sworn by my holiness, I will not lie to David.
089:036 His seed will endure forever, his throne like the sun before me.
089:037 It will be established forever like the moon, the faithful
        witness in the sky."  Selah.
089:038 But you have rejected and spurned.  You have been angry
        with your anointed.
089:039 You have renounced the covenant of your servant.
        You have defiled his crown in the dust.
089:040 You have broken down all his hedges.  You have brought his
        strongholds to ruin.
089:041 All who pass by the way rob him.  He has become a reproach
        to his neighbors.
089:042 You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries.
        You have made all of his enemies rejoice.
089:043 Yes, you turn back the edge of his sword, and haven't supported
        him in battle.
089:044 You have ended his splendor, and thrown his throne down
        to the ground.
089:045 You have shortened the days of his youth.  You have covered
        him with shame.  Selah.
089:046 How long, Yahweh?  Will you hide yourself forever?
        Will your wrath burn like fire?
089:047 Remember how short my time is!  For what vanity have you
        created all the children of men!
089:048 What man is he who shall live and not see death, who shall
        deliver his soul from the power of Sheol?  Selah.
089:049 Lord, where are your former loving kindnesses, which you swore
        to David in your faithfulness?
089:050 Remember, Lord, the reproach of your servants, how I bear
        in my heart the taunts of all the mighty peoples,
089:051 With which your enemies have mocked, Yahweh, with which they
        have mocked the footsteps of your anointed one.
089:052 Blessed be Yahweh forevermore.  Amen, and Amen.
090:001 <<A Prayer by Moses, the man of God.>> Lord, you have been
        our dwelling place for all generations.
090:002 Before the mountains were brought forth, before you had formed
        the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting,
        you are God.
090:003 You turn man to destruction, saying, "Return, you children of men."
090:004 For a thousand years in your sight are just like yesterday
        when it is past, like a watch in the night.
090:005 You sweep them away as they sleep.  In the morning they sprout
        like new grass.
090:006 In the morning it sprouts and springs up.  By evening,
        it is withered and dry.
090:007 For we are consumed in your anger.  We are troubled in your wrath.
090:008 You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins
        in the light of your presence.
090:009 For all our days have passed away in your wrath.
        We bring our years to an end as a sigh.
090:010 The days of our years are seventy, or even by reason of strength
        eighty years; yet their pride is but labor and sorrow,
        for it passes quickly, and we fly away.
090:011 Who knows the power of your anger, your wrath according
        to the fear that is due to you?
090:012 So teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.
090:013 Relent, Yahweh!  How long?  Have compassion on your servants!
090:014 Satisfy us in the morning with your loving kindness, that we
        may rejoice and be glad all our days.
090:015 Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us,
        for as many years as we have seen evil.
090:016 Let your work appear to your servants; your glory to their children.
090:017 Let the favor of the Lord our God be on us; establish the work
        of our hands for us; yes, establish the work of our hands.
091:001 He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High will rest
        in the shadow of the Almighty.
091:002 I will say of Yahweh, "He is my refuge and my fortress;
        my God, in whom I trust."
091:003 For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler,
        and from the deadly pestilence.
091:004 He will cover you with his feathers.  Under his wings you will
        take refuge.  His faithfulness is your shield and rampart.
091:005 You shall not be afraid of the terror by night, nor of the arrow
        that flies by day;
091:006 nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness, nor of the destruction
        that wastes at noonday.
091:007 A thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your
        right hand; but it will not come near you.
091:008 You will only look with your eyes, and see the recompense
        of the wicked.
091:009 Because you have made Yahweh your refuge, and the Most High
        your dwelling place,
091:010 no evil shall happen to you, neither shall any plague come
        near your dwelling.
091:011 For he will give his angels charge over you, to guard you
        in all your ways.
091:012 They will bear you up in their hands, so that you won't dash
        your foot against a stone.
091:013 You will tread on the lion and cobra.  You will trample
        the young lion and the serpent underfoot.
091:014 "Because he has set his love on me, therefore I will deliver him.
        I will set him on high, because he has known my name.
091:015 He will call on me, and I will answer him.  I will be with him
        in trouble.  I will deliver him, and honor him.
091:016 I will satisfy him with long life, and show him my salvation."
092:001 <<A Psalm.  A song for the Sabbath day.>> It is a good thing
        to give thanks to Yahweh, to sing praises to your name, Most High;
092:002 to proclaim your loving kindness in the morning, and your
        faithfulness every night,
092:003 with the ten-stringed lute, with the harp, and with the melody
        of the lyre.
092:004 For you, Yahweh, have made me glad through your work.
        I will triumph in the works of your hands.
092:005 How great are your works, Yahweh!  Your thoughts are very deep.
092:006 A senseless man doesn't know, neither does a fool understand this:
092:007 though the wicked spring up as the grass, and all the evil-doers
        flourish, they will be destroyed forever.
092:008 But you, Yahweh, are on high forevermore.
092:009 For, behold, your enemies, Yahweh, for, behold, your enemies
        shall perish.  All the evil-doers will be scattered.
092:010 But you have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox.
        I am anointed with fresh oil.
092:011 My eye has also seen my enemies.  My ears have heard of the wicked
        enemies who rise up against me.
092:012 The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree.
        He will grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
092:013 They are planted in Yahweh's house.  They will flourish
        in our God's courts.
092:014 They will still bring forth fruit in old age.  They will be
        full of sap and green,
092:015 to show that Yahweh is upright.  He is my rock, and there
        is no unrighteousness in him.
093:001 Yahweh reigns!  He is clothed with majesty!  Yahweh is
        armed with strength.  The world also is established.
        It can't be moved.
093:002 Your throne is established from long ago.  You are from everlasting.
093:003 The floods have lifted up, Yahweh, the floods have lifted up
        their voice.  The floods lift up their waves.
093:004 Above the voices of many waters, the mighty breakers of the sea,
        Yahweh on high is mighty.
093:005 Your statutes stand firm.  Holiness adorns your house,
        Yahweh, forevermore.
094:001 Yahweh, you God to whom vengeance belongs, you God to whom
        vengeance belongs, shine forth.
094:002 Rise up, you judge of the earth.  Pay back the proud
        what they deserve.
094:003 Yahweh, how long will the wicked, how long will the wicked triumph?
094:004 They pour out arrogant words.  All the evil-doers boast.
094:005 They break your people in pieces, Yahweh, and afflict your heritage.
094:006 They kill the widow and the alien, and murder the fatherless.
094:007 They say, "Yah will not see, neither will Jacob's God consider."
094:008 Consider, you senseless among the people; you fools,
        when will you be wise?
094:009 He who implanted the ear, won't he hear?  He who formed the eye,
        won't he see?
094:010 He who disciplines the nations, won't he punish?
        He who teaches man knows.
094:011 Yahweh knows the thoughts of man, that they are futile.
094:012 Blessed is the man whom you discipline, Yah, and teach out
        of your law;
094:013 that you may give him rest from the days of adversity,
        until the pit is dug for the wicked.
094:014 For Yahweh won't reject his people, neither will he
        forsake his inheritance.
094:015 For judgment will return to righteousness.  All the upright
        in heart shall follow it.
094:016 Who will rise up for me against the wicked?  Who will stand
        up for me against the evil-doers?
094:017 Unless Yahweh had been my help, my soul would have soon
        lived in silence.
094:018 When I said, "My foot is slipping!"  Your loving kindness,
        Yahweh, held me up.
094:019 In the multitude of my thoughts within me, your comforts
        delight my soul.
094:020 Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with you,
        which brings about mischief by statute?
094:021 They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous,
        and condemn the innocent blood.
094:022 But Yahweh has been my high tower, my God, the rock of my refuge.
094:023 He has brought on them their own iniquity, and will cut them off
        in their own wickedness.  Yahweh, our God, will cut them off.
095:001 Oh come, let's sing to Yahweh.  Let's shout aloud to the rock
        of our salvation!
095:002 Let's come before his presence with thanksgiving.
        Let's extol him with songs!
095:003 For Yahweh is a great God, a great King above all gods.
095:004 In his hand are the deep places of the earth.  The heights
        of the mountains are also his.
095:005 The sea is his, and he made it.  His hands formed the dry land.
095:006 Oh come, let's worship and bow down.  Let's kneel
        before Yahweh, our Maker,
095:007 for he is our God.  We are the people of his pasture, and the sheep
        in his care.  Today, oh that you would hear his voice!
095:008 Don't harden your heart, as at Meribah, as in the day of Massah
        in the wilderness,
095:009 when your fathers tempted me, tested me, and saw my work.
095:010 Forty long years I was grieved with that generation,
        and said, "It is a people that errs in their heart.
        They have not known my ways."
095:011 Therefore I swore in my wrath, "They won't enter into my rest."
096:001 Sing to Yahweh a new song!  Sing to Yahweh, all the earth.
096:002 Sing to Yahweh!  Bless his name!  Proclaim his salvation
        from day to day!
096:003 Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among
        all the peoples.
096:004 For great is Yahweh, and greatly to be praised!
        He is to be feared above all gods.
096:005 For all the gods of the peoples are idols, but Yahweh
        made the heavens.
096:006 Honor and majesty are before him.  Strength and beauty are
        in his sanctuary.
096:007 Ascribe to Yahweh, you families of nations, ascribe to Yahweh
        glory and strength.
096:008 Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name.  Bring an offering,
        and come into his courts.
096:009 Worship Yahweh in holy array.  Tremble before him, all the earth.
096:010 Say among the nations, "Yahweh reigns."  The world is
        also established.  It can't be moved.  He will judge
        the peoples with equity.
096:011 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice.
        Let the sea roar, and its fullness!
096:012 Let the field and all that is in it exult!  Then all the trees
        of the woods shall sing for joy
096:013 before Yahweh; for he comes, for he comes to judge the earth.
        He will judge the world with righteousness, the peoples
        with his truth.
097:001 Yahweh reigns!  Let the earth rejoice!  Let the multitude
        of islands be glad!
097:002 Clouds and darkness are around him.  Righteousness and justice
        are the foundation of his throne.
097:003 A fire goes before him, and burns up his adversaries on every side.
097:004 His lightning lights up the world.  The earth sees, and trembles.
097:005 The mountains melt like wax at the presence of Yahweh,
        at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.
097:006 The heavens declare his righteousness.  All the peoples have
        seen his glory.
097:007 Let all them be shamed who serve engraved images, who boast
        in their idols.  Worship him, all you gods!
097:008 Zion heard and was glad.  The daughters of Judah rejoiced,
        because of your judgments, Yahweh.
097:009 For you, Yahweh, are most high above all the earth.
        You are exalted far above all gods.
097:010 You who love Yahweh, hate evil.  He preserves the souls of
        his saints.  He delivers them out of the hand of the wicked.
097:011 Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the
        upright in heart.
097:012 Be glad in Yahweh, you righteous people!  Give thanks to
        his holy Name.
098:001 <<A Psalm.>> Sing to Yahweh a new song, for he has done
        marvelous things!  His right hand, and his holy arm,
        have worked salvation for him.
098:002 Yahweh has made known his salvation.  He has openly shown
        his righteousness in the sight of the nations.
098:003 He has remembered his loving kindness and his faithfulness
        toward the house of Israel.  All the ends of the earth have
        seen the salvation of our God.
098:004 Make a joyful noise to Yahweh, all the earth!  Burst out and sing
        for joy, yes, sing praises!
098:005 Sing praises to Yahweh with the harp, with the harp and
        the voice of melody.
098:006 With trumpets and sound of the ram's horn, make a joyful noise
        before the King, Yahweh.
098:007 Let the sea roar with its fullness; the world, and those
        who dwell therein.
098:008 Let the rivers clap their hands.  Let the mountains sing
        for joy together.
098:009 Let them sing before Yahweh, for he comes to judge the earth.
        He will judge the world with righteousness, and the
        peoples with equity.
099:001 Yahweh reigns!  Let the peoples tremble.  He sits enthroned
        among the cherubim.  Let the earth be moved.
099:002 Yahweh is great in Zion.  He is high above all the peoples.
099:003 Let them praise your great and awesome name.  He is Holy!
099:004 The King's strength also loves justice.  You do establish equity.
        You execute justice and righteousness in Jacob.
099:005 Exalt Yahweh our God.  Worship at his footstool.
        He is Holy!
099:006 Moses and Aaron were among his priests, Samuel among those who call
        on his name; they called on Yahweh, and he answered them.
099:007 He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud.  They kept his testimonies,
        the statute that he gave them.
099:008 You answered them, Yahweh our God.  You are a God who forgave them,
        although you took vengeance for their doings.
099:009 Exalt Yahweh, our God.  Worship at his holy hill, for Yahweh,
        our God, is holy!
100:001 <<A Psalm of thanksgiving.>> Shout for joy to Yahweh,
        all you lands!
100:002 Serve Yahweh with gladness.  Come before his presence with singing.
100:003 Know that Yahweh, he is God.  It is he who has made us, and we
        are his.  We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
100:004 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, into his courts with praise.
        Give thanks to him, and bless his name.
100:005 For Yahweh is good.  His loving kindness endures forever,
        his faithfulness to all generations.
101:001 <<A Psalm by David.>> I will sing of loving kindness and justice.
        To you, Yahweh, I will sing praises.
101:002 I will be careful to live a blameless life.  When will you come
        to me?  I will walk within my house with a blameless heart.
101:003 I will set no vile thing before my eyes.  I hate the deeds
        of faithless men.  They will not cling to me.
101:004 A perverse heart will be far from me.  I will have nothing
        to do with evil.
101:005 I will silence whoever secretly slanders his neighbor.
        I won't tolerate one who is haughty and conceited.
101:006 My eyes will be on the faithful of the land, that they may dwell
        with me.  He who walks in a perfect way, he will serve me.
101:007 He who practices deceit won't dwell within my house.
        He who speaks falsehood won't be established before my eyes.
101:008 Morning by morning, I will destroy all the wicked of the land;
        to cut off all the workers of iniquity from Yahweh's city.
102:001 <<A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed and pours out
        his complaint before Yahweh.>> Hear my prayer, Yahweh!  Let my
        cry come to you.
102:002 Don't hide your face from me in the day of my distress.
        Turn your ear to me.  Answer me quickly in the day when I call.
102:003 For my days consume away like smoke.  My bones are burned
        as a firebrand.
102:004 My heart is blighted like grass, and withered, for I forget
        to eat my bread.
102:005 By reason of the voice of my groaning, my bones stick to my skin.
102:006 I am like a pelican of the wilderness.  I have become as an owl
        of the waste places.
102:007 I watch, and have become like a sparrow that is alone
        on the housetop.
102:008 My enemies reproach me all day.  Those who are mad at me use
        my name as a curse.
102:009 For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mixed my drink with tears,
102:010 Because of your indignation and your wrath, for you have taken
        me up, and thrown me away.
102:011 My days are like a long shadow.  I have withered like grass.
102:012 But you, Yahweh, will abide forever; your renown endures
        to all generations.
102:013 You will arise and have mercy on Zion; for it is time to have
        pity on her.  Yes, the set time has come.
102:014 For your servants take pleasure in her stones, and have pity
        on her dust.
102:015 So the nations will fear the name of Yahweh; all the kings
        of the earth your glory.
102:016 For Yahweh has built up Zion.  He has appeared in his glory.
102:017 He has responded to the prayer of the destitute, and has not
        despised their prayer.
102:018 This will be written for the generation to come.
        A people which will be created will praise Yah.
102:019 For he has looked down from the height of his sanctuary.
        From heaven, Yahweh saw the earth;
102:020 to hear the groans of the prisoner; to free those who are
        condemned to death;
102:021 that men may declare the name of Yahweh in Zion, and his
        praise in Jerusalem;
102:022 when the peoples are gathered together, the kingdoms,
        to serve Yahweh.
102:023 He weakened my strength along the course.  He shortened my days.
102:024 I said, "My God, don't take me away in the midst of my days.
        Your years are throughout all generations.
102:025 Of old, you laid the foundation of the earth.  The heavens
        are the work of your hands.
102:026 They will perish, but you will endure.  Yes, all of them will
        wear out like a garment.  You will change them like a cloak,
        and they will be changed.
102:027 But you are the same.  Your years will have no end.
102:028 The children of your servants will continue.  Their seed
        will be established before you."
103:001 <<By David.>> Praise Yahweh, my soul!  All that is within me,
        praise his holy name!
103:002 Praise Yahweh, my soul, and don't forget all his benefits;
103:003 who forgives all your sins; who heals all your diseases;
103:004 who redeems your life from destruction; who crowns you with
        loving kindness and tender mercies;
103:005 who satisfies your desire with good things, so that your youth
        is renewed like the eagle's.
103:006 Yahweh executes righteous acts, and justice for all
        who are oppressed.
103:007 He made known his ways to Moses, his deeds to the children of Israel.
103:008 Yahweh is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant
        in loving kindness.
103:009 He will not always accuse; neither will he stay angry forever.
103:010 He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor repaid us
        for our iniquities.
103:011 For as the heavens are high above the earth, so great is his
        loving kindness toward those who fear him.
103:012 As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed
        our transgressions from us.
103:013 Like a father has compassion on his children, so Yahweh has
        compassion on those who fear him.
103:014 For he knows how we are made.  He remembers that we are dust.
103:015 As for man, his days are like grass.  As a flower of the field,
        so he flourishes.
103:016 For the wind passes over it, and it is gone.  Its place
        remembers it no more.
103:017 But Yahweh's loving kindness is from everlasting to everlasting
        with those who fear him, his righteousness to children's children;
103:018 to those who keep his covenant, to those who remember to
        obey his precepts.
103:019 Yahweh has established his throne in the heavens.
        His kingdom rules over all.
103:020 Praise Yahweh, you angels of his, who are mighty in strength,
        who fulfill his word, obeying the voice of his word.
103:021 Praise Yahweh, all you armies of his, you servants of his,
        who do his pleasure.
103:022 Praise Yahweh, all you works of his, in all places of his dominion.
        Praise Yahweh, my soul!
104:001 Bless Yahweh, my soul.  Yahweh, my God, you are very great.
        You are clothed with honor and majesty.
104:002 He covers himself with light as with a garment.
        He stretches out the heavens like a curtain.
104:003 He lays the beams of his chambers in the waters.
        He makes the clouds his chariot.  He walks on the wings
        of the wind.
104:004 He makes his messengers{or, angels} winds; his servants
        flames of fire.
104:005 He laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not
        be moved forever.
104:006 You covered it with the deep as with a cloak.  The waters
        stood above the mountains.
104:007 At your rebuke they fled.  At the voice of your thunder
        they hurried away.
104:008 The mountains rose, the valleys sank down, to the place
        which you had assigned to them.
104:009 You have set a boundary that they may not pass over;
        that they don't turn again to cover the earth.
104:010 He sends forth springs into the valleys.  They run
        among the mountains.
104:011 They give drink to every animal of the field.  The wild donkeys
        quench their thirst.
104:012 The birds of the sky nest by them.  They sing among the branches.
104:013 He waters the mountains from his chambers.  The earth is filled
        with the fruit of your works.
104:014 He causes the grass to grow for the livestock, and plants for man
        to cultivate, that he may bring forth food out of the earth:
104:015 wine that makes glad the heart of man, oil to make his face
        to shine, and bread that strengthens man's heart.
104:016 Yahweh's trees are well watered, the cedars of Lebanon,
        which he has planted;
104:017 where the birds make their nests.  The stork makes its home
        in the fir trees.
104:018 The high mountains are for the wild goats.  The rocks are
        a refuge for the rock badgers.
104:019 He appointed the moon for seasons.  The sun knows when to set.
104:020 You make darkness, and it is night, in which all the animals
        of the forest prowl.
104:021 The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their
        food from God.
104:022 The sun rises, and they steal away, and lay down in their dens.
104:023 Man goes forth to his work, to his labor until the evening.
104:024 Yahweh, how many are your works!  In wisdom have you made them all.
        The earth is full of your riches.
104:025 There is the sea, great and wide, in which are innumerable
        living things, both small and large animals.
104:026 There the ships go, and leviathan, whom you formed to play there.
104:027 These all wait for you, that you may give them their food
        in due season.
104:028 You give to them; they gather.  You open your hand;
        they are satisfied with good.
104:029 You hide your face:  they are troubled; you take away their breath:
        they die, and return to the dust.
104:030 You send forth your Spirit:  they are created.  You renew
        the face of the ground.
104:031 Let the glory of Yahweh endure forever.  Let Yahweh rejoice
        in his works.
104:032 He looks at the earth, and it trembles.  He touches the mountains,
        and they smoke.
104:033 I will sing to Yahweh as long as I live.  I will sing praise
        to my God while I have any being.
104:034 Let your meditation be sweet to him.  I will rejoice in Yahweh.
104:035 Let sinners be consumed out of the earth.  Let the wicked be no more.
        Bless Yahweh, my soul.  Praise Yah!
105:001 Give thanks to Yahweh!  Call on his name!  Make his doings
        known among the peoples.
105:002 Sing to him, sing praises to him!  Tell of all his marvelous works.
105:003 Glory in his holy name.  Let the heart of those who
        seek Yahweh rejoice.
105:004 Seek Yahweh and his strength.  Seek his face forever more.
105:005 Remember his marvelous works that he has done; his wonders,
        and the judgments of his mouth,
105:006 you seed of Abraham, his servant, you children of Jacob,
        his chosen ones.
105:007 He is Yahweh, our God.  His judgments are in all the earth.
105:008 He has remembered his covenant forever, the word which he commanded
        to a thousand generations,
105:009 the covenant which he made with Abraham, his oath to Isaac,
105:010 and confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute; to Israel
        for an everlasting covenant,
105:011 saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan, the lot
        of your inheritance;"
105:012 when they were but a few men in number, yes, very few,
        and foreigners in it.
105:013 They went about from nation to nation, from one kingdom
        to another people.
105:014 He allowed no one to do them wrong.  Yes, he reproved kings
        for their sakes,
105:015 "Don't touch my anointed ones!  Do my prophets no harm!"
105:016 He called for a famine on the land.  He destroyed the food supplies.
105:017 He sent a man before them.  Joseph was sold for a slave.
105:018 They bruised his feet with shackles.  His neck was locked in irons,
105:019 until the time that his word happened, and Yahweh's word
        proved him true.
105:020 The king sent and freed him; even the ruler of peoples,
        and let him go free.
105:021 He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all of his possessions;
105:022 to discipline his princes at his pleasure, and to teach
        his elders wisdom.
105:023 Israel also came into Egypt.  Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
105:024 He increased his people greatly, and made them stronger
        than their adversaries.
105:025 He turned their heart to hate his people, to conspire
        against his servants.
105:026 He sent Moses, his servant, and Aaron, whom he had chosen.
105:027 They performed miracles among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.
105:028 He sent darkness, and made it dark.  They didn't rebel
        against his words.
105:029 He turned their waters into blood, and killed their fish.
105:030 Their land swarmed with frogs, even in the chambers of their kings.
105:031 He spoke, and swarms of flies came, and lice in all their borders.
105:032 He gave them hail for rain, with lightning in their land.
105:033 He struck their vines and also their fig trees, and shattered
        the trees of their country.
105:034 He spoke, and the locusts came, and the grasshoppers, without number,
105:035 ate up every plant in their land; and ate up the fruit
        of their ground.
105:036 He struck also all the firstborn in their land, the first fruits
        of all their manhood.
105:037 He brought them forth with silver and gold.  There was not
        one feeble person among his tribes.
105:038 Egypt was glad when they departed, for the fear of them had
        fallen on them.
105:039 He spread a cloud for a covering, fire to give light in the night.
105:040 They asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with
        the bread of the sky.
105:041 He opened the rock, and waters gushed out.  They ran as a river
        in the dry places.
105:042 For he remembered his holy word, and Abraham, his servant.
105:043 He brought forth his people with joy, his chosen with singing.
105:044 He gave them the lands of the nations.  They took the labor
        of the peoples in possession,
105:045 that they might keep his statutes, and observe his laws.
        Praise Yah!
106:001 Praise Yahweh!  Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good,
        for his loving kindness endures forever.
106:002 Who can utter the mighty acts of Yahweh, or fully declare
        all his praise?
106:003 Blessed are those who keep justice.  Blessed is one who does
        what is right at all times.
106:004 Remember me, Yahweh, with the favor that you show to your people.
        Visit me with your salvation,
106:005 that I may see the prosperity of your chosen, that I may
        rejoice in the gladness of your nation, that I may glory
        with your inheritance.
106:006 We have sinned with our fathers.  We have committed iniquity.
        We have done wickedly.
106:007 Our fathers didn't understand your wonders in Egypt.  They didn't
        remember the multitude of your loving kindnesses, but were
        rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}.
106:008 Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might
        make his mighty power known.
106:009 He rebuked the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds} also, and it was dried up;
        so he led them through the depths, as through a desert.
106:010 He saved them from the hand of him who hated them, and redeemed
        them from the hand of the enemy.
106:011 The waters covered their adversaries.  There was not one
        of them left.
106:012 Then they believed his words.  They sang his praise.
106:013 They soon forgot his works.  They didn't wait for his counsel,
106:014 but gave in to craving in the desert, and tested God
        in the wasteland.
106:015 He gave them their request, but sent leanness into their soul.
106:016 They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron, Yahweh's saint.
106:017 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered
        the company of Abiram.
106:018 A fire was kindled in their company.  The flame burned
        up the wicked.
106:019 They made a calf in Horeb, and worshiped a molten image.
106:020 Thus they exchanged their glory for an image of a bull
        that eats grass.
106:021 They forgot God, their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt,
106:022 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and awesome things by
        the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}.
106:023 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had Moses,
        his chosen, not stood before him in the breach, to turn away
        his wrath, so that he wouldn't destroy them.
106:024 Yes, they despised the pleasant land.  They didn't believe his word,
106:025 but murmured in their tents, and didn't listen to Yahweh's voice.
106:026 Therefore he swore to them that he would overthrow them
        in the wilderness,
106:027 that he would overthrow their seed among the nations,
        and scatter them in the lands.
106:028 They joined themselves also to Baal Peor, and ate the sacrifices
        of the dead.
106:029 Thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds.
        The plague broke in on them.
106:030 Then Phinehas stood up, and executed judgment, so the
        plague was stopped.
106:031 That was credited to him for righteousness, for all
        generations to come.
106:032 They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, so that Moses
        was troubled for their sakes;
106:033 because they were rebellious against his spirit, he spoke
        rashly with his lips.
106:034 They didn't destroy the peoples, as Yahweh commanded them,
106:035 but mixed themselves with the nations, and learned their works.
106:036 They served their idols, which became a snare to them.
106:037 Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.
106:038 They shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of
        their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan.
        The land was polluted with blood.
106:039 Thus were they defiled with their works, and prostituted
        themselves in their deeds.
106:040 Therefore Yahweh burned with anger against his people.
        He abhorred his inheritance.
106:041 He gave them into the hand of the nations.  Those who hated
        them ruled over them.
106:042 Their enemies also oppressed them.  They were brought into
        subjection under their hand.
106:043 Many times he delivered them, but they were rebellious
        in their counsel, and were brought low in their iniquity.
106:044 Nevertheless he regarded their distress, when he heard their cry.
106:045 He remembered for them his covenant, and repented according
        to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.
106:046 He made them also to be pitied by all those who carried them captive.
106:047 Save us, Yahweh, our God, gather us from among the nations,
        to give thanks to your holy name, to triumph in your praise!
106:048 Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, from everlasting even
        to everlasting!  Let all the people say, "Amen." Praise Yah!
107:001 Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, for his loving
        kindness endures forever.
107:002 Let the redeemed by Yahweh say so, whom he has redeemed from
        the hand of the adversary,
107:003 And gathered out of the lands, from the east and from the west,
        from the north and from the south.
107:004 They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way.
        They found no city to live in.
107:005 Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
107:006 Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble, and he delivered
        them out of their distresses,
107:007 he led them also by a straight way, that they might go to a city
        to live in.
107:008 Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, for his wonderful
        works to the children of men!
107:009 For he satisfies the longing soul.  He fills the hungry
        soul with good.
107:010 Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound
        in affliction and iron,
107:011 because they rebelled against the words of God, and condemned
        the counsel of the Most High.
107:012 Therefore he brought down their heart with labor.
        They fell down, and there was none to help.
107:013 Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble, and he saved them
        out of their distresses.
107:014 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,
        and broke their bonds in sunder.
107:015 Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, for his wonderful
        works to the children of men!
107:016 For he has broken the gates of brass, and cut through bars of iron.
107:017 Fools are afflicted because of their disobedience, and because
        of their iniquities.
107:018 Their soul abhors all kinds of food.  They draw near to
        the gates of death.
107:019 Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble, he saves them out
        of their distresses.
107:020 He sends his word, and heals them, and delivers them
        from their graves.
107:021 Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, for his wonderful
        works to the children of men!
107:022 Let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare
        his works with singing.
107:023 Those who go down to the sea in ships, who do business
        in great waters;
107:024 These see Yahweh's works, and his wonders in the deep.
107:025 For he commands, and raises the stormy wind, which lifts
        up its waves.
107:026 They mount up to the sky; they go down again to the depths.
        Their soul melts away because of trouble.
107:027 They reel back and forth, and stagger like a drunken man,
        and are at their wits' end.
107:028 Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble, and he brings them
        out of their distress.
107:029 He makes the storm a calm, so that its waves are still.
107:030 Then they are glad because it is calm, so he brings them
        to their desired haven.
107:031 Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, for his wonderful
        works for the children of men!
107:032 Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people,
        and praise him in the seat of the elders.
107:033 He turns rivers into a desert, water springs into a thirsty ground,
107:034 and a fruitful land into a salt waste, for the wickedness
        of those who dwell in it.
107:035 He turns a desert into a pool of water, and a dry land
        into water springs.
107:036 There he makes the hungry live, that they may prepare a city
        to live in,
107:037 sow fields, plant vineyards, and reap the fruits of increase.
107:038 He blesses them also, so that they are multiplied greatly.
        He doesn't allow their livestock to decrease.
107:039 Again, they are diminished and bowed down through oppression,
        trouble, and sorrow.
107:040 He pours contempt on princes, and causes them to wander
        in a trackless waste.
107:041 Yet he lifts the needy out of their affliction, and increases
        their families like a flock.
107:042 The upright will see it, and be glad.  All the wicked will
        shut their mouths.
107:043 Whoever is wise will pay attention to these things.
        They will consider the loving kindnesses of Yahweh.
108:001 <<A Song.  A Psalm by David.>> My heart is steadfast, God.
        I will sing and I will make music with my soul.
108:002 Wake up, harp and lyre!  I will wake up the dawn.
108:003 I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations.
        I will sing praises to you among the peoples.
108:004 For your loving kindness is great above the heavens.
        Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.
108:005 Be exalted, God, above the heavens!  Let your glory be over
        all the earth.
108:006 That your beloved may be delivered, save with your right hand,
        and answer us.
108:007 God has spoken from his sanctuary:  "In triumph, I will
        divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of Succoth.
108:008 Gilead is mine.  Manasseh is mine.  Ephraim also is my helmet.
        Judah is my scepter.
108:009 Moab is my wash pot.  I will toss my sandal on Edom.
        I will shout over Philistia."
108:010 Who will bring me into the fortified city?  Who has led
        me to Edom?
108:011 Haven't you rejected us, God?  You don't go forth, God,
        with our armies.
108:012 Give us help against the enemy, for the help of man is vain.
108:013 Through God, we will do valiantly.  For it is he who will tread
        down our enemies.
109:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by David.>> God of my praise,
        don't remain silent,
109:002 for they have opened the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of
        deceit against me.  They have spoken to me with a lying tongue.
109:003 They have also surrounded me with words of hatred, and fought
        against me without a cause.
109:004 In return for my love, they are my adversaries; but I
        am in prayer.
109:005 They have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.
109:006 Set a wicked man over him.  Let an adversary stand at
        his right hand.
109:007 When he is judged, let him come forth guilty.  Let his prayer
        be turned into sin.
109:008 Let his days be few.  Let another take his office.
109:009 Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.
109:010 Let his children be wandering beggars.  Let them be sought
        from their ruins.
109:011 Let the creditor seize all that he has.  Let strangers plunder
        the fruit of his labor.
109:012 Let there be none to extend kindness to him, neither let there
        be any to have pity on his fatherless children.
109:013 Let his posterity be cut off.  In the generation following
        let their name be blotted out.
109:014 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered by Yahweh.
        Don't let the sin of his mother be blotted out.
109:015 Let them be before Yahweh continually, that he may cut off
        the memory of them from the earth;
109:016 because he didn't remember to show kindness, but persecuted
        the poor and needy man, the broken in heart, to kill them.
109:017 Yes, he loved cursing, and it came to him.  He didn't delight
        in blessing, and it was far from him.
109:018 He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment.
        It came into his inward parts like water, like oil into his bones.
109:019 Let it be to him as the clothing with which he covers himself,
        for the belt that is always around him.
109:020 This is the reward of my adversaries from Yahweh, of those
        who speak evil against my soul.
109:021 But deal with me, Yahweh the Lord, for your name's sake,
        because your loving kindness is good, deliver me;
109:022 for I am poor and needy.  My heart is wounded within me.
109:023 I fade away like an evening shadow.  I am shaken off like a locust.
109:024 My knees are weak through fasting.  My body is thin and lacks fat.
109:025 I have also become a reproach to them.  When they see me,
        they shake their head.
109:026 Help me, Yahweh, my God.  Save me according to your loving kindness;
109:027 that they may know that this is your hand; that you, Yahweh,
        have done it.
109:028 They may curse, but you bless.  When they arise, they will
        be shamed, but your servant shall rejoice.
109:029 Let my adversaries be clothed with dishonor.  Let them cover
        themselves with their own shame as with a robe.
109:030 I will give great thanks to Yahweh with my mouth.  Yes, I will
        praise him among the multitude.
109:031 For he will stand at the right hand of the needy, to save him
        from those who judge his soul.
110:001 <<A Psalm by David.>> Yahweh says to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand,
        until I make your enemies your footstool for your feet."
110:002 Yahweh will send forth the rod of your strength out of Zion.
        Rule in the midst of your enemies.
110:003 Your people offer themselves willingly in the day of your power,
        in holy array.  Out of the womb of the morning, you have
        the dew of your youth.
110:004 Yahweh has sworn, and will not change his mind:
        "You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek."
110:005 The Lord is at your right hand.  He will crush kings in the day
        of his wrath.
110:006 He will judge among the nations.  He will heap up dead bodies.
        He will crush the ruler of the whole earth.
110:007 He will drink of the brook in the way; therefore he will lift
        up his head.
111:001 Praise Yah!{Psalm 111 is an acrostic poem, with each verse
        after the initial "Praise Yah!" starting with a letter of
        the alphabet (ordered from Alef to Tav).} I will give thanks
        to Yahweh with my whole heart, in the council of the upright,
        and in the congregation.
111:002 Yahweh's works are great, pondered by all those who delight in them.
111:003 His work is honor and majesty.  His righteousness endures forever.
111:004 He has caused his wonderful works to be remembered.
        Yahweh is gracious and merciful.
111:005 He has given food to those who fear him.  He always
        remembers his covenant.
111:006 He has shown his people the power of his works, in giving them
        the heritage of the nations.
111:007 The works of his hands are truth and justice.
        All his precepts are sure.
111:008 They are established forever and ever.  They are done in
        truth and uprightness.
111:009 He has sent redemption to his people.  He has ordained his
        covenant forever.  His name is holy and awesome!
111:010 The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom.
        All those who do his work have a good understanding.
        His praise endures forever!
112:001 Praise Yah!{Psalm 112 is an acrostic poem, with each verse after
        the initial "Praise Yah!" starting with a letter of the alphabet
        (ordered from Alef to Tav).} Blessed is the man who fears Yahweh,
        who delights greatly in his commandments.
112:002 His seed will be mighty in the land.  The generation of the upright
        will be blessed.
112:003 Wealth and riches are in his house.  His righteousness
        endures forever.
112:004 Light dawns in the darkness for the upright, gracious,
        merciful, and righteous.
112:005 It is well with the man who deals graciously and lends.
        He will maintain his cause in judgment.
112:006 For he will never be shaken.  The righteous will
        be remembered forever.
112:007 He will not be afraid of evil news.  His heart is steadfast,
        trusting in Yahweh.
112:008 His heart is established.  He will not be afraid in the end
        when he sees his adversaries.
112:009 He has dispersed, he has given to the poor.  His righteousness
        endures forever.  His horn will be exalted with honor.
112:010 The wicked will see it, and be grieved.  He shall gnash with
        his teeth, and melt away.  The desire of the wicked will perish.
113:001 Praise Yah!  Praise, you servants of Yahweh, praise the
        name of Yahweh.
113:002 Blessed be the name of Yahweh, from this time forth and forevermore.
113:003 From the rising of the sun to the going down of the same,
        Yahweh's name is to be praised.
113:004 Yahweh is high above all nations, his glory above the heavens.
113:005 Who is like Yahweh, our God, who has his seat on high,
113:006 Who stoops down to see in heaven and in the earth?
113:007 He raises up the poor out of the dust.  Lifts up the needy
        from the ash heap;
113:008 that he may set him with princes, even with the princes
        of his people.
113:009 He settles the barren woman in her home, as a joyful mother
        of children.  Praise Yah!
114:001 When Israel went forth out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from
        a people of foreign language;
114:002 Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion.
114:003 The sea saw it, and fled.  The Jordan was driven back.
114:004 The mountains skipped like rams, the little hills like lambs.
114:005 What was it, you sea, that you fled?  You Jordan,
        that you turned back?
114:006 You mountains, that you skipped like rams; you little hills,
        like lambs?
114:007 Tremble, you earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence
        of the God of Jacob,
114:008 who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint into
        a spring of waters.
115:001 Not to us, Yahweh, not to us, but to your name give glory,
        for your loving kindness, and for your truth's sake.
115:002 Why should the nations say, "Where is their God, now?"
115:003 But our God is in the heavens.  He does whatever he pleases.
115:004 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
115:005 They have mouths, but they don't speak.  They have eyes,
        but they don't see.
115:006 They have ears, but they don't hear.  They have noses,
        but they don't smell.
115:007 They have hands, but they don't feel.  They have feet, but they
        don't walk, neither do they speak through their throat.
115:008 Those who make them will be like them; yes, everyone who
        trusts in them.
115:009 Israel, trust in Yahweh!  He is their help and their shield.
115:010 House of Aaron, trust in Yahweh!  He is their help and their shield.
115:011 You who fear Yahweh, trust in Yahweh!  He is their help
        and their shield.
115:012 Yahweh remembers us.  He will bless us.  He will bless the house
        of Israel.  He will bless the house of Aaron.
115:013 He will bless those who fear Yahweh, both small and great.
115:014 May Yahweh increase you more and more, you and your children.
115:015 Blessed are you by Yahweh, who made heaven and earth.
115:016 The heavens are the heavens of Yahweh; but the earth has
        he given to the children of men.
115:017 The dead don't praise Yah, neither any who go down into silence;
115:018 But we will bless Yah, from this time forth and forevermore.
        Praise Yah!
116:001 I love Yahweh, because he listens to my voice, and my
        cries for mercy.
116:002 Because he has turned his ear to me, therefore I will call
        on him as long as I live.
116:003 The cords of death surrounded me, the pains of Sheol got a hold
        of me.  I found trouble and sorrow.
116:004 Then called I on the name of Yahweh:  "Yahweh, I beg you,
        deliver my soul."
116:005 Gracious is Yahweh, and righteous; yes, our God is merciful.
116:006 Yahweh preserves the simple.  I was brought low, and he saved me.
116:007 Return to your rest, my soul, for Yahweh has dealt
        bountifully with you.
116:008 For you have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears,
        and my feet from falling.
116:009 I will walk before Yahweh in the land of the living.
116:010 I believed, therefore I said, "I was greatly afflicted."
116:011 I said in my haste, "All men are liars."
116:012 What will I give to Yahweh for all his benefits toward me?
116:013 I will take the cup of salvation, and call on the name of Yahweh.
116:014 I will pay my vows to Yahweh, yes, in the presence of
        all his people.
116:015 Precious in the sight of Yahweh is the death of his saints.
116:016 Yahweh, truly I am your servant.  I am your servant, the son
        of your handmaid.  You have freed me from my chains.
116:017 I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will
        call on the name of Yahweh.
116:018 I will pay my vows to Yahweh, yes, in the presence of
        all his people,
116:019 in the courts of Yahweh's house, in the midst of you, Jerusalem.
        Praise Yah!
117:001 Praise Yahweh, all you nations!  Extol him, all you peoples!
117:002 For his loving kindness is great toward us.  Yahweh's faithfulness
        endures forever.  Praise Yah!
118:001 Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, for his loving
        kindness endures forever.
118:002 Let Israel now say that his loving kindness endures forever.
118:003 Let the house of Aaron now say that his loving kindness
        endures forever.
118:004 Now let those who fear Yahweh say that his loving
        kindness endures forever.
118:005 Out of my distress, I called on Yah.  Yah answered me with freedom.
118:006 Yahweh is on my side.  I will not be afraid.  What can man
        do to me?
118:007 Yahweh is on my side among those who help me.  Therefore I
        will look in triumph at those who hate me.
118:008 It is better to take refuge in Yahweh, than to put confidence in man.
118:009 It is better to take refuge in Yahweh, than to put
        confidence in princes.
118:010 All the nations surrounded me, but in the name of Yahweh, I
        cut them off.
118:011 They surrounded me, yes, they surrounded me.  In the name
        of Yahweh I indeed cut them off.
118:012 They surrounded me like bees.  They are quenched like the
        burning thorns.  In the name of Yahweh I cut them off.
118:013 You pushed me back hard, to make me fall, but Yahweh helped me.
118:014 Yah is my strength and song.  He has become my salvation.
118:015 The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of
        the righteous.  "The right hand of Yahweh does valiantly.
118:016 The right hand of Yahweh is exalted!  The right hand of
        Yahweh does valiantly!"
118:017 I will not die, but live, and declare Yah's works.
118:018 Yah has punished me severely, but he has not given me
        over to death.
118:019 Open to me the gates of righteousness.  I will enter into them.
        I will give thanks to Yah.
118:020 This is the gate of Yahweh; the righteous will enter into it.
118:021 I will give thanks to you, for you have answered me, and have
        become my salvation.
118:022 The stone which the builders rejected has become the head
        of the corner.
118:023 This is Yahweh's doing.  It is marvelous in our eyes.
118:024 This is the day that Yahweh has made.  We will rejoice and be
        glad in it!
118:025 Save us now, we beg you, Yahweh!  Yahweh, we beg you,
        send prosperity now.
118:026 Blessed is he who comes in the name of Yahweh!  We have blessed
        you out of the house of Yahweh.
118:027 Yahweh is God, and he has given us light.  Bind the sacrifice
        with cords, even to the horns of the altar.
118:028 You are my God, and I will give thanks to you.
        You are my God, I will exalt you.
118:029 Oh give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, for his loving
        kindness endures forever.
119:001 <<ALEPH>> Blessed are those whose ways are blameless,
        who walk according to Yahweh's law.
119:002 Blessed are those who keep his statutes, who seek him with
        their whole heart.
119:003 Yes, they do nothing wrong.  They walk in his ways.
119:004 You have commanded your precepts, that we should fully obey them.
119:005 Oh that my ways were steadfast to obey your statutes!
119:006 Then I wouldn't be disappointed, when I consider all
        of your commandments.
119:007 I will give thanks to you with uprightness of heart, when I
        learn your righteous judgments.
119:008 I will observe your statutes.  Don't utterly forsake me.
119:009 How can a young man keep his way pure?  By living according
        to your word.
119:010 With my whole heart, I have sought you.  Don't let me wander
        from your commandments.
119:011 I have hidden your word in my heart, that I might not
        sin against you.
119:012 Blessed are you, Yahweh.  Teach me your statutes.
119:013 With my lips, I have declared all the ordinances of your mouth.
119:014 I have rejoiced in the way of your testimonies, as much
        as in all riches.
119:015 I will meditate on your precepts, and consider your ways.
119:016 I will delight myself in your statutes.  I will not
        forget your word.
119:017 Do good to your servant.  I will live and I will obey your word.
119:018 Open my eyes, that I may see wondrous things out of your law.
119:019 I am a stranger on the earth.  Don't hide your commandments from me.
119:020 My soul is consumed with longing for your ordinances at all times.
119:021 You have rebuked the proud who are cursed, who wander
        from your commandments.
119:022 Take reproach and contempt away from me, for I have
        kept your statutes.
119:023 Though princes sit and slander me, your servant will meditate
        on your statutes.
119:024 Indeed your statutes are my delight, and my counselors.
119:025 My soul is laid low in the dust.  Revive me according
        to your word!
119:026 I declared my ways, and you answered me.  Teach me your statutes.
119:027 Let me understand the teaching of your precepts!
        Then I will meditate on your wondrous works.
119:028 My soul is weary with sorrow:  strengthen me according
        to your word.
119:029 Keep me from the way of deceit.  Grant me your law graciously!
119:030 I have chosen the way of truth.  I have set your ordinances
        before me.
119:031 I cling to your statutes, Yahweh.  Don't let me be disappointed.
119:032 I run in the path of your commandments, for you have set
        my heart free.
119:033 Teach me, Yahweh, the way of your statutes.  I will keep them
        to the end.
119:034 Give me understanding, and I will keep your law.  Yes, I will
        obey it with my whole heart.
119:035 Direct me in the path of your commandments, for I delight in them.
119:036 Turn my heart toward your statutes, not toward selfish gain.
119:037 Turn my eyes away from looking at worthless things.
        Revive me in your ways.
119:038 Fulfill your promise to your servant, that you may be feared.
119:039 Take away my disgrace that I dread, for your ordinances are good.
119:040 Behold, I long for your precepts!  Revive me in your righteousness.
119:041 Let your loving kindness also come to me, Yahweh, your salvation,
        according to your word.
119:042 So I will have an answer for him who reproaches me, for I
        trust in your word.
119:043 Don't snatch the word of truth out of my mouth, for I put
        my hope in your ordinances.
119:044 So I will obey your law continually, forever and ever.
119:045 I will walk in liberty, for I have sought your precepts.
119:046 I will also speak of your statutes before kings, and will
        not be disappointed.
119:047 I will delight myself in your commandments, because I love them.
119:048 I reach out my hands for your commandments, which I love.
        I will meditate on your statutes.
119:049 Remember your word to your servant, because you gave me hope.
119:050 This is my comfort in my affliction, for your word has revived me.
119:051 The arrogant mock me excessively, but I don't swerve from your law.
119:052 I remember your ordinances of old, Yahweh, and have comforted myself.
119:053 Indignation has taken hold on me, because of the wicked
        who forsake your law.
119:054 Your statutes have been my songs, in the house where I live.
119:055 I have remembered your name, Yahweh, in the night, and I
        obey your law.
119:056 This is my way, that I keep your precepts.
119:057 Yahweh is my portion.  I promised to obey your words.
119:058 I sought your favor with my whole heart.  Be merciful to me
        according to your word.
119:059 I considered my ways, and turned my steps to your statutes.
119:060 I will hurry, and not delay, to obey your commandments.
119:061 The ropes of the wicked bind me, but I won't forget your law.
119:062 At midnight I will rise to give thanks to you, because of
        your righteous ordinances.
119:063 I am a friend of all those who fear you, of those who
        observe your precepts.
119:064 The earth is full of your loving kindness, Yahweh.
        Teach me your statutes.
119:065 Do good to your servant, according to your word, Yahweh.
119:066 Teach me good judgment and knowledge, for I believe
        in your commandments.
119:067 Before I was afflicted, I went astray; but now I observe your word.
119:068 You are good, and do good.  Teach me your statutes.
119:069 The proud have smeared a lie upon me.  With my whole heart,
        I will keep your precepts.
119:070 Their heart is as callous as the fat, but I delight in your law.
119:071 It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I may
        learn your statutes.
119:072 The law of your mouth is better to me than thousands of pieces
        of gold and silver.
119:073 Your hands have made me and formed me.  Give me understanding,
        that I may learn your commandments.
119:074 Those who fear you will see me and be glad, because I have put
        my hope in your word.
119:075 Yahweh, I know that your judgments are righteous, that in
        faithfulness you have afflicted me.
119:076 Please let your loving kindness be for my comfort, according to
        your word to your servant.
119:077 Let your tender mercies come to me, that I may live;
        for your law is my delight.
119:078 Let the proud be disappointed, for they have overthrown
        me wrongfully.  I will meditate on your precepts.
119:079 Let those who fear you turn to me.  They will know your statutes.
119:080 Let my heart be blameless toward your decrees, that I may
        not be disappointed.
119:081 My soul faints for your salvation.  I hope in your word.
119:082 My eyes fail for your word.  I say, "When will you comfort me?"
119:083 For I have become like a wineskin in the smoke.
        I don't forget your statutes.
119:084 How many are the days of your servant?  When will you execute
        judgment on those who persecute me?
119:085 The proud have dug pits for me, contrary to your law.
119:086 All of your commandments are faithful.  They persecute
        me wrongfully.  Help me!
119:087 They had almost wiped me from the earth, but I didn't
        forsake your precepts.
119:088 Preserve my life according to your loving kindness, so I
        will obey the statutes of your mouth.
119:089 Yahweh, your word is settled in heaven forever.
119:090 Your faithfulness is to all generations.  You have established
        the earth, and it remains.
119:091 Your laws remain to this day, for all things serve you.
119:092 Unless your law had been my delight, I would have perished
        in my affliction.
119:093 I will never forget your precepts, for with them,
        you have revived me.
119:094 I am yours.  Save me, for I have sought your precepts.
119:095 The wicked have waited for me, to destroy me.
        I will consider your statutes.
119:096 I have seen a limit to all perfection, but your commands
        are boundless.
119:097 How I love your law!  It is my meditation all day.
119:098 Your commandments make me wiser than my enemies, for your
        commandments are always with me.
119:099 I have more understanding than all my teachers, for your
        testimonies are my meditation.
119:100 I understand more than the aged, because I have kept your precepts.
119:101 I have kept my feet from every evil way, that I might
        observe your word.
119:102 I have not turned aside from your ordinances, for you
        have taught me.
119:103 How sweet are your promises to my taste, more than honey
        to my mouth!
119:104 Through your precepts, I get understanding; therefore I hate
        every false way.
119:105 Your word is a lamp to my feet, and a light for my path.
119:106 I have sworn, and have confirmed it, that I will obey
        your righteous ordinances.
119:107 I am afflicted very much.  Revive me, Yahweh, according to your word.
119:108 Accept, I beg you, the willing offerings of my mouth.
        Yahweh, teach me your ordinances.
119:109 My soul is continually in my hand, yet I won't forget your law.
119:110 The wicked have laid a snare for me, yet I haven't gone astray
        from your precepts.
119:111 I have taken your testimonies as a heritage forever, for they
        are the joy of my heart.
119:112 I have set my heart to perform your statutes forever,
        even to the end.
119:113 I hate double-minded men, but I love your law.
119:114 You are my hiding place and my shield.  I hope in your word.
119:115 Depart from me, you evildoers, that I may keep the commandments
        of my God.
119:116 Uphold me according to your word, that I may live.
        Let me not be ashamed of my hope.
119:117 Hold me up, and I will be safe, and will have respect for
        your statutes continually.
119:118 You reject all those who stray from your statutes, for their
        deceit is in vain.
119:119 You put away all the wicked of the earth like dross.
        Therefore I love your testimonies.
119:120 My flesh trembles for fear of you.  I am afraid of your judgments.
119:121 I have done what is just and righteous.  Don't leave me
        to my oppressors.
119:122 Ensure your servant's well-being. Don't let the proud oppress me.
119:123 My eyes fail looking for your salvation, for your righteous word.
119:124 Deal with your servant according to your loving kindness.
        Teach me your statutes.
119:125 I am your servant.  Give me understanding, that I may
        know your testimonies.
119:126 It is time to act, Yahweh, for they break your law.
119:127 Therefore I love your commandments more than gold, yes,
        more than pure gold.
119:128 Therefore I consider all of your precepts to be right.
        I hate every false way.
119:129 Your testimonies are wonderful, therefore my soul keeps them.
119:130 The entrance of your words gives light.  It gives understanding
        to the simple.
119:131 I opened my mouth wide and panted, for I longed
        for your commandments.
119:132 Turn to me, and have mercy on me, as you always do to those
        who love your name.
119:133 Establish my footsteps in your word.  Don't let any iniquity
        have dominion over me.
119:134 Redeem me from the oppression of man, so I will observe
        your precepts.
119:135 Make your face shine on your servant.  Teach me your statutes.
119:136 Streams of tears run down my eyes, because they don't
        observe your law.
119:137 You are righteous, Yahweh.  Your judgments are upright.
119:138 You have commanded your statutes in righteousness.
        They are fully trustworthy.
119:139 My zeal wears me out, because my enemies ignore your words.
119:140 Your promises have been thoroughly tested, and your
        servant loves them.
119:141 I am small and despised.  I don't forget your precepts.
119:142 Your righteousness is an everlasting righteousness.
        Your law is truth.
119:143 Trouble and anguish have taken hold of me.  Your commandments
        are my delight.
119:144 Your testimonies are righteous forever.  Give me understanding,
        that I may live.
119:145 I have called with my whole heart.  Answer me, Yahweh!  I will
        keep your statutes.
119:146 I have called to you.  Save me!  I will obey your statutes.
119:147 I rise before dawn and cry for help.  I put my hope in your words.
119:148 My eyes stay open through the night watches, that I might
        meditate on your word.
119:149 Hear my voice according to your loving kindness.
        Revive me, Yahweh, according to your ordinances.
119:150 They draw near who follow after wickedness.  They are far
        from your law.
119:151 You are near, Yahweh.  All your commandments are truth.
119:152 Of old I have known from your testimonies, that you have
        founded them forever.
119:153 Consider my affliction, and deliver me, for I don't forget your law.
119:154 Plead my cause, and redeem me!  Revive me according to your promise.
119:155 Salvation is far from the wicked, for they don't seek your statutes.
119:156 Great are your tender mercies, Yahweh.  Revive me according
        to your ordinances.
119:157 Many are my persecutors and my adversaries.  I haven't swerved
        from your testimonies.
119:158 I look at the faithless with loathing, because they don't
        observe your word.
119:159 Consider how I love your precepts.  Revive me, Yahweh, according to
        your loving kindness.
119:160 All of your words are truth.  Every one of your righteous
        ordinances endures forever.
119:161 Princes have persecuted me without a cause, but my heart stands
        in awe of your words.
119:162 I rejoice at your word, as one who finds great spoil.
119:163 I hate and abhor falsehood.  I love your law.
119:164 Seven times a day, I praise you, because of your
        righteous ordinances.
119:165 Those who love your law have great peace.  Nothing causes
        them to stumble.
119:166 I have hoped for your salvation, Yahweh.  I have
        done your commandments.
119:167 My soul has observed your testimonies.  I love them exceedingly.
119:168 I have obeyed your precepts and your testimonies, for all my
        ways are before you.
119:169 Let my cry come before you, Yahweh.  Give me understanding
        according to your word.
119:170 Let my supplication come before you.  Deliver me according
        to your word.
119:171 Let my lips utter praise, for you teach me your statutes.
119:172 Let my tongue sing of your word, for all your commandments
        are righteousness.
119:173 Let your hand be ready to help me, for I have chosen your precepts.
119:174 I have longed for your salvation, Yahweh.  Your law is my delight.
119:175 Let my soul live, that I may praise you.  Let your
        ordinances help me.
119:176 I have gone astray like a lost sheep.  Seek your servant,
        for I don't forget your commandments.
120:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> In my distress, I cried to Yahweh.
        He answered me.
120:002 Deliver my soul, Yahweh, from lying lips, from a deceitful tongue.
120:003 What will be given to you, and what will be done more to you,
        you deceitful tongue?
120:004 Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.
120:005 Woe is me, that I live in Meshech, that I dwell among
        the tents of Kedar!
120:006 My soul has had her dwelling too long with him who hates peace.
120:007 I am for peace, but when I speak, they are for war.
121:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> I will lift up my eyes to the hills.
        Where does my help come from?
121:002 My help comes from Yahweh, who made heaven and earth.
121:003 He will not allow your foot to be moved.  He who keeps you
        will not slumber.
121:004 Behold, he who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.
121:005 Yahweh is your keeper.  Yahweh is your shade on your right hand.
121:006 The sun will not harm you by day, nor the moon by night.
121:007 Yahweh will keep you from all evil.  He will keep your soul.
121:008 Yahweh will keep your going out and your coming in, from this
        time forth, and forevermore.
122:001 <<A Song of Ascents.  By David.>> I was glad when they said to me,
        "Let's go to Yahweh's house!"
122:002 Our feet are standing within your gates, Jerusalem;
122:003 Jerusalem, that is built as a city that is compact together;
122:004 where the tribes go up, even Yah's tribes, according to an
        ordinance for Israel, to give thanks to the name of Yahweh.
122:005 For there are set thrones for judgment, the thrones
        of David's house.
122:006 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem.  Those who love you will prosper.
122:007 Peace be within your walls, and prosperity within your palaces.
122:008 For my brothers' and companions' sakes, I will now say,
        "Peace be within you."
122:009 For the sake of the house of Yahweh our God, I will seek your good.
123:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> To you I do lift up my eyes, you who sit
        in the heavens.
123:002 Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master,
        as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress; so our eyes
        look to Yahweh, our God, until he has mercy on us.
123:003 Have mercy on us, Yahweh, have mercy on us, for we have
        endured much contempt.
123:004 Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scoffing of those who
        are at ease, with the contempt of the proud.
124:001 <<A Song of Ascents.  By David.>> If it had not been Yahweh
        who was on our side, let Israel now say,
124:002 if it had not been Yahweh who was on our side, when men rose
        up against us;
124:003 then they would have swallowed us up alive, when their wrath
        was kindled against us;
124:004 then the waters would have overwhelmed us, the stream would
        have gone over our soul;
124:005 then the proud waters would have gone over our soul.
124:006 Blessed be Yahweh, who has not given us as a prey to their teeth.
124:007 Our soul has escaped like a bird out of the fowler's snare.
        The snare is broken, and we have escaped.
124:008 Our help is in the name of Yahweh, who made heaven and earth.
125:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> Those who trust in Yahweh are as Mount Zion,
        which can't be moved, but remains forever.
125:002 As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so Yahweh surrounds his
        people from this time forth and forevermore.
125:003 For the scepter of wickedness won't remain over the allotment
        of the righteous; so that the righteous won't use their hands
        to do evil.
125:004 Do good, Yahweh, to those who are good, to those who are upright
        in their hearts.
125:005 But as for those who turn aside to their crooked ways,
        Yahweh will lead them away with the workers of iniquity.
        Peace be on Israel.
126:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> When Yahweh brought back those who returned
        to Zion, we were like those who dream.
126:002 Then our mouth was filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing.
        Then they said among the nations, "Yahweh has done great
        things for them."
126:003 Yahweh has done great things for us, and we are glad.
126:004 Restore our fortunes again, Yahweh, like the streams in the Negev.
126:005 Those who sow in tears will reap in joy.
126:006 He who goes out weeping, carrying seed for sowing, will certainly
        come again with joy, carrying his sheaves.
127:001 <<A Song of Ascents.  By Solomon.>> Unless Yahweh builds
        the house, they labor in vain who build it.  Unless Yahweh
        watches over the city, the watchman guards it in vain.
127:002 It is vain for you to rise up early, to stay up late,
        eating the bread of toil; for he gives sleep to his loved ones.
127:003 Behold, children are a heritage of Yahweh.  The fruit of the womb
        is his reward.
127:004 As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the children of youth.
127:005 Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them.
        They won't be disappointed when they speak with their enemies
        in the gate.
128:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> Blessed is everyone who fears Yahweh,
        who walks in his ways.
128:002 For you will eat the labor of your hands.  You will be happy,
        and it will be well with you.
128:003 Your wife will be as a fruitful vine, in the innermost
        parts of your house; your children like olive plants,
        around your table.
128:004 Behold, thus is the man blessed who fears Yahweh.
128:005 May Yahweh bless you out of Zion, and may you see the good
        of Jerusalem all the days of your life.
128:006 Yes, may you see your children's children.  Peace be upon Israel.
129:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> Many times they have afflicted me
        from my youth up.  Let Israel now say,
129:002 many times they have afflicted me from my youth up, yet they
        have not prevailed against me.
129:003 The plowers plowed on my back.  They made their furrows long.
129:004 Yahweh is righteous.  He has cut apart the cords of the wicked.
129:005 Let them be disappointed and turned backward, all those
        who hate Zion.
129:006 Let them be as the grass on the housetops, which withers
        before it grows up;
129:007 with which the reaper doesn't fill his hand, nor he who
        binds sheaves, his bosom.
129:008 Neither do those who go by say, "The blessing of Yahweh be on you.
        We bless you in the name of Yahweh."
130:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> Out of the depths I have cried
        to you, Yahweh.
130:002 Lord, hear my voice.  Let your ears be attentive to the voice
        of my petitions.
130:003 If you, Yah, kept a record of sins, Lord, who could stand?
130:004 But there is forgiveness with you, therefore you are feared.
130:005 I wait for Yahweh.  My soul waits.  I hope in his word.
130:006 My soul longs for the Lord more than watchmen long for the morning;
        more than watchmen for the morning.
130:007 Israel, hope in Yahweh, for with Yahweh there is loving kindness.
        With him is abundant redemption.
130:008 He will redeem Israel from all their sins.
131:001 <<A Song of Ascents.  By David.>> Yahweh, my heart isn't haughty,
        nor my eyes lofty; nor do I concern myself with great matters,
        or things too wonderful for me.
131:002 Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul, like a weaned child
        with his mother, like a weaned child is my soul within me.
131:003 Israel, hope in Yahweh, from this time forth and forevermore.
132:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> Yahweh, remember David and all his affliction,
132:002 how he swore to Yahweh, and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:
132:003 "Surely I will not come into the structure of my house,
        nor go up into my bed;
132:004 I will not give sleep to my eyes, or slumber to my eyelids;
132:005 until I find out a place for Yahweh, a dwelling for the
        Mighty One of Jacob."
132:006 Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah.  We found it in the
        field of Jaar:
132:007 "We will go into his dwelling place.  We will worship
        at his footstool.
132:008 Arise, Yahweh, into your resting place; you, and the ark
        of your strength.
132:009 Let your priest be clothed with righteousness.  Let your saints
        shout for joy!"
132:010 For your servant David's sake, don't turn away the face
        of your anointed one.
132:011 Yahweh has sworn to David in truth.  He will not turn from it:
        "I will set the fruit of your body on your throne.
132:012 If your children will keep my covenant, my testimony
        that I will teach them, their children also will sit on
        your throne forevermore."
132:013 For Yahweh has chosen Zion.  He has desired it for his habitation.
132:014 "This is my resting place forever.  Here I will live, for I
        have desired it.
132:015 I will abundantly bless her provision.  I will satisfy her
        poor with bread.
132:016 Her priests I will also clothe with salvation.  Her saints
        will shout aloud for joy.
132:017 There I will make the horn of David to bud.  I have ordained
        a lamp for my anointed.
132:018 I will clothe his enemies with shame, but on himself,
        his crown will be resplendent."
133:001 <<A Song of Ascents.  By David.>> See how good and how pleasant
        it is for brothers to live together in unity!
133:002 It is like the precious oil on the head, that ran down on the beard,
        even Aaron's beard; that came down on the edge of his robes;
133:003 like the dew of Hermon, that comes down on the hills of Zion:
        for there Yahweh gives the blessing, even life forevermore.
134:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> Look!  Praise Yahweh, all you servants
        of Yahweh, who stand by night in Yahweh's house!
134:002 Lift up your hands in the sanctuary.  Praise Yahweh!
134:003 May Yahweh bless you from Zion; even he who made heaven and earth.
135:001 Praise Yah!  Praise the name of Yahweh!  Praise him,
        you servants of Yahweh,
135:002 you who stand in the house of Yahweh, in the courts of
        our God's house.
135:003 Praise Yah, for Yahweh is good.  Sing praises to his name,
        for that is pleasant.
135:004 For Yah has chosen Jacob for himself; Israel for his own possession.
135:005 For I know that Yahweh is great, that our Lord is above all gods.
135:006 Whatever Yahweh pleased, that he has done, in heaven and in earth,
        in the seas and in all deeps;
135:007 who causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth;
        who makes lightnings with the rain; who brings forth the wind
        out of his treasuries;
135:008 Who struck the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and animal;
135:009 Who sent signs and wonders into the midst of you, Egypt, on Pharaoh,
        and on all his servants;
135:010 who struck many nations, and killed mighty kings,
135:011 Sihon king of the Amorites, Og king of Bashan, and all
        the kingdoms of Canaan,
135:012 and gave their land for a heritage, a heritage to Israel, his people.
135:013 Your name, Yahweh, endures forever; your renown, Yahweh,
        throughout all generations.
135:014 For Yahweh will judge his people, and have compassion
        on his servants.
135:015 The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work
        of men's hands.
135:016 They have mouths, but they can't speak.  They have eyes,
        but they can't see.
135:017 They have ears, but they can't hear; neither is there any breath
        in their mouths.
135:018 Those who make them will be like them; yes, everyone who
        trusts in them.
135:019 House of Israel, praise Yahweh!  House of Aaron, praise Yahweh!
135:020 House of Levi, praise Yahweh!  You who fear Yahweh, praise Yahweh!
135:021 Blessed be Yahweh from Zion, Who dwells at Jerusalem.
        Praise Yah!
136:001 Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good; for his loving
        kindness endures forever.
136:002 Give thanks to the God of gods; for his loving kindness
        endures forever.
136:003 Give thanks to the Lord of lords; for his loving
        kindness endures forever:
136:004 To him who alone does great wonders; for his loving
        kindness endures forever:
136:005 To him who by understanding made the heavens; for his loving
        kindness endures forever:
136:006 To him who spread out the earth above the waters; for his loving
        kindness endures forever:
136:007 To him who made the great lights; for his loving
        kindness endures forever:
136:008 The sun to rule by day; for his loving kindness endures forever;
136:009 The moon and stars to rule by night; for his loving
        kindness endures forever:
136:010 To him who struck down the Egyptian firstborn; for his loving
        kindness endures forever;
136:011 And brought out Israel from among them; for his loving
        kindness endures forever;
136:012 With a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm; for his loving
        kindness endures forever:
136:013 To him who divided the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds} apart;
        for his loving kindness endures forever;
136:014 And made Israel to pass through the midst of it; for his loving
        kindness endures forever;
136:015 But overthrew Pharaoh and his army in the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds};
        for his loving kindness endures forever:
136:016 To him who led his people through the wilderness; for his loving
        kindness endures forever:
136:017 To him who struck great kings; for his loving kindness
        endures forever;
136:018 And killed mighty kings; for his loving kindness endures forever:
136:019 Sihon king of the Amorites; for his loving kindness endures forever;
136:020 Og king of Bashan; for his loving kindness endures forever;
136:021 And gave their land as an inheritance; for his loving
        kindness endures forever;
136:022 Even a heritage to Israel his servant; for his loving
        kindness endures forever:
136:023 Who remembered us in our low estate; for his loving
        kindness endures forever;
136:024 And has delivered us from our adversaries; for his loving
        kindness endures forever:
136:025 Who gives food to every creature; for his loving
        kindness endures forever.
136:026 Oh give thanks to the God of heaven; for his loving
        kindness endures forever.
137:001 By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down.  Yes, we wept,
        when we remembered Zion.
137:002 On the willows in the midst of it, we hung up our harps.
137:003 For there, those who led us captive asked us for songs.
        Those who tormented us demanded songs of joy:  "Sing us one
        of the songs of Zion!"
137:004 How can we sing Yahweh's song in a foreign land?
137:005 If I forget you, Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its skill.
137:006 Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth if I don't remember you;
        if I don't prefer Jerusalem above my chief joy.
137:007 Remember, Yahweh, against the children of Edom, the day of Jerusalem;
        who said, "Raze it!  Raze it even to its foundation!"
137:008 Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, he will be happy
        who rewards you, as you have served us.
137:009 Happy shall he be, who takes and dashes your little ones
        against the rock.
138:001 <<By David.>> I will give you thanks with my whole heart.
        Before the gods, I will sing praises to you.
138:002 I will bow down toward your holy temple, and give thanks
        to your Name for your loving kindness and for your truth;
        for you have exalted your Name and your Word above all.
138:003 In the day that I called, you answered me.  You encouraged me
        with strength in my soul.
138:004 All the kings of the earth will give you thanks, Yahweh, for they
        have heard the words of your mouth.
138:005 Yes, they will sing of the ways of Yahweh; for great
        is Yahweh's glory.
138:006 For though Yahweh is high, yet he looks after the lowly;
        but the proud, he knows from afar.
138:007 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you will revive me.
        You will stretch forth your hand against the wrath of my enemies.
        Your right hand will save me.
138:008 Yahweh will fulfill that which concerns me; your loving
        kindness, Yahweh, endures forever.  Don't forsake the works
        of your own hands.
139:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by David.>> Yahweh,
        you have searched me, and you know me.
139:002 You know my sitting down and my rising up.  You perceive
        my thoughts from afar.
139:003 You search out my path and my lying down, and are acquainted
        with all my ways.
139:004 For there is not a word on my tongue, but, behold, Yahweh,
        you know it altogether.
139:005 You hem me in behind and before.  You laid your hand on me.
139:006 This knowledge is beyond me.  It's lofty.  I can't attain it.
139:007 Where could I go from your Spirit?  Or where could I flee
        from your presence?
139:008 If I ascend up into heaven, you are there.  If I make my bed
        in Sheol, behold, you are there!
139:009 If I take the wings of the dawn, and settle in the uttermost
        parts of the sea;
139:010 Even there your hand will lead me, and your right hand
        will hold me.
139:011 If I say, "Surely the darkness will overwhelm me; the light
        around me will be night;"
139:012 even the darkness doesn't hide from you, but the night shines
        as the day.  The darkness is like light to you.
139:013 For you formed my inmost being.  You knit me together in
        my mother's womb.
139:014 I will give thanks to you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
        Your works are wonderful.  My soul knows that very well.
139:015 My frame wasn't hidden from you, when I was made in secret,
        woven together in the depths of the earth.
139:016 Your eyes saw my body.  In your book they were all written,
        the days that were ordained for me, when as yet there were
        none of them.
139:017 How precious to me are your thoughts, God!  How vast is
        the sum of them!
139:018 If I would count them, they are more in number than the sand.
        When I wake up, I am still with you.
139:019 If only you, God, would kill the wicked.  Get away from me,
        you bloodthirsty men!
139:020 For they speak against you wickedly.  Your enemies take your
        name in vain.
139:021 Yahweh, don't I hate those who hate you?  Am I not grieved
        with those who rise up against you?
139:022 I hate them with perfect hatred.  They have become my enemies.
139:023 Search me, God, and know my heart.  Try me, and know my thoughts.
139:024 See if there is any wicked way in me, and lead me in
        the everlasting way.
140:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by David.>> Deliver me,
        Yahweh, from the evil man.  Preserve me from the violent man;
140:002 those who devise mischief in their hearts.  They continually
        gather themselves together for war.
140:003 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent.
        Viper's poison is under their lips.  Selah.
140:004 Yahweh, keep me from the hands of the wicked.  Preserve me
        from the violent men who have determined to trip my feet.
140:005 The proud have hidden a snare for me, they have spread the cords
        of a net by the path.  They have set traps for me.  Selah.
140:006 I said to Yahweh, "You are my God."  Listen to the cry
        of my petitions, Yahweh.
140:007 Yahweh, the Lord, the strength of my salvation, you have covered
        my head in the day of battle.
140:008 Yahweh, don't grant the desires of the wicked.  Don't let
        their evil plans succeed, or they will become proud.  Selah.
140:009 As for the head of those who surround me, let the mischief
        of their own lips cover them.
140:010 Let burning coals fall on them.  Let them be thrown into the fire,
        into miry pits, from where they never rise.
140:011 An evil speaker won't be established in the earth.
        Evil will hunt the violent man to overthrow him.
140:012 I know that Yahweh will maintain the cause of the afflicted,
        and justice for the needy.
140:013 Surely the righteous will give thanks to your name.
        The upright will dwell in your presence.
141:001 <<A Psalm by David.>> Yahweh, I have called on you.
        Come to me quickly!  Listen to my voice when I call to you.
141:002 Let my prayer be set before you like incense; the lifting up
        of my hands like the evening sacrifice.
141:003 Set a watch, Yahweh, before my mouth.  Keep the door of my lips.
141:004 Don't incline my heart to any evil thing, to practice deeds
        of wickedness with men who work iniquity.  Don't let me eat
        of their delicacies.
141:005 Let the righteous strike me, it is kindness; let him reprove me,
        it is like oil on the head; don't let my head refuse it;
        Yet my prayer is always against evil deeds.
141:006 Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock.
        They will hear my words, for they are well spoken.
141:007 "As when one plows and breaks up the earth, our bones are
        scattered at the mouth of Sheol."
141:008 For my eyes are on you, Yahweh, the Lord.  In you, I take refuge.
        Don't leave my soul destitute.
141:009 Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me,
        from the traps of the workers of iniquity.
141:010 Let the wicked fall together into their own nets, while I pass by.
142:001 <<A contemplation by David, when he was in the cave.
        A Prayer.>> I cry with my voice to Yahweh.  With my voice,
        I ask Yahweh for mercy.
142:002 I pour out my complaint before him.  I tell him my troubles.
142:003 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, you knew my path.
        In the way in which I walk, they have hidden a snare for me.
142:004 Look on my right, and see; for there is no one who is concerned
        for me.  Refuge has fled from me.  No one cares for my soul.
142:005 I cried to you, Yahweh.  I said, "You are my refuge, my portion
        in the land of the living."
142:006 Listen to my cry, for I am in desperate need.  deliver me
        from my persecutors, For they are stronger than me.
142:007 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks to your name.
        The righteous will surround me, for you will be good to me.
143:001 <<A Psalm by David.>> Hear my prayer, Yahweh.  Listen to
        my petitions.  In your faithfulness and righteousness, relieve me.
143:002 Don't enter into judgment with your servant, for in your sight
        no man living is righteous.
143:003 For the enemy pursues my soul.  He has struck my life
        down to the ground.  He has made me live in dark places,
        as those who have been long dead.
143:004 Therefore my spirit is overwhelmed within me.  My heart within
        me is desolate.
143:005 I remember the days of old.  I meditate on all your doings.
        I contemplate the work of your hands.
143:006 I spread forth my hands to you.  My soul thirsts for you,
        like a parched land.  Selah.
143:007 Hurry to answer me, Yahweh.  My spirit fails.  Don't hide
        your face from me, so that I don't become like those who go
        down into the pit.
143:008 Cause me to hear your loving kindness in the morning, for I
        trust in you.  Cause me to know the way in which I should walk,
        for I lift up my soul to you.
143:009 Deliver me, Yahweh, from my enemies.  I flee to you to hide me.
143:010 Teach me to do your will, for you are my God.  Your Spirit is good.
        Lead me in the land of uprightness.
143:011 Revive me, Yahweh, for your name's sake.  In your righteousness,
        bring my soul out of trouble.
143:012 In your loving kindness, cut off my enemies, and destroy all
        those who afflict my soul, For I am your servant.
144:001 <<By David.>> Blessed be Yahweh, my rock, who teaches my hands
        to war, and my fingers to battle:
144:002 my loving kindness, my fortress, my high tower, my deliverer,
        my shield, and he in whom I take refuge; who subdues my
        people under me.
144:003 Yahweh, what is man, that you care for him?  Or the son of man,
        that you think of him?
144:004 Man is like a breath.  His days are like a shadow that passes away.
144:005 Part your heavens, Yahweh, and come down.  Touch the mountains,
        and they will smoke.
144:006 Throw out lightning, and scatter them.  Send out your arrows,
        and rout them.
144:007 Stretch out your hand from above, rescue me, and deliver me
        out of great waters, out of the hands of foreigners;
144:008 whose mouths speak deceit, Whose right hand is a right
        hand of falsehood.
144:009 I will sing a new song to you, God.  On a ten-stringed lyre,
        I will sing praises to you.
144:010 You are he who gives salvation to kings, who rescues David,
        his servant, from the deadly sword.
144:011 Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hands of foreigners,
        whose mouths speak deceit, whose right hand is a right
        hand of falsehood.
144:012 Then our sons will be like well-nurtured plants, our daughters
        like pillars carved to adorn a palace.
144:013 Our barns are full, filled with all kinds of provision.
        Our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields.
144:014 Our oxen will pull heavy loads.  There is no breaking in,
        and no going away, and no outcry in our streets.
144:015 Happy are the people who are in such a situation.
        Happy are the people whose God is Yahweh.  {}
145:001 <<A praise psalm by David.This is an acrostic psalm,
        with every verse (including the second half of verse 13)
        starting with a consecutive letter of the Hebrew alphabet.>>
        I will exalt you, my God, the King.  I will praise your name
        forever and ever.
145:002 Every day I will praise you.  I will extol your name
        forever and ever.
145:003 Great is Yahweh, and greatly to be praised!
        His greatness is unsearchable.
145:004 One generation will commend your works to another, and will
        declare your mighty acts.
145:005 Of the glorious majesty of your honor, of your wondrous works,
        I will meditate.
145:006 Men will speak of the might of your awesome acts.
        I will declare your greatness.
145:007 They will utter the memory of your great goodness, and will
        sing of your righteousness.
145:008 Yahweh is gracious, merciful, slow to anger, and of
        great loving kindness.
145:009 Yahweh is good to all.  His tender mercies are over all his works.
145:010 All your works will give thanks to you, Yahweh.  Your saints
        will extol you.
145:011 They will speak of the glory of your kingdom, and talk
        about your power;
145:012 to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, the glory
        of the majesty of his kingdom.
145:013 Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom.  Your dominion endures
        throughout all generations.  Yahweh is faithful in all his words,
        and loving in all his deeds.{Some manuscripts omit these
        last two lines.}
145:014 Yahweh upholds all who fall, and raises up all those who
        are bowed down.
145:015 The eyes of all wait for you.  You give them their food
        in due season.
145:016 You open your hand, and satisfy the desire of every living thing.
145:017 Yahweh is righteous in all his ways, and gracious in all his works.
145:018 Yahweh is near to all those who call on him, to all who call
        on him in truth.
145:019 He will fulfill the desire of those who fear him.
        He also will hear their cry, and will save them.
145:020 Yahweh preserves all those who love him, but all the wicked
        he will destroy.
145:021 My mouth will speak the praise of Yahweh.  Let all flesh bless
        his holy name forever and ever.
146:001 Praise Yah!  Praise Yahweh, my soul.
146:002 While I live, I will praise Yahweh.  I will sing praises
        to my God as long as I exist.
146:003 Don't put your trust in princes, each a son of man in whom
        there is no help.
146:004 His spirit departs, and he returns to the earth.
        In that very day, his thoughts perish.
146:005 Happy is he who has the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope
        is in Yahweh, his God:
146:006 who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them;
        who keeps truth forever;
146:007 who executes justice for the oppressed; who gives food to the hungry.
        Yahweh frees the prisoners.
146:008 Yahweh opens the eyes of the blind.  Yahweh raises up those
        who are bowed down.  Yahweh loves the righteous.
146:009 Yahweh preserves the foreigners.  He upholds the fatherless
        and widow, but the way of the wicked he turns upside down.
146:010 Yahweh will reign forever; your God, O Zion, to all generations.
        Praise Yah!
147:001 Praise Yah, for it is good to sing praises to our God;
        for it is pleasant and fitting to praise him.
147:002 Yahweh builds up Jerusalem.  He gathers together the
        outcasts of Israel.
147:003 He heals the broken in heart, and binds up their wounds.
147:004 He counts the number of the stars.  He calls them all
        by their names.
147:005 Great is our Lord, and mighty in power.  His understanding
        is infinite.
147:006 Yahweh upholds the humble.  He brings the wicked down
        to the ground.
147:007 Sing to Yahweh with thanksgiving.  Sing praises on the harp
        to our God,
147:008 who covers the sky with clouds, who prepares rain for the earth,
        who makes grass grow on the mountains.
147:009 He provides food for the livestock, and for the young ravens
        when they call.
147:010 He doesn't delight in the strength of the horse.
        He takes no pleasure in the legs of a man.
147:011 Yahweh takes pleasure in those who fear him, in those who hope
        in his loving kindness.
147:012 Praise Yahweh, Jerusalem!  Praise your God, Zion!
147:013 For he has strengthened the bars of your gates.
        He has blessed your children within you.
147:014 He makes peace in your borders.  He fills you with the finest
        of the wheat.
147:015 He sends out his commandment to the earth.  His word
        runs very swiftly.
147:016 He gives snow like wool, and scatters frost like ashes.
147:017 He hurls down his hail like pebbles.  Who can stand before his cold?
147:018 He sends out his word, and melts them.  He causes his wind
        to blow, and the waters flow.
147:019 He shows his word to Jacob; his statutes and his ordinances
        to Israel.
147:020 He has not done this for just any nation.  They don't know
        his ordinances.  Praise Yah!
148:001 Praise Yah!  Praise Yahweh from the heavens!  Praise him
        in the heights!
148:002 Praise him, all his angels!  Praise him, all his army!
148:003 Praise him, sun and moon!  Praise him, all you shining stars!
148:004 Praise him, you heavens of heavens, You waters that are
        above the heavens.
148:005 Let them praise the name of Yahweh, For he commanded,
        and they were created.
148:006 He has also established them forever and ever.  He has made
        a decree which will not pass away.
148:007 Praise Yahweh from the earth, you great sea creatures,
        and all depths!
148:008 Lightning and hail, snow and clouds; stormy wind,
        fulfilling his word;
148:009 mountains and all hills; fruit trees and all cedars;
148:010 wild animals and all livestock; small creatures and flying birds;
148:011 kings of the earth and all peoples; princes and all judges
        of the earth;
148:012 both young men and maidens; old men and children:
148:013 let them praise the name of Yahweh, for his name alone is exalted.
        His glory is above the earth and the heavens.
148:014 He has lifted up the horn of his people, the praise of all
        his saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near
        to him.  Praise Yah!
149:001 Praise Yahweh!  Sing to Yahweh a new song, his praise in
        the assembly of the saints.
149:002 Let Israel rejoice in him who made them.  Let the children
        of Zion be joyful in their King.
149:003 Let them praise his name in the dance!  Let them sing praises
        to him with tambourine and harp!
149:004 For Yahweh takes pleasure in his people.  He crowns
        the humble with salvation.
149:005 Let the saints rejoice in honor.  Let them sing for joy
        on their beds.
149:006 May the high praises of God be in their mouths, and a two-edged
        sword in their hand;
149:007 To execute vengeance on the nations, and punishments on the peoples;
149:008 To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with
        fetters of iron;
149:009 to execute on them the written judgment.  All his saints
        have this honor.  Praise Yah!
150:001 Praise Yah!  Praise God in his sanctuary!  Praise him in his
        heavens for his acts of power!
150:002 Praise him for his mighty acts!  Praise him according to
        his excellent greatness!
150:003 Praise him with the sounding of the trumpet!  Praise him
        with harp and lyre!
150:004 Praise him with tambourine and dancing!  Praise him with stringed
        instruments and flute!
150:005 Praise him with loud cymbals!  Praise him with resounding cymbals!
150:006 Let everything that has breath praise Yah!  Praise Yah!

Book 20 Proverbs
001:001 The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel:
001:002 to know wisdom and instruction; to discern the words of understanding;
001:003 to receive instruction in wise dealing, in righteousness,
        justice, and equity;
001:004 to give prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion
        to the young man:
001:005 that the wise man may hear, and increase in learning;
        that the man of understanding may attain to sound counsel:
001:006 to understand a proverb, and parables, the words and riddles
        of the wise.
001:007 The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge; but the foolish
        despise wisdom and instruction.
001:008 My son, listen to your father's instruction, and don't forsake
        your mother's teaching:
001:009 for they will be a garland to grace your head, and chains
        around your neck.
001:010 My son, if sinners entice you, don't consent.
001:011 If they say, "Come with us, Let's lay in wait for blood;
        let's lurk secretly for the innocent without cause;
001:012 let's swallow them up alive like Sheol, and whole, like those
        who go down into the pit.
001:013 We'll find all valuable wealth.  We'll fill our houses with spoil.
001:014 You shall cast your lot among us.  We'll all have one purse."
001:015 My son, don't walk in the way with them.  Keep your foot
        from their path,
001:016 for their feet run to evil.  They hurry to shed blood.
001:017 For in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird:
001:018 but these lay wait for their own blood.  They lurk secretly
        for their own lives.
001:019 So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain.
        It takes away the life of its owners.
001:020 Wisdom calls aloud in the street.  She utters her voice
        in the public squares.
001:021 She calls at the head of noisy places.  At the entrance
        of the city gates, she utters her words:
001:022 "How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity?
        How long will mockers delight themselves in mockery,
        and fools hate knowledge?
001:023 Turn at my reproof.  Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you.
        I will make known my words to you.
001:024 Because I have called, and you have refused; I have stretched
        out my hand, and no one has paid attention;
001:025 but you have ignored all my counsel, and wanted none of my reproof;
001:026 I also will laugh at your disaster.  I will mock when
        calamity overtakes you;
001:027 when calamity overtakes you like a storm, when your disaster comes
        on like a whirlwind; when distress and anguish come on you.
001:028 Then will they call on me, but I will not answer.
        They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me;
001:029 because they hated knowledge, and didn't choose the fear of Yahweh.
001:030 They wanted none of my counsel.  They despised all my reproof.
001:031 Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way,
        and be filled with their own schemes.
001:032 For the backsliding of the simple will kill them.
        The careless ease of fools will destroy them.
001:033 But whoever listens to me will dwell securely, and will be at ease,
        without fear of harm."
002:001 My son, if you will receive my words, and store up my
        commandments within you;
002:002 So as to turn your ear to wisdom, and apply your
        heart to understanding;
002:003 Yes, if you call out for discernment, and lift up your
        voice for understanding;
002:004 If you seek her as silver, and search for her as
        for hidden treasures:
002:005 then you will understand the fear of Yahweh, and find
        the knowledge of God.
002:006 For Yahweh gives wisdom.  Out of his mouth comes
        knowledge and understanding.
002:007 He lays up sound wisdom for the upright.  He is a shield
        to those who walk in integrity;
002:008 that he may guard the paths of justice, and preserve the way
        of his saints.
002:009 Then you will understand righteousness and justice, equity and
        every good path.
002:010 For wisdom will enter into your heart.  Knowledge will be
        pleasant to your soul.
002:011 Discretion will watch over you.  Understanding will keep you,
002:012 to deliver you from the way of evil, from the men who
        speak perverse things;
002:013 who forsake the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;
002:014 who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the perverseness of evil;
002:015 who are crooked in their ways, and wayward in their paths:
002:016 To deliver you from the strange woman, even from the foreigner
        who flatters with her words;
002:017 who forsakes the friend of her youth, and forgets the covenant
        of her God:
002:018 for her house leads down to death, her paths to the dead.
002:019 None who go to her return again, neither do they attain
        to the paths of life:
002:020 that you may walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths
        of the righteous.
002:021 For the upright will dwell in the land.  The perfect will
        remain in it.
002:022 But the wicked will be cut off from the land.  The treacherous
        will be rooted out of it.
003:001 My son, don't forget my teaching; but let your heart
        keep my commandments:
003:002 for length of days, and years of life, and peace, will they
        add to you.
003:003 Don't let kindness and truth forsake you.  Bind them around
        your neck.  Write them on the tablet of your heart.
003:004 So you will find favor, and good understanding in the sight
        of God and man.
003:005 Trust in Yahweh with all your heart, and don't lean on
        your own understanding.
003:006 In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make
        your paths straight.
003:007 Don't be wise in your own eyes.  Fear Yahweh, and depart from evil.
003:008 It will be health to your body, and nourishment to your bones.
003:009 Honor Yahweh with your substance, with the first fruits
        of all your increase:
003:010 so your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will
        overflow with new wine.
003:011 My son, don't despise Yahweh's discipline, neither be weary
        of his reproof:
003:012 for whom Yahweh loves, he reproves; even as a father reproves
        the son in whom he delights.
003:013 Happy is the man who finds wisdom, the man who gets understanding.
003:014 For her good profit is better than getting silver, and her
        return is better than fine gold.
003:015 She is more precious than rubies.  None of the things you can
        desire are to be compared to her.
003:016 Length of days is in her right hand.  In her left hand are
        riches and honor.
003:017 Her ways are ways of pleasantness.  All her paths are peace.
003:018 She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her.
        Happy is everyone who retains her.
003:019 By wisdom Yahweh founded the earth.  By understanding,
        he established the heavens.
003:020 By his knowledge, the depths were broken up, and the skies
        drop down the dew.
003:021 My son, let them not depart from your eyes.  Keep sound
        wisdom and discretion:
003:022 so they will be life to your soul, and grace for your neck.
003:023 Then you shall walk in your way securely.  Your foot won't stumble.
003:024 When you lie down, you will not be afraid.  Yes, you will lie down,
        and your sleep will be sweet.
003:025 Don't be afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation
        of the wicked, when it comes:
003:026 for Yahweh will be your confidence, and will keep your foot
        from being taken.
003:027 Don't withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it
        is in the power of your hand to do it.
003:028 Don't say to your neighbor, "Go, and come again; tomorrow I
        will give it to you," when you have it by you.
003:029 Don't devise evil against your neighbor, seeing he dwells
        securely by you.
003:030 Don't strive with a man without cause, if he has done you no harm.
003:031 Don't envy the man of violence.  Choose none of his ways.
003:032 For the perverse is an abomination to Yahweh, but his friendship
        is with the upright.
003:033 Yahweh's curse is in the house of the wicked, but he blesses
        the habitation of the righteous.
003:034 Surely he mocks the mockers, but he gives grace to the humble.
003:035 The wise will inherit glory, but shame will be the promotion
        of fools.
004:001 Listen, sons, to a father's instruction.  Pay attention
        and know understanding;
004:002 for I give you sound learning.  Don't forsake my law.
004:003 For I was a son to my father, tender and an only child
        in the sight of my mother.
004:004 He taught me, and said to me:  "Let your heart retain my words.
        Keep my commandments, and live.
004:005 Get wisdom.  Get understanding.  Don't forget, neither swerve
        from the words of my mouth.
004:006 Don't forsake her, and she will preserve you.  Love her,
        and she will keep you.
004:007 Wisdom is supreme.  Get wisdom.  Yes, though it costs all
        your possessions, get understanding.
004:008 Esteem her, and she will exalt you.  She will bring you to honor,
        when you embrace her.
004:009 She will give to your head a garland of grace.  She will deliver
        a crown of splendor to you."
004:010 Listen, my son, and receive my sayings.  The years of your life
        will be many.
004:011 I have taught you in the way of wisdom.  I have led you
        in straight paths.
004:012 When you go, your steps will not be hampered.  When you run,
        you will not stumble.
004:013 Take firm hold of instruction.  Don't let her go.
        Keep her, for she is your life.
004:014 Don't enter into the path of the wicked.  Don't walk in the way
        of evil men.
004:015 Avoid it, and don't pass by it.  Turn from it, and pass on.
004:016 For they don't sleep, unless they do evil.  Their sleep is
        taken away, unless they make someone fall.
004:017 For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.
004:018 But the path of the righteous is like the dawning light,
        that shines more and more until the perfect day.
004:019 The way of the wicked is like darkness.  They don't know
        what they stumble over.
004:020 My son, attend to my words.  Turn your ear to my sayings.
004:021 Let them not depart from your eyes.  Keep them in the midst
        of your heart.
004:022 For they are life to those who find them, and health to
        their whole body.
004:023 Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it is the
        wellspring of life.
004:024 Put away from yourself a perverse mouth.  Put corrupt lips
        far from you.
004:025 Let your eyes look straight ahead.  Fix your gaze
        directly before you.
004:026 Make the path of your feet level.  Let all of your
        ways be established.
004:027 Don't turn to the right hand nor to the left.  Remove your
        foot from evil.
005:001 My son, pay attention to my wisdom.  Turn your ear
        to my understanding:
005:002 that you may maintain discretion, that your lips
        may preserve knowledge.
005:003 For the lips of an adulteress drip honey.  Her mouth is
        smoother than oil,
005:004 But in the end she is as bitter as wormwood, and as sharp
        as a two-edged sword.
005:005 Her feet go down to death.  Her steps lead straight to Sheol.
005:006 She gives no thought to the way of life.  Her ways are crooked,
        and she doesn't know it.
005:007 Now therefore, my sons, listen to me.  Don't depart from
        the words of my mouth.
005:008 Remove your way far from her.  Don't come near the door
        of her house,
005:009 lest you give your honor to others, and your years to the cruel one;
005:010 lest strangers feast on your wealth, and your labors enrich
        another man's house.
005:011 You will groan at your latter end, when your flesh and your
        body are consumed,
005:012 and say, "How I have hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;
005:013 neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor turned
        my ear to those who instructed me!
005:014 I have come to the brink of utter ruin, in the midst of
        the gathered assembly."
005:015 Drink water out of your own cistern, running water out of
        your own well.
005:016 Should your springs overflow in the streets, streams of water
        in the public squares?
005:017 Let them be for yourself alone, not for strangers with you.
005:018 Let your spring be blessed.  Rejoice in the wife of your youth.
005:019 A loving doe and a graceful deer--let her breasts satisfy you
        at all times.  Be captivated always with her love.
005:020 For why should you, my son, be captivated with an adulteress?
        Why embrace the bosom of another?
005:021 For the ways of man are before the eyes of Yahweh.
        He examines all his paths.
005:022 The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare him.  The cords of his sin
        hold him firmly.
005:023 He will die for lack of instruction.  In the greatness of his folly,
        he will go astray.
006:001 My son, if you have become collateral for your neighbor,
        if you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger;
006:002 You are trapped by the words of your mouth.  You are ensnared
        with the words of your mouth.
006:003 Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself, seeing you have
        come into the hand of your neighbor.  Go, humble yourself.
        Press your plea with your neighbor.
006:004 Give no sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to your eyelids.
006:005 Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter,
        like a bird from the snare of the fowler.
006:006 Go to the ant, you sluggard.  Consider her ways, and be wise;
006:007 which having no chief, overseer, or ruler,
006:008 provides her bread in the summer, and gathers her food
        in the harvest.
006:009 How long will you sleep, sluggard?  When will you arise out
        of your sleep?
006:010 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the
        hands to sleep:
006:011 so your poverty will come as a robber, and your scarcity
        as an armed man.
006:012 A worthless person, a man of iniquity, is he who walks with
        a perverse mouth;
006:013 who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet, who motions
        with his fingers;
006:014 in whose heart is perverseness, who devises evil continually,
        who always sows discord.
006:015 Therefore his calamity will come suddenly.  He will be
        broken suddenly, and that without remedy.
006:016 There are six things which Yahweh hates; yes, seven which are
        an abomination to him:
006:017 haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood;
006:018 a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are swift
        in running to mischief,
006:019 a false witness who utters lies, and he who sows
        discord among brothers.
006:020 My son, keep your father's commandment, and don't forsake
        your mother's teaching.
006:021 Bind them continually on your heart.  Tie them around your neck.
006:022 When you walk, it will lead you.  When you sleep, it will watch
        over you.  When you awake, it will talk with you.
006:023 For the commandment is a lamp, and the law is light.
        Reproofs of instruction are the way of life,
006:024 to keep you from the immoral woman, from the flattery of
        the wayward wife's tongue.
006:025 Don't lust after her beauty in your heart, neither let her
        captivate you with her eyelids.
006:026 For a prostitute reduces you to a piece of bread.
        The adulteress hunts for your precious life.
006:027 Can a man scoop fire into his lap, and his clothes not be burned?
006:028 Or can one walk on hot coals, and his feet not be scorched?
006:029 So is he who goes in to his neighbor's wife.  Whoever touches
        her will not be unpunished.
006:030 Men don't despise a thief, if he steals to satisfy himself
        when he is hungry:
006:031 but if he is found, he shall restore seven times.
        He shall give all the wealth of his house.
006:032 He who commits adultery with a woman is void of understanding.
        He who does it destroys his own soul.
006:033 He will get wounds and dishonor.  His reproach will not
        be wiped away.
006:034 For jealousy arouses the fury of the husband.  He won't spare
        in the day of vengeance.
006:035 He won't regard any ransom, neither will he rest content,
        though you give many gifts.
007:001 My son, keep my words.  Lay up my commandments within you.
007:002 Keep my commandments and live!  Guard my teaching as the apple
        of your eye.
007:003 Bind them on your fingers.  Write them on the tablet of your heart.
007:004 Tell wisdom, "You are my sister."  Call understanding your relative,
007:005 that they may keep you from the strange woman, from the foreigner
        who flatters with her words.
007:006 For at the window of my house, I looked out through my lattice.
007:007 I saw among the simple ones.  I discerned among the youths
        a young man void of understanding,
007:008 passing through the street near her corner, he went the way
        to her house,
007:009 in the twilight, in the evening of the day, in the middle
        of the night and in the darkness.
007:010 Behold, there a woman met him with the attire of a prostitute,
        and with crafty intent.
007:011 She is loud and defiant.  Her feet don't stay in her house.
007:012 Now she is in the streets, now in the squares, and lurking
        at every corner.
007:013 So she caught him, and kissed him.  With an impudent face she
        said to him:
007:014 "Sacrifices of peace offerings are with me.  This day I have
        paid my vows.
007:015 Therefore I came out to meet you, to diligently seek your face,
        and I have found you.
007:016 I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry, with striped
        cloths of the yarn of Egypt.
007:017 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
007:018 Come, let's take our fill of loving until the morning.
        Let's solace ourselves with loving.
007:019 For my husband isn't at home.  He has gone on a long journey.
007:020 He has taken a bag of money with him.  He will come home
        at the full moon."
007:021 With persuasive words, she led him astray.  With the flattering
        of her lips, she seduced him.
007:022 He followed her immediately, as an ox goes to the slaughter,
        as a fool stepping into a noose.
007:023 Until an arrow strikes through his liver, as a bird hurries
        to the snare, and doesn't know that it will cost his life.
007:024 Now therefore, sons, listen to me.  Pay attention to the words
        of my mouth.
007:025 Don't let your heart turn to her ways.  Don't go astray
        in her paths,
007:026 for she has thrown down many wounded.  Yes, all her slain
        are a mighty army.
007:027 Her house is the way to Sheol, going down to the chambers of death.
008:001 Doesn't wisdom cry out?  Doesn't understanding raise her voice?
008:002 On the top of high places by the way, where the paths meet,
        she stands.
008:003 Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, at the entry doors,
        she cries aloud:
008:004 "To you men, I call!  I send my voice to the sons of mankind.
008:005 You simple, understand prudence.  You fools, be of
        an understanding heart.
008:006 Hear, for I will speak excellent things.  The opening of my
        lips is for right things.
008:007 For my mouth speaks truth.  Wickedness is an abomination
        to my lips.
008:008 All the words of my mouth are in righteousness.
        There is nothing crooked or perverse in them.
008:009 They are all plain to him who understands, right to those
        who find knowledge.
008:010 Receive my instruction rather than silver; knowledge rather
        than choice gold.
008:011 For wisdom is better than rubies.  All the things that may be
        desired can't be compared to it.
008:012 "I, wisdom, have made prudence my dwelling.  Find out
        knowledge and discretion.
008:013 The fear of Yahweh is to hate evil.  I hate pride, arrogance,
        the evil way, and the perverse mouth.
008:014 Counsel and sound knowledge are mine.  I have understanding
        and power.
008:015 By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.
008:016 By me princes rule; nobles, and all the righteous rulers
        of the earth.
008:017 I love those who love me.  Those who seek me diligently
        will find me.
008:018 With me are riches, honor, enduring wealth, and prosperity.
008:019 My fruit is better than gold, yes, than fine gold; my yield
        than choice silver.
008:020 I walk in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the
        paths of justice;
008:021 That I may give wealth to those who love me.
        I fill their treasuries.
008:022 "Yahweh possessed me in the beginning of his work, before his
        deeds of old.
008:023 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning,
        before the earth existed.
008:024 When there were no depths, I was brought forth, when there
        were no springs abounding with water.
008:025 Before the mountains were settled in place, before the hills,
        I was brought forth;
008:026 while as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields,
        nor the beginning of the dust of the world.
008:027 When he established the heavens, I was there; when he set
        a circle on the surface of the deep,
008:028 when he established the clouds above, when the springs
        of the deep became strong,
008:029 when he gave to the sea its boundary, that the waters should not
        violate his commandment, when he marked out the foundations
        of the earth;
008:030 then I was the craftsman by his side.  I was a delight day by day,
        always rejoicing before him,
008:031 Rejoicing in his whole world.  My delight was with the sons of men.
008:032 "Now therefore, my sons, listen to me, for blessed are those
        who keep my ways.
008:033 Hear instruction, and be wise.  Don't refuse it.
008:034 Blessed is the man who hears me, watching daily at my gates,
        waiting at my door posts.
008:035 For whoever finds me, finds life, and will obtain favor from Yahweh.
008:036 But he who sins against me wrongs his own soul.
        All those who hate me love death."
009:001 Wisdom has built her house.  She has carved out her seven pillars.
009:002 She has prepared her meat.  She has mixed her wine.
        She has also set her table.
009:003 She has sent out her maidens.  She cries from the highest
        places of the city:
009:004 "Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!"  As for him who is
        void of understanding, she says to him,
009:005 "Come, eat some of my bread, Drink some of the wine which
        I have mixed!
009:006 Leave your simple ways, and live.  Walk in the way of understanding."
009:007 He who corrects a mocker invites insult.  He who reproves
        a wicked man invites abuse.
009:008 Don't reprove a scoffer, lest he hate you.  Reprove a wise man,
        and he will love you.
009:009 Instruct a wise man, and he will be still wiser.
        Teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.
009:010 The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom.  The knowledge
        of the Holy One is understanding.
009:011 For by me your days will be multiplied.  The years of your life
        will be increased.
009:012 If you are wise, you are wise for yourself.  If you mock,
        you alone will bear it.
009:013 The foolish woman is loud, Undisciplined, and knows nothing.
009:014 She sits at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places
        of the city,
009:015 To call to those who pass by, who go straight on their ways,
009:016 "Whoever is simple, let him turn in here."  as for him who is
        void of understanding, she says to him,
009:017 "Stolen water is sweet.  Food eaten in secret is pleasant."
009:018 But he doesn't know that the dead are there, that her guests
        are in the depths of Sheol.
010:001 The proverbs of Solomon.  A wise son makes a glad father;
        but a foolish son brings grief to his mother.
010:002 Treasures of wickedness profit nothing, but righteousness
        delivers from death.
010:003 Yahweh will not allow the soul of the righteous to go hungry,
        but he thrusts away the desire of the wicked.
010:004 He becomes poor who works with a lazy hand, but the hand
        of the diligent brings wealth.
010:005 He who gathers in summer is a wise son, but he who sleeps
        during the harvest is a son who causes shame.
010:006 Blessings are on the head of the righteous, but violence covers
        the mouth of the wicked.
010:007 The memory of the righteous is blessed, but the name of
        the wicked will rot.
010:008 The wise in heart accept commandments, but a chattering
        fool will fall.
010:009 He who walks blamelessly walks surely, but he who perverts
        his ways will be found out.
010:010 One winking with the eye causes sorrow, but a chattering
        fool will fall.
010:011 The mouth of the righteous is a spring of life, but violence
        covers the mouth of the wicked.
010:012 Hatred stirs up strife, but love covers all wrongs.
010:013 Wisdom is found on the lips of him who has discernment,
        but a rod is for the back of him who is void of understanding.
010:014 Wise men lay up knowledge, but the mouth of the foolish
        is near ruin.
010:015 The rich man's wealth is his strong city.  The destruction
        of the poor is their poverty.
010:016 The labor of the righteous leads to life.  The increase
        of the wicked leads to sin.
010:017 He is in the way of life who heeds correction, but he who forsakes
        reproof leads others astray.
010:018 He who hides hatred has lying lips.  He who utters a slander
        is a fool.
010:019 In the multitude of words there is no lack of disobedience,
        but he who restrains his lips does wisely.
010:020 The tongue of the righteous is like choice silver.
        The heart of the wicked is of little worth.
010:021 The lips of the righteous feed many, but the foolish die
        for lack of understanding.
010:022 Yahweh's blessing brings wealth, and he adds no trouble to it.
010:023 It is a fool's pleasure to do wickedness, but wisdom is a man
        of understanding's pleasure.
010:024 What the wicked fear, will overtake them, but the desire
        of the righteous will be granted.
010:025 When the whirlwind passes, the wicked is no more;
        but the righteous stand firm forever.
010:026 As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is
        the sluggard to those who send him.
010:027 The fear of Yahweh prolongs days, but the years of the wicked
        shall be shortened.
010:028 The prospect of the righteous is joy, but the hope of the
        wicked will perish.
010:029 The way of Yahweh is a stronghold to the upright, but it
        is a destruction to the workers of iniquity.
010:030 The righteous will never be removed, but the wicked will not
        dwell in the land.
010:031 The mouth of the righteous brings forth wisdom, but the perverse
        tongue will be cut off.
010:032 The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable, but the mouth
        of the wicked is perverse.
011:001 A false balance is an abomination to Yahweh, but accurate
        weights are his delight.
011:002 When pride comes, then comes shame, but with humility comes wisdom.
011:003 The integrity of the upright shall guide them, but the perverseness
        of the treacherous shall destroy them.
011:004 Riches don't profit in the day of wrath, but righteousness
        delivers from death.
011:005 The righteousness of the blameless will direct his way,
        but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.
011:006 The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them,
        but the unfaithful will be trapped by evil desires.
011:007 When a wicked man dies, hope perishes, and expectation of power
        comes to nothing.
011:008 A righteous person is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked
        takes his place.
011:009 With his mouth the godless man destroys his neighbor,
        but the righteous will be delivered through knowledge.
011:010 When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices.
        When the wicked perish, there is shouting.
011:011 By the blessing of the upright, the city is exalted, but it
        is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.
011:012 One who despises his neighbor is void of wisdom, but a man
        of understanding holds his peace.
011:013 One who brings gossip betrays a confidence, but one who is
        of a trustworthy spirit is one who keeps a secret.
011:014 Where there is no wise guidance, the nation falls, but in
        the multitude of counselors there is victory.
011:015 He who is collateral for a stranger will suffer for it,
        but he who refuses pledges of collateral is secure.
011:016 A gracious woman obtains honor, but violent men obtain riches.
011:017 The merciful man does good to his own soul, but he who is cruel
        troubles his own flesh.
011:018 Wicked people earn deceitful wages, but one who sows righteousness
        reaps a sure reward.
011:019 He who is truly righteous gets life.  He who pursues
        evil gets death.
011:020 Those who are perverse in heart are an abomination to Yahweh,
        but those whose ways are blameless are his delight.
011:021 Most certainly, the evil man will not be unpunished,
        but the seed of the righteous will be delivered.
011:022 Like a gold ring in a pig's snout, is a beautiful woman
        who lacks discretion.
011:023 The desire of the righteous is only good.  The expectation
        of the wicked is wrath.
011:024 There is one who scatters, and increases yet more.
        There is one who withholds more than is appropriate,
        but gains poverty.
011:025 The liberal soul shall be made fat.  He who waters shall
        be watered also himself.
011:026 People curse someone who withholds grain, but blessing will
        be on the head of him who sells it.
011:027 He who diligently seeks good seeks favor, but he who searches
        after evil, it shall come to him.
011:028 He who trusts in his riches will fall, but the righteous shall
        flourish as the green leaf.
011:029 He who troubles his own house shall inherit the wind.
        The foolish shall be servant to the wise of heart.
011:030 The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life.  He who is
        wise wins souls.
011:031 Behold, the righteous shall be repaid in the earth; how much
        more the wicked and the sinner!
012:001 Whoever loves correction loves knowledge, but he who hates
        reproof is stupid.
012:002 A good man shall obtain favor from Yahweh, but he will condemn
        a man of wicked devices.
012:003 A man shall not be established by wickedness, but the root
        of the righteous shall not be moved.
012:004 A worthy woman is the crown of her husband, but a disgraceful
        wife is as rottenness in his bones.
012:005 The thoughts of the righteous are just, but the advice
        of the wicked is deceitful.
012:006 The words of the wicked are about lying in wait for blood,
        but the speech of the upright rescues them.
012:007 The wicked are overthrown, and are no more, but the house
        of the righteous shall stand.
012:008 A man shall be commended according to his wisdom, but he who has
        a warped mind shall be despised.
012:009 Better is he who is lightly esteemed, and has a servant,
        than he who honors himself, and lacks bread.
012:010 A righteous man regards the life of his animal, but the tender
        mercies of the wicked are cruel.
012:011 He who tills his land shall have plenty of bread, but he who
        chases fantasies is void of understanding.
012:012 The wicked desires the plunder of evil men, but the root
        of the righteous flourishes.
012:013 An evil man is trapped by sinfulness of lips, but the righteous
        shall come out of trouble.
012:014 A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth.
        The work of a man's hands shall be rewarded to him.
012:015 The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but he who is wise
        listens to counsel.
012:016 A fool shows his annoyance the same day, but one who overlooks
        an insult is prudent.
012:017 He who is truthful testifies honestly, but a false witness lies.
012:018 There is one who speaks rashly like the piercing of a sword,
        but the tongue of the wise heals.
012:019 Truth's lips will be established forever, but a lying tongue
        is only momentary.
012:020 Deceit is in the heart of those who plot evil, but joy comes
        to the promoters of peace.
012:021 No mischief shall happen to the righteous, but the wicked
        shall be filled with evil.
012:022 Lying lips are an abomination to Yahweh, but those who do
        the truth are his delight.
012:023 A prudent man keeps his knowledge, but the hearts of
        fools proclaim foolishness.
012:024 The hands of the diligent ones shall rule, but laziness ends
        in slave labor.
012:025 Anxiety in a man's heart weighs it down, but a kind word
        makes it glad.
012:026 A righteous person is cautious in friendship, but the way
        of the wicked leads them astray.
012:027 The slothful man doesn't roast his game, but the possessions
        of diligent men are prized.
012:028 In the way of righteousness is life; in its path there
        is no death.
013:001 A wise son listens to his father's instruction, but a scoffer
        doesn't listen to rebuke.
013:002 By the fruit of his lips, a man enjoys good things;
        but the unfaithful crave violence.
013:003 He who guards his mouth guards his soul.  One who opens wide
        his lips comes to ruin.
013:004 The soul of the sluggard desires, and has nothing, but the desire
        of the diligent shall be fully satisfied.
013:005 A righteous man hates lies, but a wicked man brings
        shame and disgrace.
013:006 Righteousness guards the way of integrity, but wickedness
        overthrows the sinner.
013:007 There are some who pretend to be rich, yet have nothing.
        There are some who pretend to be poor, yet have great wealth.
013:008 The ransom of a man's life is his riches, but the poor
        hear no threats.
013:009 The light of the righteous shines brightly, but the lamp
        of the wicked is snuffed out.
013:010 Pride only breeds quarrels, but with ones who take advice is wisdom.
013:011 Wealth gained dishonestly dwindles away, but he who gathers
        by hand makes it grow.
013:012 Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but when longing is fulfilled,
        it is a tree of life.
013:013 Whoever despises instruction will pay for it, but he who respects
        a command will be rewarded.
013:014 The teaching of the wise is a spring of life, to turn from
        the snares of death.
013:015 Good understanding wins favor; but the way of the unfaithful is hard.
013:016 Every prudent man acts from knowledge, but a fool exposes folly.
013:017 A wicked messenger falls into trouble, but a trustworthy
        envoy gains healing.
013:018 Poverty and shame come to him who refuses discipline,
        but he who heeds correction shall be honored.
013:019 Longing fulfilled is sweet to the soul, but fools detest
        turning from evil.
013:020 One who walks with wise men grows wise, but a companion
        of fools suffers harm.
013:021 Misfortune pursues sinners, but prosperity rewards the righteous.
013:022 A good man leaves an inheritance to his children's children,
        but the wealth of the sinner is stored for the righteous.
013:023 An abundance of food is in poor people's fields, but injustice
        sweeps it away.
013:024 One who spares the rod hates his son, but one who loves him
        is careful to discipline him.
013:025 The righteous one eats to the satisfying of his soul,
        but the belly of the wicked goes hungry.
014:001 Every wise woman builds her house, but the foolish one tears
        it down with her own hands.
014:002 He who walks in his uprightness fears Yahweh, but he who is
        perverse in his ways despises him.
014:003 The fool's talk brings a rod to his back, but the lips
        of the wise protect them.
014:004 Where no oxen are, the crib is clean, but much increase is
        by the strength of the ox.
014:005 A truthful witness will not lie, but a false witness
        pours out lies.
014:006 A scoffer seeks wisdom, and doesn't find it, but knowledge
        comes easily to a discerning person.
014:007 Stay away from a foolish man, for you won't find knowledge
        on his lips.
014:008 The wisdom of the prudent is to think about his way,
        but the folly of fools is deceit.
014:009 Fools mock at making atonement for sins, but among the upright
        there is good will.
014:010 The heart knows its own bitterness and joy; he will not share
        these with a stranger.
014:011 The house of the wicked will be overthrown, but the tent
        of the upright will flourish.
014:012 There is a way which seems right to a man, but in the end it
        leads to death.
014:013 Even in laughter the heart may be sorrowful, and mirth may
        end in heaviness.
014:014 The unfaithful will be repaid for his own ways; likewise a good
        man will be rewarded for his ways.
014:015 A simple man believes everything, but the prudent man carefully
        considers his ways.
014:016 A wise man fears, and shuns evil, but the fool is
        hotheaded and reckless.
014:017 He who is quick to become angry will commit folly, and a crafty
        man is hated.
014:018 The simple inherit folly, but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.
014:019 The evil bow down before the good, and the wicked at the gates
        of the righteous.
014:020 The poor person is shunned even by his own neighbor,
        but the rich person has many friends.
014:021 He who despises his neighbor sins, but blessed is he who has
        pity on the poor.
014:022 Don't they go astray who plot evil?  But love and faithfulness
        belong to those who plan good.
014:023 In all hard work there is profit, but the talk of the lips
        leads only to poverty.
014:024 The crown of the wise is their riches, but the folly of fools
        crowns them with folly.
014:025 A truthful witness saves souls, but a false witness is deceitful.
014:026 In the fear of Yahweh is a secure fortress, and he will be
        a refuge for his children.
014:027 The fear of Yahweh is a fountain of life, turning people
        from the snares of death.
014:028 In the multitude of people is the king's glory, but in the lack
        of people is the destruction of the prince.
014:029 He who is slow to anger has great understanding, but he who has
        a quick temper displays folly.
014:030 The life of the body is a heart at peace, but envy rots the bones.
014:031 He who oppresses the poor shows contempt for his Maker,
        but he who is kind to the needy honors him.
014:032 The wicked is brought down in his calamity, but in death,
        the righteous has a refuge.
014:033 Wisdom rests in the heart of one who has understanding,
        and is even made known in the inward part of fools.
014:034 Righteousness exalts a nation, but sin is a disgrace to any people.
014:035 The king's favor is toward a servant who deals wisely,
        but his wrath is toward one who causes shame.
015:001 A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.
015:002 The tongue of the wise commends knowledge, but the mouth
        of fools gush out folly.
015:003 Yahweh's eyes are everywhere, keeping watch on the evil
        and the good.
015:004 A gentle tongue is a tree of life, but deceit in it
        crushes the spirit.
015:005 A fool despises his father's correction, but he who heeds
        reproof shows prudence.
015:006 In the house of the righteous is much treasure, but the income
        of the wicked brings trouble.
015:007 The lips of the wise spread knowledge; not so with the
        heart of fools.
015:008 The sacrifice made by the wicked is an abomination to Yahweh,
        but the prayer of the upright is his delight.
015:009 The way of the wicked is an abomination to Yahweh, but he loves
        him who follows after righteousness.
015:010 There is stern discipline for one who forsakes the way:
        whoever hates reproof shall die.
015:011 Sheol and Abaddon are before Yahweh--how much more then
        the hearts of the children of men!
015:012 A scoffer doesn't love to be reproved; he will not go to the wise.
015:013 A glad heart makes a cheerful face; but an aching heart
        breaks the spirit.
015:014 The heart of one who has understanding seeks knowledge,
        but the mouths of fools feed on folly.
015:015 All the days of the afflicted are wretched, but one who has
        a cheerful heart enjoys a continual feast.
015:016 Better is little, with the fear of Yahweh, than great
        treasure with trouble.
015:017 Better is a dinner of herbs, where love is, than a fattened
        calf with hatred.
015:018 A wrathful man stirs up contention, but one who is slow
        to anger appeases strife.
015:019 The way of the sluggard is like a thorn patch, but the path
        of the upright is a highway.
015:020 A wise son makes a father glad, but a foolish man
        despises his mother.
015:021 Folly is joy to one who is void of wisdom, but a man of
        understanding keeps his way straight.
015:022 Where there is no counsel, plans fail; but in a multitude
        of counselors they are established.
015:023 Joy comes to a man with the reply of his mouth.
        How good is a word at the right time!
015:024 The path of life leads upward for the wise, to keep him from
        going downward to Sheol.
015:025 Yahweh will uproot the house of the proud, but he will keep
        the widow's borders intact.
015:026 Yahweh detests the thoughts of the wicked, but the thoughts
        of the pure are pleasing.
015:027 He who is greedy for gain troubles his own house, but he who
        hates bribes will live.
015:028 The heart of the righteous weighs answers, but the mouth
        of the wicked gushes out evil.
015:029 Yahweh is far from the wicked, but he hears the prayer
        of the righteous.
015:030 The light of the eyes rejoices the heart.  Good news gives
        health to the bones.
015:031 The ear that listens to reproof lives, and will be at home
        among the wise.
015:032 He who refuses correction despises his own soul, but he who
        listens to reproof gets understanding.
015:033 The fear of Yahweh teaches wisdom.  Before honor is humility.
016:001 The plans of the heart belong to man, but the answer of the tongue
        is from Yahweh.
016:002 All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but Yahweh
        weighs the motives.
016:003 Commit your deeds to Yahweh, and your plans shall succeed.
016:004 Yahweh has made everything for its own end--yes, even the wicked
        for the day of evil.
016:005 Everyone who is proud in heart is an abomination to Yahweh:
        they shall certainly not be unpunished.
016:006 By mercy and truth iniquity is atoned for.  By the fear
        of Yahweh men depart from evil.
016:007 When a man's ways please Yahweh, he makes even his enemies
        to be at peace with him.
016:008 Better is a little with righteousness, than great
        revenues with injustice.
016:009 A man's heart plans his course, but Yahweh directs his steps.
016:010 Inspired judgments are on the lips of the king.
        He shall not betray his mouth.
016:011 Honest balances and scales are Yahweh's; all the weights
        in the bag are his work.
016:012 It is an abomination for kings to do wrong, for the throne
        is established by righteousness.
016:013 Righteous lips are the delight of kings.  They value one who
        speaks the truth.
016:014 The king's wrath is a messenger of death, but a wise man
        will pacify it.
016:015 In the light of the king's face is life.  His favor is like
        a cloud of the spring rain.
016:016 How much better it is to get wisdom than gold!  Yes, to get
        understanding is to be chosen rather than silver.
016:017 The highway of the upright is to depart from evil.
        He who keeps his way preserves his soul.
016:018 Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.
016:019 It is better to be of a lowly spirit with the poor, than to
        divide the plunder with the proud.
016:020 He who heeds the Word finds prosperity.  Whoever trusts
        in Yahweh is blessed.
016:021 The wise in heart shall be called prudent.  Pleasantness of
        the lips promotes instruction.
016:022 Understanding is a fountain of life to one who has it,
        but the punishment of fools is their folly.
016:023 The heart of the wise instructs his mouth, and adds learning
        to his lips.
016:024 Pleasant words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health
        to the bones.
016:025 There is a way which seems right to a man, but in the end it
        leads to death.
016:026 The appetite of the laboring man labors for him; for his mouth
        urges him on.
016:027 A worthless man devises mischief.  His speech is like
        a scorching fire.
016:028 A perverse man stirs up strife.  A whisperer separates close friends.
016:029 A man of violence entices his neighbor, and leads him in a way
        that is not good.
016:030 One who winks his eyes to plot perversities, one who compresses
        his lips, is bent on evil.
016:031 Gray hair is a crown of glory.  It is attained by a
        life of righteousness.
016:032 One who is slow to anger is better than the mighty;
        one who rules his spirit, than he who takes a city.
016:033 The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision
        is from Yahweh.
017:001 Better is a dry morsel with quietness, than a house full
        of feasting with strife.
017:002 A servant who deals wisely will rule over a son who causes shame,
        and shall have a part in the inheritance among the brothers.
017:003 The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold,
        but Yahweh tests the hearts.
017:004 An evil-doer heeds wicked lips.  A liar gives ear to
        a mischievous tongue.
017:005 Whoever mocks the poor reproaches his Maker.  He who is glad
        at calamity shall not be unpunished.
017:006 Children's children are the crown of old men; the glory
        of children are their parents.
017:007 Arrogant speech isn't fitting for a fool, much less do lying
        lips fit a prince.
017:008 A bribe is a precious stone in the eyes of him who gives it;
        wherever he turns, he prospers.
017:009 He who covers an offense promotes love; but he who repeats
        a matter separates best friends.
017:010 A rebuke enters deeper into one who has understanding than
        a hundred lashes into a fool.
017:011 An evil man seeks only rebellion; therefore a cruel messenger
        shall be sent against him.
017:012 Let a bear robbed of her cubs meet a man, rather than a fool
        in his folly.
017:013 Whoever rewards evil for good, evil shall not depart
        from his house.
017:014 The beginning of strife is like breaching a dam, therefore stop
        contention before quarreling breaks out.
017:015 He who justifies the wicked, and he who condemns the righteous,
        both of them alike are an abomination to Yahweh.
017:016 Why is there money in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom,
        seeing he has no understanding?
017:017 A friend loves at all times; and a brother is born for adversity.
017:018 A man void of understanding strikes hands, and becomes collateral
        in the presence of his neighbor.
017:019 He who loves disobedience loves strife.  One who builds a high
        gate seeks destruction.
017:020 One who has a perverse heart doesn't find prosperity,
        and one who has a deceitful tongue falls into trouble.
017:021 He who becomes the father of a fool grieves.  The father
        of a fool has no joy.
017:022 A cheerful heart makes good medicine, but a crushed spirit
        dries up the bones.
017:023 A wicked man receives a bribe in secret, to pervert
        the ways of justice.
017:024 Wisdom is before the face of one who has understanding,
        but the eyes of a fool wander to the ends of the earth.
017:025 A foolish son brings grief to his father, and bitterness
        to her who bore him.
017:026 Also to punish the righteous is not good, nor to flog officials
        for their integrity.
017:027 He who spares his words has knowledge.  He who is even tempered
        is a man of understanding.
017:028 Even a fool, when he keeps silent, is counted wise.
        When he shuts his lips, he is thought to be discerning.
018:001 An unfriendly man pursues selfishness, and defies all sound judgment.
018:002 A fool has no delight in understanding, but only in revealing
        his own opinion.
018:003 When wickedness comes, contempt also comes, and with
        shame comes disgrace.
018:004 The words of a man's mouth are like deep waters.
        The fountain of wisdom is like a flowing brook.
018:005 To be partial to the faces of the wicked is not good,
        nor to deprive the innocent of justice.
018:006 A fool's lips come into strife, and his mouth invites beatings.
018:007 A fool's mouth is his destruction, and his lips are a snare
        to his soul.
018:008 The words of a gossip are like dainty morsels:  they go down
        into a person's innermost parts.
018:009 One who is slack in his work is brother to him who is a
        master of destruction.
018:010 The name of Yahweh is a strong tower:  the righteous run to him,
        and are safe.
018:011 The rich man's wealth is his strong city, like an unscalable
        wall in his own imagination.
018:012 Before destruction the heart of man is proud, but before
        honor is humility.
018:013 He who gives answer before he hears, that is folly and
        shame to him.
018:014 A man's spirit will sustain him in sickness, but a crushed spirit,
        who can bear?
018:015 The heart of the discerning gets knowledge.  The ear of
        the wise seeks knowledge.
018:016 A man's gift makes room for him, and brings him before great men.
018:017 He who pleads his cause first seems right; until another comes
        and questions him.
018:018 The lot settles disputes, and keeps strong ones apart.
018:019 A brother offended is more difficult than a fortified city;
        and disputes are like the bars of a castle.
018:020 A man's stomach is filled with the fruit of his mouth.
        With the harvest of his lips he is satisfied.
018:021 Death and life are in the power of the tongue; those who love
        it will eat its fruit.
018:022 Whoever finds a wife finds a good thing, and obtains
        favor of Yahweh.
018:023 The poor plead for mercy, but the rich answer harshly.
018:024 A man of many companions may be ruined, but there is a friend
        who sticks closer than a brother.
019:001 Better is the poor who walks in his integrity than he who is
        perverse in his lips and is a fool.
019:002 It isn't good to have zeal without knowledge; nor being hasty
        with one's feet and missing the way.
019:003 The foolishness of man subverts his way; his heart
        rages against Yahweh.
019:004 Wealth adds many friends, but the poor is separated from his friend.
019:005 A false witness shall not be unpunished.  He who pours out lies
        shall not go free.
019:006 Many will entreat the favor of a ruler, and everyone is a friend
        to a man who gives gifts.
019:007 All the relatives of the poor shun him:  how much more
        do his friends avoid him!  He pursues them with pleas,
        but they are gone.
019:008 He who gets wisdom loves his own soul.  He who keeps understanding
        shall find good.
019:009 A false witness shall not be unpunished.  He who utters
        lies shall perish.
019:010 Delicate living is not appropriate for a fool, much less
        for a servant to have rule over princes.
019:011 The discretion of a man makes him slow to anger.
        It is his glory to overlook an offense.
019:012 The king's wrath is like the roaring of a lion, but his favor
        is like dew on the grass.
019:013 A foolish son is the calamity of his father.  A wife's quarrels
        are a continual dripping.
019:014 House and riches are an inheritance from fathers, but a prudent
        wife is from Yahweh.
019:015 Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep.  The idle soul
        shall suffer hunger.
019:016 He who keeps the commandment keeps his soul, but he who is
        contemptuous in his ways shall die.
019:017 He who has pity on the poor lends to Yahweh; he will reward him.
019:018 Discipline your son, for there is hope; don't be a willing
        party to his death.
019:019 A hot-tempered man must pay the penalty, for if you rescue him,
        you must do it again.
019:020 Listen to counsel and receive instruction, that you may be wise
        in your latter end.
019:021 There are many plans in a man's heart, but Yahweh's
        counsel will prevail.
019:022 That which makes a man to be desired is his kindness.
        A poor man is better than a liar.
019:023 The fear of Yahweh leads to life, then contentment; he rests
        and will not be touched by trouble.
019:024 The sluggard buries his hand in the dish; he will not so much
        as bring it to his mouth again.
019:025 Flog a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence;
        rebuke one who has understanding, and he will gain knowledge.
019:026 He who robs his father and drives away his mother, is a son
        who causes shame and brings reproach.
019:027 If you stop listening to instruction, my son, you will stray
        from the words of knowledge.
019:028 A corrupt witness mocks justice, and the mouth of the wicked
        gulps down iniquity.
019:029 Penalties are prepared for scoffers, and beatings for the
        backs of fools.
020:001 Wine is a mocker, and beer is a brawler.  Whoever is led astray
        by them is not wise.
020:002 The terror of a king is like the roaring of a lion.
        He who provokes him to anger forfeits his own life.
020:003 It is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife; but every
        fool will be quarreling.
020:004 The sluggard will not plow by reason of the winter;
        therefore he shall beg in harvest, and have nothing.
020:005 Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man
        of understanding will draw it out.
020:006 Many men claim to be men of unfailing love, but who can find
        a faithful man?
020:007 A righteous man walks in integrity.  Blessed are his
        children after him.
020:008 A king who sits on the throne of judgment scatters away all
        evil with his eyes.
020:009 Who can say, "I have made my heart pure.  I am clean
        and without sin?"
020:010 Differing weights and differing measures, both of them alike
        are an abomination to Yahweh.
020:011 Even a child makes himself known by his doings, whether his
        work is pure, and whether it is right.
020:012 The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, Yahweh has made even
        both of them.
020:013 Don't love sleep, lest you come to poverty.  Open your eyes,
        and you shall be satisfied with bread.
020:014 "It's no good, it's no good," says the buyer; but when he is
        gone his way, then he boasts.
020:015 There is gold and abundance of rubies; but the lips of knowledge
        are a rare jewel.
020:016 Take the garment of one who puts up collateral for a stranger;
        and hold him in pledge for a wayward woman.
020:017 Fraudulent food is sweet to a man, but afterwards his mouth
        is filled with gravel.
020:018 Plans are established by advice; by wise guidance you wage war!
020:019 He who goes about as a tale-bearer reveals secrets;
        therefore don't keep company with him who opens wide his lips.
020:020 Whoever curses his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put
        out in blackness of darkness.
020:021 An inheritance quickly gained at the beginning, won't be blessed
        in the end.
020:022 Don't say, "I will pay back evil."  Wait for Yahweh,
        and he will save you.
020:023 Yahweh detests differing weights, and dishonest scales
        are not pleasing.
020:024 A man's steps are from Yahweh; how then can man understand his way?
020:025 It is a snare to a man to make a rash dedication, then later
        to consider his vows.
020:026 A wise king winnows out the wicked, and drives the threshing
        wheel over them.
020:027 The spirit of man is Yahweh's lamp, searching all
        his innermost parts.
020:028 Love and faithfulness keep the king safe.  His throne is
        sustained by love.
020:029 The glory of young men is their strength.  The splendor of old
        men is their gray hair.
020:030 Wounding blows cleanse away evil, and beatings purge
        the innermost parts.
021:001 The king's heart is in Yahweh's hand like the watercourses.
        He turns it wherever he desires.
021:002 Every way of a man is right in his own eyes, but Yahweh
        weighs the hearts.
021:003 To do righteousness and justice is more acceptable to
        Yahweh than sacrifice.
021:004 A high look, and a proud heart, the lamp of the wicked, is sin.
021:005 The plans of the diligent surely lead to profit; and everyone
        who is hasty surely rushes to poverty.
021:006 Getting treasures by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor
        for those who seek death.
021:007 The violence of the wicked will drive them away, because they
        refuse to do what is right.
021:008 The way of the guilty is devious, but the conduct of the
        innocent is upright.
021:009 It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop,
        than to share a house with a contentious woman.
021:010 The soul of the wicked desires evil; his neighbor finds no mercy
        in his eyes.
021:011 When the mocker is punished, the simple gains wisdom.
        When the wise is instructed, he receives knowledge.
021:012 The Righteous One considers the house of the wicked, and brings
        the wicked to ruin.
021:013 Whoever stops his ears at the cry of the poor, he will also cry out,
        but shall not be heard.
021:014 A gift in secret pacifies anger; and a bribe in the cloak,
        strong wrath.
021:015 It is joy to the righteous to do justice; but it is a destruction
        to the workers of iniquity.
021:016 The man who wanders out of the way of understanding shall rest
        in the assembly of the dead.
021:017 He who loves pleasure shall be a poor man.  He who loves wine
        and oil shall not be rich.
021:018 The wicked is a ransom for the righteous; the treacherous
        for the upright.
021:019 It is better to dwell in a desert land, than with a contentious
        and fretful woman.
021:020 There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise;
        but a foolish man swallows it up.
021:021 He who follows after righteousness and kindness finds life,
        righteousness, and honor.
021:022 A wise man scales the city of the mighty, and brings down
        the strength of its confidence.
021:023 Whoever guards his mouth and his tongue keeps his soul from troubles.
021:024 The proud and haughty man, "scoffer" is his name; he works
        in the arrogance of pride.
021:025 The desire of the sluggard kills him, for his hands refuse to labor.
021:026 There are those who covet greedily all day long; but the righteous
        give and don't withhold.
021:027 The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination:  how much more,
        when he brings it with a wicked mind!
021:028 A false witness will perish, and a man who listens
        speaks to eternity.
021:029 A wicked man hardens his face; but as for the upright,
        he establishes his ways.
021:030 There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against Yahweh.
021:031 The horse is prepared for the day of battle; but victory
        is with Yahweh.
022:001 A good name is more desirable than great riches, and loving
        favor is better than silver and gold.
022:002 The rich and the poor have this in common:  Yahweh is the maker
        of them all.
022:003 A prudent man sees danger, and hides himself; but the simple
        pass on, and suffer for it.
022:004 The result of humility and the fear of Yahweh is wealth,
        honor, and life.
022:005 Thorns and snares are in the path of the wicked:
        whoever guards his soul stays from them.
022:006 Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old
        he will not depart from it.
022:007 The rich rule over the poor.  The borrower is servant
        to the lender.
022:008 He who sows wickedness reaps trouble, and the rod of his fury
        will be destroyed.
022:009 He who has a generous eye will be blessed; for he shares his
        food with the poor.
022:010 Drive out the mocker, and strife will go out; yes, quarrels and
        insults will stop.
022:011 He who loves purity of heart and speaks gracefully is
        the king's friend.
022:012 The eyes of Yahweh watch over knowledge; but he frustrates
        the words of the unfaithful.
022:013 The sluggard says, "There is a lion outside!  I will be killed
        in the streets!"
022:014 The mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit:  he who is under
        Yahweh's wrath will fall into it.
022:015 Folly is bound up in the heart of a child:  the rod of discipline
        drives it far from him.
022:016 Whoever oppresses the poor for his own increase and whoever
        gives to the rich, both come to poverty.
022:017 Turn your ear, and listen to the words of the wise.
        Apply your heart to my teaching.
022:018 For it is a pleasant thing if you keep them within you,
        if all of them are ready on your lips.
022:019 That your trust may be in Yahweh, I teach you today, even you.
022:020 Haven't I written to you thirty excellent things of
        counsel and knowledge,
022:021 To teach you truth, reliable words, to give sound answers
        to the ones who sent you?
022:022 Don't exploit the poor, because he is poor; and don't crush
        the needy in court;
022:023 for Yahweh will plead their case, and plunder the life
        of those who plunder them.
022:024 Don't befriend a hot-tempered man, and don't associate with one
        who harbors anger:
022:025 lest you learn his ways, and ensnare your soul.
022:026 Don't you be one of those who strike hands, of those who are
        collateral for debts.
022:027 If you don't have means to pay, why should he take away your
        bed from under you?
022:028 Don't move the ancient boundary stone, which your fathers
        have set up.
022:029 Do you see a man skilled in his work?  He will serve kings.
        He won't serve obscure men.
023:001 When you sit to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what
        is before you;
023:002 put a knife to your throat, if you are a man given to appetite.
023:003 Don't be desirous of his dainties, seeing they are deceitful food.
023:004 Don't weary yourself to be rich.  In your wisdom, show restraint.
023:005 Why do you set your eyes on that which is not?  For it certainly
        sprouts wings like an eagle and flies in the sky.
023:006 Don't eat the food of him who has a stingy eye, and don't
        crave his delicacies:
023:007 for as he thinks about the cost, so he is.  "Eat and drink!"
        he says to you, but his heart is not with you.
023:008 The morsel which you have eaten you shall vomit up, and lose
        your good words.
023:009 Don't speak in the ears of a fool, for he will despise the wisdom
        of your words.
023:010 Don't move the ancient boundary stone.  Don't encroach on
        the fields of the fatherless:
023:011 for their Defender is strong.  He will plead their case against you.
023:012 Apply your heart to instruction, and your ears to the
        words of knowledge.
023:013 Don't withhold correction from a child.  If you punish him
        with the rod, he will not die.
023:014 Punish him with the rod, and save his soul from Sheol.
023:015 My son, if your heart is wise, then my heart will be glad, even mine:
023:016 yes, my heart will rejoice, when your lips speak what is right.
023:017 Don't let your heart envy sinners; but rather fear Yahweh
        all the day long.
023:018 Indeed surely there is a future hope, and your hope will not
        be cut off.
023:019 Listen, my son, and be wise, and keep your heart on the right path!
023:020 Don't be among ones drinking too much wine, or those who gorge
        themselves on meat:
023:021 for the drunkard and the glutton shall become poor;
        and drowsiness clothes them in rags.
023:022 Listen to your father who gave you life, and don't despise
        your mother when she is old.
023:023 Buy the truth, and don't sell it.  Get wisdom, discipline,
        and understanding.
023:024 The father of the righteous has great joy.  Whoever fathers
        a wise child delights in him.
023:025 Let your father and your mother be glad!  Let her who
        bore you rejoice!
023:026 My son, give me your heart; and let your eyes keep in my ways.
023:027 For a prostitute is a deep pit; and a wayward wife is
        a narrow well.
023:028 Yes, she lies in wait like a robber, and increases the
        unfaithful among men.
023:029 Who has woe?  Who has sorrow?  Who has strife?  Who has complaints?
        Who has needless bruises?  Who has bloodshot eyes?
023:030 Those who stay long at the wine; those who go to seek
        out mixed wine.
023:031 Don't look at the wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup,
        when it goes down smoothly.
023:032 In the end, it bites like a snake, and poisons like a viper.
023:033 Your eyes will see strange things, and your mind will
        imagine confusing things.
023:034 Yes, you will be as he who lies down in the midst of the sea,
        or as he who lies on top of the rigging:
023:035 "They hit me, and I was not hurt!  They beat me, and I
        don't feel it!  When will I wake up?  I can do it again.
        I can find another."
024:001 Don't be envious of evil men; neither desire to be with them:
024:002 for their hearts plot violence, and their lips talk about mischief.
024:003 Through wisdom a house is built; by understanding it is established;
024:004 by knowledge the rooms are filled with all rare
        and beautiful treasure.
024:005 A wise man has great power; and a knowledgeable
        man increases strength;
024:006 for by wise guidance you wage your war; and victory is
        in many advisors.
024:007 Wisdom is too high for a fool:  he doesn't open his mouth
        in the gate.
024:008 One who plots to do evil will be called a schemer.
024:009 The schemes of folly are sin.  The mocker is detested by men.
024:010 If you falter in the time of trouble, your strength is small.
024:011 Rescue those who are being led away to death!  Indeed, hold back
        those who are staggering to the slaughter!
024:012 If you say, "Behold, we didn't know this;" doesn't he who weighs
        the hearts consider it?  He who keeps your soul, doesn't he know it?
        Shall he not render to every man according to his work?
024:013 My son, eat honey, for it is good; the droppings of the honeycomb,
        which are sweet to your taste:
024:014 so you shall know wisdom to be to your soul; if you have found it,
        then there will be a reward, your hope will not be cut off.
024:015 Don't lay in wait, wicked man, against the habitation of
        the righteous.  Don't destroy his resting place:
024:016 for a righteous man falls seven times, and rises up again;
        but the wicked are overthrown by calamity.
024:017 Don't rejoice when your enemy falls.  Don't let your heart
        be glad when he is overthrown;
024:018 lest Yahweh see it, and it displease him, and he turn away
        his wrath from him.
024:019 Don't fret yourself because of evildoers; neither be envious
        of the wicked:
024:020 for there will be no reward to the evil man; and the lamp
        of the wicked shall be snuffed out.
024:021 My son, fear Yahweh and the king.  Don't join those
        who are rebellious:
024:022 for their calamity will rise suddenly; the destruction from
        them both--who knows?
024:023 These also are sayings of the wise.  To show partiality
        in judgment is not good.
024:024 He who says to the wicked, "You are righteous;" peoples shall
        curse him, and nations shall abhor him--
024:025 but it will go well with those who convict the guilty,
        and a rich blessing will come on them.
024:026 An honest answer is like a kiss on the lips.
024:027 Prepare your work outside, and get your fields ready.
        Afterwards, build your house.
024:028 Don't be a witness against your neighbor without cause.
        Don't deceive with your lips.
024:029 Don't say, "I will do to him as he has done to me; I will render
        to the man according to his work."
024:030 I went by the field of the sluggard, by the vineyard of the man
        void of understanding;
024:031 Behold, it was all grown over with thorns.  Its surface was
        covered with nettles, and its stone wall was broken down.
024:032 Then I saw, and considered well.  I saw, and received instruction:
024:033 a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the
        hands to sleep;
024:034 so shall your poverty come as a robber, and your want as
        an armed man.
025:001 These also are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah
        king of Judah copied out.
025:002 It is the glory of God to conceal a thing, but the glory
        of kings is to search out a matter.
025:003 As the heavens for height, and the earth for depth, so the hearts
        of kings are unsearchable.
025:004 Take away the dross from the silver, and material comes out
        for the refiner;
025:005 Take away the wicked from the king's presence, and his throne
        will be established in righteousness.
025:006 Don't exalt yourself in the presence of the king, or claim
        a place among great men;
025:007 for it is better that it be said to you, "Come up here,"
        than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince,
        whom your eyes have seen.
025:008 Don't be hasty in bringing charges to court.  What will you
        do in the end when your neighbor shames you?
025:009 Debate your case with your neighbor, and don't betray
        the confidence of another;
025:010 lest one who hears it put you to shame, and your bad
        reputation never depart.
025:011 A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in settings of silver.
025:012 As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold,
        so is a wise reprover to an obedient ear.
025:013 As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful
        messenger to those who send him; for he refreshes the soul
        of his masters.
025:014 As clouds and wind without rain, so is he who boasts
        of gifts deceptively.
025:015 By patience a ruler is persuaded.  A soft tongue breaks the bone.
025:016 Have you found honey?  Eat as much as is sufficient for you,
        lest you eat too much, and vomit it.
025:017 Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor's house, lest he be
        weary of you, and hate you.
025:018 A man who gives false testimony against his neighbor is like a club,
        a sword, or a sharp arrow.
025:019 Confidence in someone unfaithful in time of trouble is like
        a bad tooth, or a lame foot.
025:020 As one who takes away a garment in cold weather, or vinegar
        on soda, so is one who sings songs to a heavy heart.
025:021 If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat.  If he is thirsty,
        give him water to drink:
025:022 for you will heap coals of fire on his head, and Yahweh
        will reward you.
025:023 The north wind brings forth rain:  so a backbiting tongue
        brings an angry face.
025:024 It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop,
        than to share a house with a contentious woman.
025:025 Like cold water to a thirsty soul, so is good news from
        a far country.
025:026 Like a muddied spring, and a polluted well, so is a righteous
        man who gives way before the wicked.
025:027 It is not good to eat much honey; nor is it honorable to seek
        one's own honor.
025:028 Like a city that is broken down and without walls is a man
        whose spirit is without restraint.
026:001 Like snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honor is not
        fitting for a fool.
026:002 Like a fluttering sparrow, like a darting swallow,
        so the undeserved curse doesn't come to rest.
026:003 A whip is for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, and a rod
        for the back of fools!
026:004 Don't answer a fool according to his folly, lest you also
        be like him.
026:005 Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in
        his own eyes.
026:006 One who sends a message by the hand of a fool is cutting off
        feet and drinking violence.
026:007 Like the legs of the lame that hang loose:  so is a parable
        in the mouth of fools.
026:008 As one who binds a stone in a sling, so is he who gives honor
        to a fool.
026:009 Like a thornbush that goes into the hand of a drunkard,
        so is a parable in the mouth of fools.
026:010 As an archer who wounds all, so is he who hires a fool
        or he who hires those who pass by.
026:011 As a dog that returns to his vomit, so is a fool who
        repeats his folly.
026:012 Do you see a man wise in his own eyes?  There is more hope
        for a fool than for him.
026:013 The sluggard says, "There is a lion in the road!
        A fierce lion roams the streets!"
026:014 As the door turns on its hinges, so does the sluggard on his bed.
026:015 The sluggard buries his hand in the dish.  He is too lazy
        to bring it back to his mouth.
026:016 The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes than seven men who
        answer with discretion.
026:017 Like one who grabs a dog's ears is one who passes by and meddles
        in a quarrel not his own.
026:018 Like a madman who shoots firebrands, arrows, and death,
026:019 is the man who deceives his neighbor and says, "Am I not joking?"
026:020 For lack of wood a fire goes out.  Without gossip,
        a quarrel dies down.
026:021 As coals are to hot embers, and wood to fire, so is a contentious
        man to kindling strife.
026:022 The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels, they go down
        into the innermost parts.
026:023 Like silver dross on an earthen vessel are the lips of a fervent
        one with an evil heart.
026:024 A malicious man disguises himself with his lips, but he harbors
        evil in his heart.
026:025 When his speech is charming, don't believe him; for there
        are seven abominations in his heart.
026:026 His malice may be concealed by deception, but his wickedness
        will be exposed in the assembly.
026:027 Whoever digs a pit shall fall into it.  Whoever rolls a stone,
        it will come back on him.
026:028 A lying tongue hates those it hurts; and a flattering
        mouth works ruin.
027:001 Don't boast about tomorrow; for you don't know what a day
        may bring forth.
027:002 Let another man praise you, and not your own mouth; a stranger,
        and not your own lips.
027:003 A stone is heavy, and sand is a burden; but a fool's provocation
        is heavier than both.
027:004 Wrath is cruel, and anger is overwhelming; but who is able
        to stand before jealousy?
027:005 Better is open rebuke than hidden love.
027:006 Faithful are the wounds of a friend; although the kisses
        of an enemy are profuse.
027:007 A full soul loathes a honeycomb; but to a hungry soul,
        every bitter thing is sweet.
027:008 As a bird that wanders from her nest, so is a man who wanders
        from his home.
027:009 Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart; so does earnest
        counsel from a man's friend.
027:010 Don't forsake your friend and your father's friend.
        Don't go to your brother's house in the day of your disaster:
        better is a neighbor who is near than a distant brother.
027:011 Be wise, my son, and bring joy to my heart, then I can
        answer my tormentor.
027:012 A prudent man sees danger and takes refuge; but the simple
        pass on, and suffer for it.
027:013 Take his garment when he puts up collateral for a stranger.
        Hold it for a wayward woman!
027:014 He who blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning,
        it will be taken as a curse by him.
027:015 A continual dropping on a rainy day and a contentious
        wife are alike:
027:016 restraining her is like restraining the wind, or like grasping
        oil in his right hand.
027:017 Iron sharpens iron; so a man sharpens his friend's countenance.
027:018 Whoever tends the fig tree shall eat its fruit.
        He who looks after his master shall be honored.
027:019 As water reflects a face, so a man's heart reflects the man.
027:020 Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied; and a man's eyes
        are never satisfied.
027:021 The crucible is for silver, and the furnace for gold;
        but man is refined by his praise.
027:022 Though you grind a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with grain,
        yet his foolishness will not be removed from him.
027:023 Know well the state of your flocks, and pay attention
        to your herds:
027:024 for riches are not forever, nor does even the crown endure
        to all generations.
027:025 The hay is removed, and the new growth appears, the grasses
        of the hills are gathered in.
027:026 The lambs are for your clothing, and the goats are the price
        of a field.
027:027 There will be plenty of goats' milk for your food, for your
        family's food, and for the nourishment of your servant girls.
028:001 The wicked flee when no one pursues; but the righteous are
        as bold as a lion.
028:002 In rebellion, a land has many rulers, but order is maintained
        by a man of understanding and knowledge.
028:003 A needy man who oppresses the poor is like a driving rain
        which leaves no crops.
028:004 Those who forsake the law praise the wicked; but those who keep
        the law contend with them.
028:005 Evil men don't understand justice; but those who seek Yahweh
        understand it fully.
028:006 Better is the poor who walks in his integrity, than he who is
        perverse in his ways, and he is rich.
028:007 Whoever keeps the law is a wise son; but he who is a companion
        of gluttons shames his father.
028:008 He who increases his wealth by excessive interest gathers it
        for one who has pity on the poor.
028:009 He who turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer
        is an abomination.
028:010 Whoever causes the upright to go astray in an evil way, he will
        fall into his own trap; but the blameless will inherit good.
028:011 The rich man is wise in his own eyes; but the poor who has
        understanding sees through him.
028:012 When the righteous triumph, there is great glory; but when
        the wicked rise, men hide themselves.
028:013 He who conceals his sins doesn't prosper, but whoever confesses
        and renounces them finds mercy.
028:014 Blessed is the man who always fears; but one who hardens his
        heart falls into trouble.
028:015 As a roaring lion or a charging bear, so is a wicked ruler
        over helpless people.
028:016 A tyrannical ruler lacks judgment.  One who hates ill-gotten
        gain will have long days.
028:017 A man who is tormented by life blood will be a fugitive until death;
        no one will support him.
028:018 Whoever walks blamelessly is kept safe; but one with perverse
        ways will fall suddenly.
028:019 One who works his land will have an abundance of food;
        but one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty.
028:020 A faithful man is rich with blessings; but one who is eager
        to be rich will not go unpunished.
028:021 To show partiality is not good; yet a man will do wrong
        for a piece of bread.
028:022 A stingy man hurries after riches, and doesn't know that poverty
        waits for him.
028:023 One who rebukes a man will afterward find more favor than one
        who flatters with the tongue.
028:024 Whoever robs his father or his mother, and says, "It's not wrong."
        He is a partner with a destroyer.
028:025 One who is greedy stirs up strife; but one who trusts in
        Yahweh will prosper.
028:026 One who trusts in himself is a fool; but one who walks in wisdom
        is kept safe.
028:027 One who gives to the poor has no lack; but one who closes
        his eyes will have many curses.
028:028 When the wicked rise, men hide themselves; but when they perish,
        the righteous thrive.
029:001 He who is often rebuked and stiffens his neck will be
        destroyed suddenly, with no remedy.
029:002 When the righteous thrive, the people rejoice; but when
        the wicked rule, the people groan.
029:003 Whoever loves wisdom brings joy to his father; but a companion
        of prostitutes squanders his wealth.
029:004 The king by justice makes the land stable, but he who takes
        bribes tears it down.
029:005 A man who flatters his neighbor spreads a net for his feet.
029:006 An evil man is snared by his sin, but the righteous can sing
        and be glad.
029:007 The righteous care about justice for the poor.  The wicked
        aren't concerned about knowledge.
029:008 Mockers stir up a city, but wise men turn away anger.
029:009 If a wise man goes to court with a foolish man, the fool rages
        or scoffs, and there is no peace.
029:010 The bloodthirsty hate a man of integrity; and they seek the life
        of the upright.
029:011 A fool vents all of his anger, but a wise man brings
        himself under control.
029:012 If a ruler listens to lies, all of his officials are wicked.
029:013 The poor man and the oppressor have this in common:
        Yahweh gives sight to the eyes of both.
029:014 The king who fairly judges the poor, his throne shall
        be established forever.
029:015 The rod of correction gives wisdom, but a child left to himself
        causes shame to his mother.
029:016 When the wicked increase, sin increases; but the righteous
        will see their downfall.
029:017 Correct your son, and he will give you peace; yes, he will bring
        delight to your soul.
029:018 Where there is no revelation, the people cast off restraint;
        but one who keeps the law is blessed.
029:019 A servant can't be corrected by words.  Though he understands,
        yet he will not respond.
029:020 Do you see a man who is hasty in his words?  There is more hope
        for a fool than for him.
029:021 He who pampers his servant from youth will have him become
        a son in the end.
029:022 An angry man stirs up strife, and a wrathful man abounds in sin.
029:023 A man's pride brings him low, but one of lowly spirit gains honor.
029:024 Whoever is an accomplice of a thief is an enemy of his own soul.
        He takes an oath, but dares not testify.
029:025 The fear of man proves to be a snare, but whoever puts his trust
        in Yahweh is kept safe.
029:026 Many seek the ruler's favor, but a man's justice comes from Yahweh.
029:027 A dishonest man detests the righteous, and the upright in their
        ways detest the wicked.
030:001 The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, the oracle:
        the man says to Ithiel, to Ithiel and Ucal:
030:002 "Surely I am the most ignorant man, and don't have
        a man's understanding.
030:003 I have not learned wisdom, neither do I have the knowledge
        of the Holy One.
030:004 Who has ascended up into heaven, and descended?  Who has
        gathered the wind in his fists?  Who has bound the waters
        in his garment?  Who has established all the ends of the earth?
        What is his name, and what is his son's name, if you know?
030:005 "Every word of God is flawless.  He is a shield to those who take
        refuge in him.
030:006 Don't you add to his words, lest he reprove you, and you
        be found a liar.
030:007 "Two things I have asked of you; don't deny me before I die:
030:008 Remove far from me falsehood and lies.  Give me neither poverty
        nor riches.  Feed me with the food that is needful for me;
030:009 lest I be full, deny you, and say, 'Who is Yahweh?' or lest
        I be poor, and steal, and so dishonor the name of my God.
030:010 "Don't slander a servant to his master, lest he curse you,
        and you be held guilty.
030:011 There is a generation that curses their father, and doesn't
        bless their mother.
030:012 There is a generation that is pure in their own eyes,
        yet are not washed from their filthiness.
030:013 There is a generation, oh how lofty are their eyes!
        Their eyelids are lifted up.
030:014 There is a generation whose teeth are like swords, and their
        jaws like knives, to devour the poor from the earth,
        and the needy from among men.
030:015 "The leach has two daughters:  'Give, give.'  "There are three
        things that are never satisfied; four that don't say, 'Enough:'
030:016 Sheol, the barren womb; the earth that is not satisfied with water;
        and the fire that doesn't say, 'Enough.'
030:017 "The eye that mocks at his father, and scorns obedience
        to his mother:  the ravens of the valley shall pick it out,
        the young eagles shall eat it.
030:018 "There are three things which are too amazing for me,
        four which I don't understand:
030:019 The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent on a rock;
        the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man
        with a maiden.
030:020 "So is the way of an adulterous woman:  she eats and wipes
        her mouth, and says, 'I have done nothing wrong.'
030:021 "For three things the earth tremble, and under four,
        it can't bear up:
030:022 For a servant when he is king; a fool when he is filled with food;
030:023 for an unloved woman when she is married; and a handmaid
        who is heir to her mistress.
030:024 "There are four things which are little on the earth,
        but they are exceedingly wise:
030:025 the ants are not a strong people, yet they provide their food
        in the summer.
030:026 The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses
        in the rocks.
030:027 The locusts have no king, yet they advance in ranks.
030:028 You can catch a lizard with your hands, yet it is in kings' palaces.
030:029 "There are three things which are stately in their march,
        four which are stately in going:
030:030 The lion, which is mightiest among animals, and doesn't turn
        away for any;
030:031 the greyhound, the male goat also; and the king against whom
        there is no rising up.
030:032 "If you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself, or if you
        have thought evil, put your hand over your mouth.
030:033 For as the churning of milk brings forth butter, and the wringing
        of the nose brings forth blood; so the forcing of wrath
        brings forth strife."
031:001 The words of king Lemuel; the oracle which his mother taught him.
031:002 "Oh, my son!  Oh, son of my womb!  Oh, son of my vows!
031:003 Don't give your strength to women, nor your ways to that
        which destroys kings.
031:004 It is not for kings, Lemuel; it is not for kings to drink wine;
        nor for princes to say, 'Where is strong drink?'
031:005 lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the justice
        due to anyone who is afflicted.
031:006 Give strong drink to him who is ready to perish; and wine
        to the bitter in soul:
031:007 Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his
        misery no more.
031:008 Open your mouth for the mute, in the cause of all who
        are left desolate.
031:009 Open your mouth, judge righteously, and serve justice to
        the poor and needy."
031:010 {Proverbs 31:10-31 form an acrostic, with each verse starting
        with each letter of the Hebrew alphabet, in order.}Who can
        find a worthy woman?  For her price is far above rubies.
031:011 The heart of her husband trusts in her.  He shall have no
        lack of gain.
031:012 She does him good, and not harm, all the days of her life.
031:013 She seeks wool and flax, and works eagerly with her hands.
031:014 She is like the merchant ships.  She brings her bread from afar.
031:015 She rises also while it is yet night, gives food to her household,
        and portions for her servant girls.
031:016 She considers a field, and buys it.  With the fruit of her hands,
        she plants a vineyard.
031:017 She girds her waist with strength, and makes her arms strong.
031:018 She perceives that her merchandise is profitable.
        Her lamp doesn't go out by night.
031:019 She lays her hands to the distaff, and her hands hold the spindle.
031:020 She opens her arms to the poor; yes, she extends her hands
        to the needy.
031:021 She is not afraid of the snow for her household; for all her
        household are clothed with scarlet.
031:022 She makes for herself carpets of tapestry.  Her clothing
        is fine linen and purple.
031:023 Her husband is respected in the gates, when he sits among
        the elders of the land.
031:024 She makes linen garments and sells them, and delivers sashes
        to the merchant.
031:025 Strength and dignity are her clothing.  She laughs at
        the time to come.
031:026 She opens her mouth with wisdom.  Faithful instruction is
        on her tongue.
031:027 She looks well to the ways of her household, and doesn't eat
        the bread of idleness.
031:028 Her children rise up and call her blessed.  Her husband
        also praises her:
031:029 "Many women do noble things, but you excel them all."
031:030 Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain; but a woman who fears Yahweh,
        she shall be praised.
031:031 Give her of the fruit of her hands!  Let her works praise
        her in the gates!

Book 21 Ecclesiastes
001:001 The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem:
001:002 "Vanity of vanities," says the Preacher; "Vanity of vanities,
        all is vanity."
001:003 What does man gain from all his labor in which he labors
        under the sun?
001:004 One generation goes, and another generation comes;
        but the earth remains forever.
001:005 The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, and hurries to its
        place where it rises.
001:006 The wind goes toward the south, and turns around to the north.
        It turns around continually as it goes, and the wind returns
        again to its courses.
001:007 All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full.
        To the place where the rivers flow, there they flow again.
001:008 All things are full of weariness beyond uttering.  The eye is
        not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.
001:009 That which has been is that which shall be; and that which has
        been done is that which shall be done:  and there is no new
        thing under the sun.
001:010 Is there a thing of which it may be said, "Behold, this is new?"
        It has been long ago, in the ages which were before us.
001:011 There is no memory of the former; neither shall there be any
        memory of the latter that are to come, among those that
        shall come after.
001:012 I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
001:013 I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning
        all that is done under the sky.  It is a heavy burden that God
        has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with.
001:014 I have seen all the works that are done under the sun;
        and behold, all is vanity and a chasing after wind.
001:015 That which is crooked can't be made straight; and that which is
        lacking can't be counted.
001:016 I said to myself, "Behold, I have obtained for myself
        great wisdom above all who were before me in Jerusalem.
        Yes, my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge."
001:017 I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly.
        I perceived that this also was a chasing after wind.
001:018 For in much wisdom is much grief; and he who increases
        knowledge increases sorrow.
002:001 I said in my heart, "Come now, I will test you with mirth:
        therefore enjoy pleasure;" and behold, this also was vanity.
002:002 I said of laughter, "It is foolishness;" and of mirth,
        "What does it accomplish?"
002:003 I searched in my heart how to cheer my flesh with wine, my heart
        yet guiding me with wisdom, and how to lay hold of folly,
        until I might see what it was good for the sons of men that they
        should do under heaven all the days of their lives.
002:004 I made myself great works.  I built myself houses.
        I planted myself vineyards.
002:005 I made myself gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them
        of all kinds of fruit.
002:006 I made myself pools of water, to water from it the forest
        where trees were reared.
002:007 I bought male servants and female servants, and had servants born
        in my house.  I also had great possessions of herds and flocks,
        above all who were before me in Jerusalem;
002:008 I also gathered silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings
        and of the provinces.  I got myself male and female singers,
        and the delights of the sons of men--musical instruments,
        and that of all sorts.
002:009 So I was great, and increased more than all who were before me
        in Jerusalem.  My wisdom also remained with me.
002:010 Whatever my eyes desired, I didn't keep from them.
        I didn't withhold my heart from any joy, for my heart
        rejoiced because of all my labor, and this was my portion
        from all my labor.
002:011 Then I looked at all the works that my hands had worked,
        and at the labor that I had labored to do; and behold,
        all was vanity and a chasing after wind, and there was no
        profit under the sun.
002:012 I turned myself to consider wisdom, madness, and folly:
        for what can the king's successor do?  Just that which has
        been done long ago.
002:013 Then I saw that wisdom excels folly, as far as light excels darkness.
002:014 The wise man's eyes are in his head, and the fool walks in darkness--
        and yet I perceived that one event happens to them all.
002:015 Then said I in my heart, "As it happens to the fool,
        so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise?"
        Then said I in my heart that this also is vanity.
002:016 For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no memory
        for ever, seeing that in the days to come all will have
        been long forgotten.  Indeed, the wise man must die just
        like the fool!
002:017 So I hated life, because the work that is worked under the sun
        was grievous to me; for all is vanity and a chasing after wind.
002:018 I hated all my labor in which I labored under the sun,
        seeing that I must leave it to the man who comes after me.
002:019 Who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool?
        Yet he will have rule over all of my labor in which I have labored,
        and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun.
        This also is vanity.
002:020 Therefore I began to cause my heart to despair concerning
        all the labor in which I had labored under the sun.
002:021 For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, with knowledge,
        and with skillfulness; yet he shall leave it for his portion
        to a man who has not labored for it.  This also is vanity
        and a great evil.
002:022 For what has a man of all his labor, and of the striving
        of his heart, in which he labors under the sun?
002:023 For all his days are sorrows, and his travail is grief;
        yes, even in the night his heart takes no rest.
        This also is vanity.
002:024 There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat
        and drink, and make his soul enjoy good in his labor.
        This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.
002:025 For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I?
002:026 For to the man who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge,
        and joy; but to the sinner he gives travail, to gather
        and to heap up, that he may give to him who pleases God.
        This also is vanity and a chasing after wind.
003:001 For everything there is a season, and a time for every
        purpose under heaven:
003:002 a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant,
        and a time to pluck up that which is planted;
003:003 a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down,
        and a time to build up;
003:004 a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn,
        and a time to dance;
003:005 a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together;
        a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
003:006 a time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time
        to cast away;
003:007 a time to tear, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence,
        and a time to speak;
003:008 a time to love, and a time to hate; a time for war,
        and a time for peace.
003:009 What profit has he who works in that in which he labors?
003:010 I have seen the burden which God has given to the sons of men
        to be afflicted with.
003:011 He has made everything beautiful in its time.  He has also set
        eternity in their hearts, yet so that man can't find out the work
        that God has done from the beginning even to the end.
003:012 I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice,
        and to do good as long as they live.
003:013 Also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy good in all
        his labor, is the gift of God.
003:014 I know that whatever God does, it shall be forever.
        Nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it;
        and God has done it, that men should fear before him.
003:015 That which is has been long ago, and that which is to be has
        been long ago:  and God seeks again that which is passed away.
003:016 Moreover I saw under the sun, in the place of justice,
        that wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness,
        that wickedness was there.
003:017 I said in my heart, "God will judge the righteous and the wicked;
        for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work."
003:018 I said in my heart, "As for the sons of men, God tests them,
        so that they may see that they themselves are like animals.
003:019 For that which happens to the sons of men happens to animals.
        Even one thing happens to them.  As the one dies,
        so the other dies.  Yes, they have all one breath; and man
        has no advantage over the animals:  for all is vanity.
003:020 All go to one place.  All are from the dust, and all turn
        to dust again.
003:021 Who knows the spirit of man, whether it goes upward,
        and the spirit of the animal, whether it goes downward
        to the earth?"
003:022 Therefore I saw that there is nothing better, than that a man
        should rejoice in his works; for that is his portion:
        for who can bring him to see what will be after him?
004:001 Then I returned and saw all the oppressions that are done under
        the sun:  and behold, the tears of those who were oppressed,
        and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors
        there was power; but they had no comforter.
004:002 Therefore I praised the dead who have been long dead more than
        the living who are yet alive.
004:003 Yes, better than them both is him who has not yet been,
        who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.
004:004 Then I saw all the labor and achievement that is the envy of a
        man's neighbor.  This also is vanity and a striving after wind.
004:005 The fool folds his hands together and ruins himself.
004:006 Better is a handful, with quietness, than two handfuls with labor
        and chasing after wind.
004:007 Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun.
004:008 There is one who is alone, and he has neither son nor brother.
        There is no end to all of his labor, neither are his eyes
        satisfied with wealth.  For whom then, do I labor, and deprive
        my soul of enjoyment?  This also is vanity, yes, it is
        a miserable business.
004:009 Two are better than one, because they have a good reward
        for their labor.
004:010 For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe
        to him who is alone when he falls, and doesn't have another
        to lift him up.
004:011 Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can
        one keep warm alone?
004:012 If a man prevails against one who is alone, two shall withstand him;
        and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
004:013 Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king
        who doesn't know how to receive admonition any more.
004:014 For out of prison he came forth to be king; yes, even in his
        kingdom he was born poor.
004:015 I saw all the living who walk under the sun, that they were
        with the youth, the other, who succeeded him.
004:016 There was no end of all the people, even of all them over whom
        he was--yet those who come after shall not rejoice in him.
        Surely this also is vanity and a chasing after wind.
005:001 Guard your steps when you go to God's house; for to draw near
        to listen is better than to give the sacrifice of fools,
        for they don't know that they do evil.
005:002 Don't be rash with your mouth, and don't let your heart be
        hasty to utter anything before God; for God is in heaven,
        and you on earth.  Therefore let your words be few.
005:003 For as a dream comes with a multitude of cares, so a fool's
        speech with a multitude of words.
005:004 When you vow a vow to God, don't defer to pay it; for he has
        no pleasure in fools.  Pay that which you vow.
005:005 It is better that you should not vow, than that you should vow
        and not pay.
005:006 Don't allow your mouth to lead you into sin.
        Don't protest before the messenger that this was a mistake.
        Why should God be angry at your voice, and destroy the work
        of your hands?
005:007 For in the multitude of dreams there are vanities, as well
        as in many words:  but you must fear God.
005:008 If you see the oppression of the poor, and the violent taking
        away of justice and righteousness in a district, don't marvel
        at the matter:  for one official is eyed by a higher one;
        and there are officials over them.
005:009 Moreover the profit of the earth is for all.  The king profits
        from the field.
005:010 He who loves silver shall not be satisfied with silver;
        nor he who loves abundance, with increase:  this also is vanity.
005:011 When goods increase, those who eat them are increased;
        and what advantage is there to its owner, except to feast
        on them with his eyes?
005:012 The sleep of a laboring man is sweet, whether he eats little or much;
        but the abundance of the rich will not allow him to sleep.
005:013 There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun:
        wealth kept by its owner to his harm.
005:014 Those riches perish by misfortune, and if he has fathered a son,
        there is nothing in his hand.
005:015 As he came forth from his mother's womb, naked shall he go
        again as he came, and shall take nothing for his labor,
        which he may carry away in his hand.
005:016 This also is a grievous evil, that in all points as he came,
        so shall he go.  And what profit does he have who labors
        for the wind?
005:017 All his days he also eats in darkness, he is frustrated,
        and has sickness and wrath.
005:018 Behold, that which I have seen to be good and proper is for
        one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy good in all his labor,
        in which he labors under the sun, all the days of his life
        which God has given him; for this is his portion.
005:019 Every man also to whom God has given riches and wealth,
        and has given him power to eat of it, and to take his portion,
        and to rejoice in his labor--this is the gift of God.
005:020 For he shall not often reflect on the days of his life;
        because God occupies him with the joy of his heart.
006:001 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it
        is heavy on men:
006:002 a man to whom God gives riches, wealth, and honor,
        so that he lacks nothing for his soul of all that he desires,
        yet God gives him no power to eat of it, but an alien eats it.
        This is vanity, and it is an evil disease.
006:003 If a man fathers a hundred children, and lives many years,
        so that the days of his years are many, but his soul is not
        filled with good, and moreover he has no burial; I say,
        that an untimely birth is better than he:
006:004 for it comes in vanity, and departs in darkness, and its name
        is covered with darkness.
006:005 Moreover it has not seen the sun nor known it.  This has rest
        rather than the other.
006:006 Yes, though he live a thousand years twice told, and yet fails
        to enjoy good, don't all go to one place?
006:007 All the labor of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite
        is not filled.
006:008 For what advantage has the wise more than the fool?
        What has the poor man, that knows how to walk before the living?
006:009 Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire.
        This also is vanity and a chasing after wind.
006:010 Whatever has been, its name was given long ago; and it is
        known what man is; neither can he contend with him who is
        mightier than he.
006:011 For there are many words that create vanity.  What does
        that profit man?
006:012 For who knows what is good for man in life, all the days
        of his vain life which he spends like a shadow?
        For who can tell a man what will be after him under the sun?
007:001 A good name is better than fine perfume; and the day of death
        better than the day of one's birth.
007:002 It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go
        to the house of feasting:  for that is the end of all men,
        and the living should take this to heart.
007:003 Sorrow is better than laughter; for by the sadness of the face
        the heart is made good.
007:004 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart
        of fools is in the house of mirth.
007:005 It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man
        to hear the song of fools.
007:006 For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter
        of the fool.  This also is vanity.
007:007 Surely extortion makes the wise man foolish; and a bribe
        destroys the understanding.
007:008 Better is the end of a thing than its beginning.
        The patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.
007:009 Don't be hasty in your spirit to be angry, for anger rests
        in the bosom of fools.
007:010 Don't say, "Why were the former days better than these?"
        For you do not ask wisely about this.
007:011 Wisdom is as good as an inheritance.  Yes, it is more excellent
        for those who see the sun.
007:012 For wisdom is a defense, even as money is a defense;
        but the excellency of knowledge is that wisdom preserves
        the life of him who has it.
007:013 Consider the work of God, for who can make that straight,
        which he has made crooked?
007:014 In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of
        adversity consider; yes, God has made the one side by side
        with the other, to the end that man should not find out
        anything after him.
007:015 All this have I seen in my days of vanity:  there is a righteous
        man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked
        man who lives long in his evil-doing.
007:016 Don't be overly righteous, neither make yourself overly wise.
        Why should you destroy yourself?
007:017 Don't be too wicked, neither be foolish.  Why should you die
        before your time?
007:018 It is good that you should take hold of this.  Yes, also from
        that don't withdraw your hand; for he who fears God will come
        forth from them all.
007:019 Wisdom is a strength to the wise man more than ten rulers
        who are in a city.
007:020 Surely there is not a righteous man on earth, who does good
        and doesn't sin.
007:021 Also don't take heed to all words that are spoken, lest you
        hear your servant curse you;
007:022 for often your own heart knows that you yourself have
        likewise cursed others.
007:023 All this have I proved in wisdom.  I said, "I will be wise;"
        but it was far from me.
007:024 That which is, is far off and exceedingly deep.
        Who can find it out?
007:025 I turned around, and my heart sought to know and to search out,
        and to seek wisdom and the scheme of things, and to know
        that wickedness is stupidity, and that foolishness is madness.
007:026 I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares
        and traps, whose hands are chains.  Whoever pleases God shall
        escape from her; but the sinner will be ensnared by her.
007:027 Behold, this have I found, says the Preacher, one to another,
        to find out the scheme;
007:028 which my soul still seeks; but I have not found:
        one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among
        all those have I not found.
007:029 Behold, this only have I found:  that God made man upright;
        but they search for many schemes.
008:001 Who is like the wise man?  And who knows the interpretation of
        a thing?  A man's wisdom makes his face shine, and the hardness
        of his face is changed.
008:002 I say, "Keep the king's command!" because of the oath to God.
008:003 Don't be hasty to go out of his presence.  Don't persist
        in an evil thing, for he does whatever pleases him,
008:004 for the king's word is supreme.  Who can say to him,
        "What are you doing?"
008:005 Whoever keeps the commandment shall not come to harm,
        and his wise heart will know the time and procedure.
008:006 For there is a time and procedure for every purpose,
        although the misery of man is heavy on him.
008:007 For he doesn't know that which will be; for who can tell him
        how it will be?
008:008 There is no man who has power over the spirit to contain
        the spirit; neither does he have power over the day of death.
        There is no discharge in war; neither shall wickedness deliver
        those who practice it.
008:009 All this have I seen, and applied my mind to every work that is
        done under the sun.  There is a time in which one man has
        power over another to his hurt.
008:010 So I saw the wicked buried.  Indeed they came also from holiness.
        They went and were forgotten in the city where they did this.
        This also is vanity.
008:011 Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily,
        therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them
        to do evil.
008:012 Though a sinner commits crimes a hundred times, and lives long,
        yet surely I know that it will be better with those who fear God,
        who are reverent before him.
008:013 But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall
        he lengthen days like a shadow; because he doesn't fear God.
008:014 There is a vanity which is done on the earth, that there
        are righteous men to whom it happens according to the work
        of the wicked.  Again, there are wicked men to whom
        it happens according to the work of the righteous.
        I said that this also is vanity.
008:015 Then I commended mirth, because a man has no better thing
        under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be joyful:
        for that will accompany him in his labor all the days of his
        life which God has given him under the sun.
008:016 When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business
        that is done on the earth (for also there is that neither
        day nor night sees sleep with his eyes),
008:017 then I saw all the work of God, that man can't find out
        the work that is done under the sun, because however
        much a man labors to seek it out, yet he won't find it.
        Yes even though a wise man thinks he can comprehend it,
        he won't be able to find it.
009:001 For all this I laid to my heart, even to explore all this:
        that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand
        of God; whether it is love or hatred, man doesn't know it;
        all is before them.
009:002 All things come alike to all.  There is one event to the righteous
        and to the wicked; to the good, to the clean, to the unclean,
        to him who sacrifices, and to him who doesn't sacrifice.
        As is the good, so is the sinner; he who takes an oath,
        as he who fears an oath.
009:003 This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that there
        is one event to all:  yes also, the heart of the sons of men
        is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live,
        and after that they go to the dead.
009:004 For to him who is joined with all the living there is hope;
        for a living dog is better than a dead lion.
009:005 For the living know that they will die, but the dead don't
        know anything, neither do they have any more a reward;
        for the memory of them is forgotten.
009:006 Also their love, their hatred, and their envy has perished long ago;
        neither have they any more a portion forever in anything
        that is done under the sun.
009:007 Go your way--eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine
        with a merry heart; for God has already accepted your works.
009:008 Let your garments be always white, and don't let your
        head lack oil.
009:009 Live joyfully with the wife whom you love all the days of
        your life of vanity, which he has given you under the sun,
        all your days of vanity:  for that is your portion in life,
        and in your labor in which you labor under the sun.
009:010 Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might;
        for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom,
        in Sheol, where you are going.
009:011 I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift,
        nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise,
        nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men
        of skill; but time and chance happen to them all.
009:012 For man also doesn't know his time.  As the fish that are taken
        in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare,
        even so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it
        falls suddenly on them.
009:013 I have also seen wisdom under the sun in this way, and it
        seemed great to me.
009:014 There was a little city, and few men within it; and a great king
        came against it, besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it.
009:015 Now a poor wise man was found in it, and he by his wisdom
        delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.
009:016 Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength.  Nevertheless the poor
        man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.
009:017 The words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the cry
        of him who rules among fools.
009:018 Wisdom is better than weapons of war; but one sinner
        destroys much good.
010:001 Dead flies cause the oil of the perfumer to send forth an evil odor;
        so does a little folly outweigh wisdom and honor.
010:002 A wise man's heart is at his right hand, but a fool's heart
        at his left.
010:003 Yes also, when the fool walks by the way, his understanding
        fails him, and he says to everyone that he is a fool.
010:004 If the spirit of the ruler rises up against you, don't leave
        your place; for gentleness lays great offenses to rest.
010:005 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, the sort
        of error which proceeds from the ruler.
010:006 Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in a low place.
010:007 I have seen servants on horses, and princes walking like servants
        on the earth.
010:008 He who digs a pit may fall into it; and whoever breaks through
        a wall may be bitten by a snake.
010:009 Whoever carves out stones may be injured by them.
        Whoever splits wood may be endangered thereby.
010:010 If the axe is blunt, and one doesn't sharpen the edge,
        then he must use more strength; but skill brings success.
010:011 If the snake bites before it is charmed, then is there no profit
        for the charmer's tongue.
010:012 The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but a fool
        is swallowed by his own lips.
010:013 The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness;
        and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.
010:014 A fool also multiplies words.  Man doesn't know what will be;
        and that which will be after him, who can tell him?
010:015 The labor of fools wearies every one of them; for he doesn't
        know how to go to the city.
010:016 Woe to you, land, when your king is a child, and your princes
        eat in the morning!
010:017 Happy are you, land, when your king is the son of nobles,
        and your princes eat in due season, for strength,
        and not for drunkenness!
010:018 By slothfulness the roof sinks in; and through idleness
        of the hands the house leaks.
010:019 A feast is made for laughter, and wine makes the life glad;
        and money is the answer for all things.
010:020 Don't curse the king, no, not in your thoughts; and don't curse
        the rich in your bedchamber:  for a bird of the sky may carry
        your voice, and that which has wings may tell the matter.
011:001 Cast your bread on the waters; for you shall find it
        after many days.
011:002 Give a portion to seven, yes, even to eight; for you don't
        know what evil will be on the earth.
011:003 If the clouds are full of rain, they empty themselves on the earth;
        and if a tree falls toward the south, or toward the north,
        in the place where the tree falls, there shall it be.
011:004 He who observes the wind won't sow; and he who regards
        the clouds won't reap.
011:005 As you don't know what is the way of the wind, nor how the bones
        grow in the womb of her who is with child; even so you don't
        know the work of God who does all.
011:006 In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening don't withhold
        your hand; for you don't know which will prosper, whether this
        or that, or whether they both will be equally good.
011:007 Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes
        to see the sun.
011:008 Yes, if a man lives many years, let him rejoice in them all;
        but let him remember the days of darkness, for they shall be many.
        All that comes is vanity.
011:009 Rejoice, young man, in your youth, and let your heart cheer you
        in the days of your youth, and walk in the ways of your heart,
        and in the sight of your eyes; but know that for all these
        things God will bring you into judgment.
011:010 Therefore remove sorrow from your heart, and put away evil
        from your flesh; for youth and the dawn of life are vanity.
012:001 Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth,
        before the evil days come, and the years draw near, when you
        will say, "I have no pleasure in them;"
012:002 Before the sun, the light, the moon, and the stars are darkened,
        and the clouds return after the rain;
012:003 in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble,
        and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders
        cease because they are few, and those who look out of the
        windows are darkened,
012:004 and the doors shall be shut in the street; when the sound
        of the grinding is low, and one shall rise up at the voice
        of a bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought low;
012:005 yes, they shall be afraid of heights, and terrors will be in the way;
        and the almond tree shall blossom, and the grasshopper shall
        be a burden, and desire shall fail; because man goes to his
        everlasting home, and the mourners go about the streets:
012:006 before the silver cord is severed, or the golden bowl is broken,
        or the pitcher is broken at the spring, or the wheel broken
        at the cistern,
012:007 and the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit
        returns to God who gave it.
012:008 Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher.  All is vanity!
012:009 Further, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught
        the people knowledge.  Yes, he pondered, sought out, and set
        in order many proverbs.
012:010 The Preacher sought to find out acceptable words, and that
        which was written blamelessly, words of truth.
012:011 The words of the wise are like goads; and like nails
        well fastened are words from the masters of assemblies,
        which are given from one shepherd.
012:012 Furthermore, my son, be admonished:  of making many books there
        is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.
012:013 This is the end of the matter.  All has been heard.
        Fear God, and keep his commandments; for this is the whole
        duty of man.
012:014 For God will bring every work into judgment, with every
        hidden thing, whether it is good, or whether it is evil.

Book 22 Song of Solomon
001:001 The Song of songs, which is Solomon's. Beloved
001:002 Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth; for your love
        is better than wine.
001:003 Your oils have a pleasing fragrance.  Your name is oil poured forth,
        therefore the virgins love you.
001:004 Take me away with you.  Let us hurry.  The king has brought me
        into his chambers.  Friends We will be glad and rejoice in you.
        We will praise your love more than wine!  Beloved They are
        right to love you.
001:005 I am dark, but lovely, you daughters of Jerusalem,
        like Kedar's tents, like Solomon's curtains.
001:006 Don't stare at me because I am dark, because the sun has scorched me.
        My mother's sons were angry with me.  They made me keeper
        of the vineyards.  I haven't kept my own vineyard.
001:007 Tell me, you whom my soul loves, where you graze your flock,
        where you rest them at noon; For why should I be as one who is
        veiled beside the flocks of your companions?  Lover
001:008 If you don't know, most beautiful among women, follow the tracks
        of the sheep.  Graze your young goats beside the shepherds' tents.
001:009 I have compared you, my love, to a steed in Pharaoh's chariots.
001:010 Your cheeks are beautiful with earrings, your neck with
        strings of jewels.
001:011 We will make you earrings of gold, with studs of silver.
        Beloved
001:012 While the king sat at his table, my perfume spread its fragrance.
001:013 My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh, that lies between my breasts.
001:014 My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms from the vineyards
        of En Gedi.  Lover
001:015 Behold, you are beautiful, my love.  Behold, you are beautiful.
        Your eyes are doves.  Beloved
001:016 Behold, you are beautiful, my beloved, yes, pleasant; and our
        couch is verdant.  Lover
001:017 The beams of our house are cedars.  Our rafters are firs.
        Beloved
002:001 I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys.  Lover
002:002 As a lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.
        Beloved
002:003 As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved
        among the sons.  I sat down under his shadow with great delight,
        his fruit was sweet to my taste.
002:004 He brought me to the banquet hall.  His banner over me is love.
002:005 Strengthen me with raisins, refresh me with apples; For I am
        faint with love.
002:006 His left hand is under my head.  His right hand embraces me.
002:007 I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, or by
        the hinds of the field, that you not stir up, nor awaken love,
        until it so desires.
002:008 The voice of my beloved!  Behold, he comes, leaping on the mountains,
        skipping on the hills.
002:009 My beloved is like a roe or a young hart.  Behold, he stands
        behind our wall!  He looks in at the windows.  He glances
        through the lattice.
002:010 My beloved spoke, and said to me, "Rise up, my love,
        my beautiful one, and come away.
002:011 For, behold, the winter is past.  The rain is over and gone.
002:012 The flowers appear on the earth.  The time of the singing has come,
        and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.
002:013 The fig tree ripens her green figs.  The vines are in blossom.
        They give forth their fragrance.  Arise, my love, my beautiful one,
        and come away."  Lover
002:014 My dove in the clefts of the rock, In the hiding places of
        the mountainside, Let me see your face.  Let me hear your voice;
        for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely.
002:015 Catch for us the foxes, the little foxes that spoil the vineyards;
        for our vineyards are in blossom.  Beloved
002:016 My beloved is mine, and I am his.  He browses among the lilies.
002:017 Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved,
        and be like a roe or a young hart on the mountains of Bether.
003:001 By night on my bed, I sought him whom my soul loves.
        I sought him, but I didn't find him.
003:002 I will get up now, and go about the city; in the streets
        and in the squares I will seek him whom my soul loves.
        I sought him, but I didn't find him.
003:003 The watchmen who go about the city found me; "Have you seen
        him whom my soul loves?"
003:004 I had scarcely passed from them, when I found him whom my soul loves.
        I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him
        into my mother's house, into the chamber of her who conceived me.
003:005 I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, or by
        the hinds of the field, that you not stir up, nor awaken love,
        until it so desires.
003:006 Who is this who comes up from the wilderness like pillars
        of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all spices
        of the merchant?
003:007 Behold, it is Solomon's carriage!  Sixty mighty men are around it,
        of the mighty men of Israel.
003:008 They all handle the sword, and are expert in war.
        Every man has his sword on his thigh, because of fear
        in the night.
003:009 King Solomon made himself a carriage of the wood of Lebanon.
003:010 He made its pillars of silver, its bottom of gold,
        its seat of purple, its midst being paved with love,
        from the daughters of Jerusalem.
003:011 Go forth, you daughters of Zion, and see king Solomon,
        with the crown with which his mother has crowned him,
        in the day of his weddings, in the day of the gladness
        of his heart.  Lover
004:001 Behold, you are beautiful, my love.  Behold, you are beautiful.
        Your eyes are doves behind your veil.  Your hair is as a flock
        of goats, that descend from Mount Gilead.
004:002 Your teeth are like a newly shorn flock, which have come
        up from the washing, where every one of them has twins.
        None is bereaved among them.
004:003 Your lips are like scarlet thread.  Your mouth is lovely.
        Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind your veil.
004:004 Your neck is like David's tower built for an armory, whereon a
        thousand shields hang, all the shields of the mighty men.
004:005 Your two breasts are like two fawns that are twins of a roe,
        which feed among the lilies.
004:006 Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, I will go
        to the mountain of myrrh, to the hill of frankincense.
004:007 You are all beautiful, my love.  There is no spot in you.
004:008 Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, with me from Lebanon.
        Look from the top of Amana, from the top of Senir and Hermon,
        from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.
004:009 You have ravished my heart, my sister, my bride.
        You have ravished my heart with one of your eyes, with one
        chain of your neck.
004:010 How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride!
        How much better is your love than wine!  The fragrance of your
        perfumes than all manner of spices!
004:011 Your lips, my bride, drip like the honeycomb.  Honey and milk
        are under your tongue.  The smell of your garments is like
        the smell of Lebanon.
004:012 A locked up garden is my sister, my bride; a locked up spring,
        a sealed fountain.
004:013 Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates, with precious fruits:
        henna with spikenard plants,
004:014 spikenard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with every kind
        of incense tree; myrrh and aloes, with all the best spices,
004:015 a fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, flowing streams
        from Lebanon.  Beloved
004:016 Awake, north wind; and come, you south!  Blow on my garden,
        that its spices may flow out.  Let my beloved come into his garden,
        and taste his precious fruits.  Lover
005:001 I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride.
        I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my
        honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk.
        Friends Eat, friends!  Drink, yes, drink abundantly, beloved.
        Beloved
005:002 I was asleep, but my heart was awake.  It is the voice
        of my beloved who knocks:  "Open to me, my sister, my love,
        my dove, my undefiled; for my head is filled with dew,
        and my hair with the dampness of the night."
005:003 I have taken off my robe.  Indeed, must I put it on?
        I have washed my feet.  Indeed, must I soil them?
005:004 My beloved thrust his hand in through the latch opening.
        My heart pounded for him.
005:005 I rose up to open for my beloved.  My hands dripped with myrrh,
        my fingers with liquid myrrh, on the handles of the lock.
005:006 I opened to my beloved; but my beloved left; and had gone away.
        My heart went out when he spoke.  I looked for him, but I
        didn't find him.  I called him, but he didn't answer.
005:007 The watchmen who go about the city found me.  They beat me.
        They bruised me.  The keepers of the walls took my cloak
        away from me.
005:008 I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, If you find my beloved,
        that you tell him that I am faint with love.  Friends
005:009 How is your beloved better than another beloved, you fairest
        among women?  How is your beloved better than another beloved,
        that you do so adjure us?  Beloved
005:010 My beloved is white and ruddy.  The best among ten thousand.
005:011 His head is like the purest gold.  His hair is bushy,
        black as a raven.
005:012 His eyes are like doves beside the water brooks, washed with milk,
        mounted like jewels.
005:013 His cheeks are like a bed of spices with towers of perfumes.
        His lips are like lilies, dropping liquid myrrh.
005:014 His hands are like rings of gold set with beryl.
        His body is like ivory work overlaid with sapphires.
005:015 His legs are like pillars of marble set on sockets of fine gold.
        His appearance is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.
005:016 His mouth is sweetness; yes, he is altogether lovely.
        This is my beloved, and this is my friend, daughters of Jerusalem.
        Friends
006:001 Where has your beloved gone, you fairest among women?
        Where has your beloved turned, that we may seek him with you?
        Beloved
006:002 My beloved has gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices,
        to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
006:003 I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine.  He browses
        among the lilies,
006:004 You are beautiful, my love, as Tirzah, lovely as Jerusalem,
        awesome as an army with banners.
006:005 Turn away your eyes from me, for they have overcome me.
        Your hair is like a flock of goats, that lie along
        the side of Gilead.
006:006 Your teeth are like a flock of ewes, which have come up
        from the washing; of which every one has twins; none is
        bereaved among them.
006:007 Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind your veil.
006:008 There are sixty queens, eighty concubines, and virgins
        without number.
006:009 My dove, my perfect one, is unique.  She is her mother's
        only daughter.  She is the favorite one of her who bore her.
        The daughters saw her, and called her blessed; the queens
        and the concubines, and they praised her.
006:010 Who is she who looks forth as the morning, beautiful as the moon,
        clear as the sun, and awesome as an army with banners?
006:011 I went down into the nut tree grove, to see the green
        plants of the valley, to see whether the vine budded,
        and the pomegranates were in flower.
006:012 Without realizing it, my desire set me with my royal
        people's chariots.  Friends
006:013 Return, return, Shulammite!  Return, return, that we may gaze
        at you.  Lover Why do you desire to gaze at the Shulammite,
        as at the dance of Mahanaim?
007:001 How beautiful are your feet in sandals, prince's daughter!
        Your rounded thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands
        of a skillful workman.
007:002 Your body is like a round goblet, no mixed wine is wanting.
        Your waist is like a heap of wheat, set about with lilies.
007:003 Your two breasts are like two fawns, that are twins of a roe.
007:004 Your neck is like an ivory tower.  Your eyes are like the pools
        in Heshbon by the gate of Bathrabbim.  Your nose is like
        the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus.
007:005 Your head on you is like Carmel.  The hair of your head like purple.
        The king is held captive in its tresses.
007:006 How beautiful and how pleasant you are, love, for delights!
007:007 This, your stature, is like a palm tree, your breasts
        like its fruit.
007:008 I said, "I will climb up into the palm tree.  I will take hold
        of its fruit."  Let your breasts be like clusters of the vine,
        the smell of your breath like apples, Beloved
007:009 Your mouth like the best wine, that goes down smoothly for
        my beloved, gliding through the lips of those who are asleep.
007:010 I am my beloved's. His desire is toward me.
007:011 Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field.
        Let us lodge in the villages.
007:012 Let's go early up to the vineyards.  Let's see whether the vine
        has budded, its blossom is open, and the pomegranates are in flower.
        There I will give you my love.
007:013 The mandrakes give forth fragrance.  At our doors are all
        kinds of precious fruits, new and old, which I have stored
        up for you, my beloved.
008:001 Oh that you were like my brother, who sucked the breasts
        of my mother!  If I found you outside, I would kiss you;
        yes, and no one would despise me.
008:002 I would lead you, bringing you into my mother's house,
        who would instruct me.  I would have you drink spiced wine,
        of the juice of my pomegranate.
008:003 His left hand would be under my head.  His right hand
        would embrace me.
008:004 I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, that you not stir up,
        nor awaken love, until it so desires.  Friends
008:005 Who is this who comes up from the wilderness, leaning on
        her beloved?  Under the apple tree I aroused you.
        There your mother conceived you.  There she was in labor
        and bore you.
008:006 Set me as a seal on your heart, as a seal on your arm;
        for love is strong as death.  Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol.
        Its flashes are flashes of fire, a very flame of Yahweh.
008:007 Many waters can't quench love, neither can floods drown it.
        If a man would give all the wealth of his house for love,
        he would be utterly scorned.  Friends
008:008 We have a little sister.  She has no breasts.  What shall we
        do for our sister in the day when she is to be spoken for?
008:009 If she is a wall, we will build on her a turret of silver.
        if she is a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar.
        Beloved
008:010 I am a wall, and my breasts like towers, then I was in his eyes
        like one who found peace.
008:011 Solomon had a vineyard at Baal Hamon.  He leased out the vineyard
        to keepers.  Each was to bring a thousand shekels of silver
        for its fruit.
008:012 My own vineyard is before me.  The thousand are for you, Solomon;
        two hundred for those who tend its fruit.  Lover
008:013 You who dwell in the gardens, with friends in attendance,
        let me hear your voice!  Beloved
008:014 Come away, my beloved!  Be like a gazelle or a young stag
        on the mountains of spices!

Book 23 Isaiah
001:001 The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah
        and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah,
        kings of Judah.
001:002 Hear, heavens, and listen, earth; for Yahweh has spoken:
        I have nourished and brought up children, and they have
        rebelled against me.
001:003 The ox knows his owner, and the donkey his master's crib;
        but Israel doesn't know, my people don't consider.
001:004 Ah sinful nation, a people loaded with iniquity, a seed
        of evil-doers, children who deal corruptly!  They have
        forsaken Yahweh.  They have despised the Holy One of Israel.
        They are estranged and backward.
001:005 Why should you be beaten more, that you revolt more and more?
        The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.
001:006 From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness
        in it:  wounds, welts, and open sores.  They haven't been closed,
        neither bandaged, neither soothed with oil.
001:007 Your country is desolate.  Your cities are burned with fire.
        Strangers devour your land in your presence, and it is desolate,
        as overthrown by strangers.
001:008 The daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard,
        like a hut in a field of melons, like a besieged city.
001:009 Unless Yahweh of Armies had left to us a very small remnant,
        we would have been as Sodom; we would have been like Gomorrah.
001:010 Hear the word of Yahweh, you rulers of Sodom!  Listen to the law
        of our God, you people of Gomorrah!
001:011 "What are the multitude of your sacrifices to me?," says Yahweh.
        "I have had enough of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat
        of fed animals.  I don't delight in the blood of bulls,
        or of lambs, or of male goats.
001:012 When you come to appear before me, who has required this
        at your hand, to trample my courts?
001:013 Bring no more vain offerings.  Incense is an abomination to me;
        new moons, Sabbaths, and convocations:  I can't bear
        with evil assemblies.
001:014 My soul hates your New Moons and your appointed feasts.
        They are a burden to me.  I am weary of bearing them.
001:015 When you spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you.
        Yes, when you make many prayers, I will not hear.
        Your hands are full of blood.
001:016 Wash yourselves, make yourself clean.  Put away the evil
        of your doings from before my eyes.  Cease to do evil.
001:017 Learn to do well.  Seek justice.  Relieve the oppressed.
        Judge the fatherless.  Plead for the widow."
001:018 "Come now, and let us reason together," says Yahweh:  "Though your
        sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.
        Though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
001:019 If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good
        of the land;
001:020 but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured with the sword;
        for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it."
001:021 How the faithful city has become a prostitute!  She was full
        of justice; righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.
001:022 Your silver has become dross, your wine mixed with water.
001:023 Your princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves.
        Everyone loves bribes, and follows after rewards.
        They don't judge the fatherless, neither does the cause
        of the widow come to them.
001:024 Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, the Mighty One
        of Israel, says:  "Ah, I will get relief from my adversaries,
        and avenge myself of my enemies;
001:025 and I will turn my hand on you, thoroughly purge away your dross,
        and will take away all your tin.
001:026 I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counselors
        as at the beginning.  Afterward you shall be called 'The city
        of righteousness, a faithful town.'
001:027 Zion shall be redeemed with justice, and her converts
        with righteousness.
001:028 But the destruction of transgressors and sinners shall be together,
        and those who forsake Yahweh shall be consumed.
001:029 For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired,
        and you shall be confounded for the gardens that you have chosen.
001:030 For you shall be as an oak whose leaf fades, and as a garden
        that has no water.
001:031 The strong will be like tinder, and his work like a spark.
        They will both burn together, and no one will quench them."
002:001 This is what Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning
        Judah and Jerusalem.
002:002 It shall happen in the latter days, that the mountain of Yahweh's
        house shall be established on the top of the mountains,
        and shall be raised above the hills; and all nations shall
        flow to it.
002:003 Many peoples shall go and say, "Come, let's go up to
        the mountain of Yahweh, to the house of the God of Jacob;
        and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths."
        For out of Zion the law shall go forth, and the word of
        Yahweh from Jerusalem.
002:004 He will judge between the nations, and will decide
        concerning many peoples; and they shall beat their swords
        into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks.
        Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall
        they learn war any more.
002:005 House of Jacob, come, and let us walk in the light of Yahweh.
002:006 For you have forsaken your people, the house of Jacob,
        because they are filled from the east, with those who practice
        divination like the Philistines, and they clasp hands with
        the children of foreigners.
002:007 Their land is full of silver and gold, neither is there any
        end of their treasures.  Their land also is full of horses,
        neither is there any end of their chariots.
002:008 Their land also is full of idols.  They worship the work
        of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made.
002:009 Man is brought low, and mankind is humbled; therefore don't
        forgive them.
002:010 Enter into the rock, and hide in the dust, from before the terror
        of Yahweh, and from the glory of his majesty.
002:011 The lofty looks of man will be brought low, the haughtiness
        of men will be bowed down, and Yahweh alone will be exalted
        in that day.
002:012 For there will be a day of Yahweh of Armies for all that
        is proud and haughty, and for all that is lifted up;
        and it shall be brought low:
002:013 For all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up,
        for all the oaks of Bashan,
002:014 For all the high mountains, for all the hills that are lifted up,
002:015 For every lofty tower, for every fortified wall,
002:016 For all the ships of Tarshish, and for all pleasant imagery.
002:017 The loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness
        of men shall be brought low; and Yahweh alone shall be exalted
        in that day.
002:018 The idols shall utterly pass away.
002:019 Men shall go into the caves of the rocks, and into the holes
        of the earth, from before the terror of Yahweh, and from the glory
        of his majesty, when he arises to shake the earth mightily.
002:020 In that day, men shall cast away their idols of silver,
        and their idols of gold, which have been made for themselves
        to worship, to the moles and to the bats;
002:021 To go into the caverns of the rocks, and into the clefts
        of the ragged rocks, from before the terror of Yahweh,
        and from the glory of his majesty, when he arises to shake
        the earth mightily.
002:022 Stop trusting in man, whose breath is in his nostrils;
        for of what account is he?
003:001 For, behold, the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, takes away from Jerusalem
        and from Judah supply and support, the whole supply of bread,
        and the whole supply of water;
003:002 the mighty man, the man of war, the judge, the prophet,
        the diviner, the elder,
003:003 the captain of fifty, the honorable man, the counselor,
        the skilled craftsman, and the clever enchanter.
003:004 I will give boys to be their princes, and children shall
        rule over them.
003:005 The people will be oppressed, everyone by another, and everyone
        by his neighbor.  The child will behave himself proudly
        against the old man, and the base against the honorable.
003:006 Indeed a man shall take hold of his brother in the house
        of his father, saying, "You have clothing, you be our ruler,
        and let this ruin be under your hand."
003:007 In that day he will cry out, saying, I will not be a healer;
        for in my house is neither bread nor clothing.
        You shall not make me ruler of the people.
003:008 For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen; because their
        tongue and their doings are against Yahweh, to provoke the eyes
        of his glory.
003:009 The look of their faces testify against them.  They parade
        their sin like Sodom.  They don't hide it.  Woe to their soul!
        For they have brought disaster upon themselves.
003:010 Tell the righteous "Good!"  For they shall eat the fruit
        of their deeds.
003:011 Woe to the wicked!  Disaster is upon them; for the deeds
        of his hands will be paid back to him.
003:012 As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule
        over them.  My people, those who lead you cause you to err,
        and destroy the way of your paths.
003:013 Yahweh stands up to contend, and stands to judge the peoples.
003:014 Yahweh will enter into judgment with the elders of his people,
        and their leaders:  "It is you who have eaten up the vineyard.
        The spoil of the poor is in your houses.
003:015 What do you mean that you crush my people, and grind the face
        of the poor?" says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.
003:016 Moreover Yahweh said, "Because the daughters of Zion are haughty,
        and walk with outstretched necks and flirting eyes,
        walking to trip as they go, jingling ornaments on their feet;
003:017 therefore the Lord brings sores on the crown of the head
        of the women of Zion, and Yahweh will make their scalps bald."
003:018 In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets,
        the headbands, the crescent necklaces,
003:019 the earrings, the bracelets, the veils,
003:020 the headdresses, the ankle chains, the sashes, the perfume
        bottles, the charms,
003:021 the signet rings, the nose rings,
003:022 the fine robes, the capes, the cloaks, the purses,
003:023 the hand mirrors, the fine linen garments, the tiaras,
        and the shawls.
003:024 It shall happen that instead of sweet spices, there shall
        be rottenness; instead of a belt, a rope; instead of well
        set hair, baldness; instead of a robe, a girding of sackcloth;
        and branding instead of beauty.
003:025 Your men shall fall by the sword, and your mighty in the war.
003:026 Her gates shall lament and mourn; and she shall be desolate
        and sit on the ground.
004:001 Seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying,
        "We will eat our own bread, and wear our own clothing:
        only let us be called by your name.  Take away our reproach."
004:002 In that day, Yahweh's branch will be beautiful and glorious,
        and the fruit of the land will be the beauty and glory
        of the survivors of Israel.
004:003 It will happen, that he who is left in Zion, and he who remains
        in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even everyone who is
        written among the living in Jerusalem;
004:004 when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters
        of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from its midst,
        by the spirit of justice, and by the spirit of burning.
004:005 Yahweh will create over the whole habitation of Mount Zion,
        and over her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day,
        and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all
        the glory will be a canopy.
004:006 There will be a pavilion for a shade in the daytime from the heat,
        and for a refuge and for a shelter from storm and from rain.
005:001 Let me sing for my well beloved a song of my beloved about
        his vineyard.  My beloved had a vineyard on a very fruitful hill.
005:002 He dug it up, gathered out its stones, planted it with
        the choicest vine, built a tower in its midst, and also cut
        out a winepress therein.  He looked for it to yield grapes,
        but it yielded wild grapes.
005:003 "Now, inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, please judge
        between me and my vineyard.
005:004 What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have
        not done in it?  Why, when I looked for it to yield grapes,
        did it yield wild grapes?
005:005 Now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard.
        I will take away its hedge, and it will be eaten up.
        I will break down its wall of it, and it will be trampled down.
005:006 I will lay it a wasteland.  It won't be pruned nor hoed,
        but it will grow briers and thorns.  I will also command
        the clouds that they rain no rain on it."
005:007 For the vineyard of Yahweh of Armies is the house of Israel,
        and the men of Judah his pleasant plant:  and he looked
        for justice, but, behold, oppression; for righteousness,
        but, behold, a cry of distress.
005:008 Woe to those who join house to house, who lay field to field,
        until there is no room, and you are made to dwell alone
        in the midst of the land!
005:009 In my ears, Yahweh of Armies says:  "Surely many houses will
        be desolate, even great and beautiful, unoccupied.
005:010 For ten acres{literally, ten yokes, or the amount of land
        that ten yokes of oxen can plow in one day, which is about 10
        acres or 4 hectares.} of vineyard shall yield one bath,{1
        bath is about 22 litres, 5.8 U. S. gallons, or 4.8 imperial
        gallons} and a homer{1 homer is about 220 litres or 6 bushels}
        of seed shall yield an ephah.{1 ephah is about 22 litres or 0.6
        bushels or about 2 pecks)--only one tenth of what was sown.}"
005:011 Woe to those who rise up early in the morning, that they
        may follow strong drink; who stay late into the night,
        until wine inflames them!
005:012 The harp, lyre, tambourine, and flute, with wine, are at
        their feasts; but they don't regard the work of Yahweh,
        neither have they considered the operation of his hands.
005:013 Therefore my people go into captivity for lack of knowledge.
        Their honorable men are famished, and their multitudes are
        parched with thirst.
005:014 Therefore Sheol{Sheol is the place of the dead.} has enlarged
        its desire, and opened its mouth without measure; and their glory,
        their multitude, their pomp, and he who rejoices among them,
        descend into it.
005:015 So man is brought low, mankind is humbled, and the eyes
        of the arrogant ones are humbled;
005:016 but Yahweh of Armies is exalted in justice, and God the Holy One
        is sanctified in righteousness.
005:017 Then the lambs will graze as in their pasture, and strangers
        will eat the ruins of the rich.
005:018 Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of falsehood,
        and wickedness as with cart rope;
005:019 Who say, "Let him make speed, let him hasten his work,
        that we may see it; and let the counsel of the Holy One
        of Israel draw near and come, that we may know it!"
005:020 Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil; who put darkness
        for light, and light for darkness; who put bitter for sweet,
        and sweet for bitter!
005:021 Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, and prudent
        in their own sight!
005:022 Woe to those who are mighty to drink wine, and champions
        at mixing strong drink;
005:023 who acquit the guilty for a bribe, but deny justice
        for the innocent!
005:024 Therefore as the tongue of fire devours the stubble,
        and as the dry grass sinks down in the flame, so their root
        shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust;
        because they have rejected the law of Yahweh of Armies,
        and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
005:025 Therefore Yahweh's anger burns against his people, and he has
        stretched out his hand against them, and has struck them.
        The mountains tremble, and their dead bodies are as refuse
        in the midst of the streets.  For all this, his anger is not
        turned away, but his hand is still stretched out.
005:026 He will lift up a banner to the nations from far,
        and he will whistle for them from the end of the earth.
        Behold, they will come speedily and swiftly.
005:027 None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber
        nor sleep; neither shall the belt of their waist be untied,
        nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:
005:028 whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent.  Their horses'
        hoofs will be like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind.
005:029 Their roaring will be like a lioness.  They will roar like
        young lions.  Yes, they shall roar, and seize their prey
        and carry it off, and there will be no one to deliver.
005:030 They will roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea.
        If one looks to the land behold, darkness and distress.
        The light is darkened in its clouds.
006:001 In the year that king Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on
        a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple.
006:002 Above him stood the seraphim.  Each one had six wings.
        With two he covered his face.  With two he covered his feet.
        With two he flew.
006:003 One called to another, and said, "Holy, holy, holy, is Yahweh
        of Armies!  The whole earth is full of his glory!"
006:004 The foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him
        who called, and the house was filled with smoke.
006:005 Then I said, "Woe is me!  For I am undone, because I am a man of
        unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips:
        for my eyes have seen the King, Yahweh of Armies!"
006:006 Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand,
        which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar.
006:007 He touched my mouth with it, and said, "Behold, this has
        touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away,
        and your sin forgiven."
006:008 I heard the Lord's voice, saying, "Whom shall I send,
        and who will go for us?"  Then I said, "Here I am.  Send me!"
006:009 He said, "Go, and tell this people, 'You hear indeed,
        but don't understand; and you see indeed, but don't perceive.'
006:010 Make the heart of this people fat.  Make their ears heavy,
        and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes,
        and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart,
        and turn again, and be healed."
006:011 Then I said, "Lord, how long?"  He answered, "Until cities
        are waste without inhabitant, and houses without man,
        and the land becomes utterly waste,
006:012 And Yahweh has removed men far away, and the forsaken places
        are many in the midst of the land.
006:013 If there is a tenth left in it, that also will in turn be consumed:
        as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remains when they
        are felled; so the holy seed is its stock."
007:001 It happened in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son
        of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria,
        and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to
        Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.
007:002 It was told the house of David, saying, "Syria is allied
        with Ephraim."  His heart trembled, and the heart of his people,
        as the trees of the forest tremble with the wind.
007:003 Then Yahweh said to Isaiah, "Go out now to meet Ahaz,
        you, and Shearjashub your son, at the end of the conduit
        of the upper pool, on the highway of the fuller's field.
007:004 Tell him, 'Be careful, and keep calm.  Don't be afraid,
        neither let your heart be faint because of these two tails
        of smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria,
        and of the son of Remaliah.
007:005 Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have plotted
        evil against you, saying,
007:006 "Let's go up against Judah, and tear it apart, and let's divide
        it among ourselves, and set up a king in the midst of it,
        even the son of Tabeel."
007:007 This is what the Lord Yahweh says:  "It shall not stand,
        neither shall it happen."
007:008 For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin;
        and within sixty-five years Ephraim shall be broken in pieces,
        so that it shall not be a people;
007:009 and the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria
        is Remaliah's son.  If you will not believe, surely you shall
        not be established.'"
007:010 Yahweh spoke again to Ahaz, saying,
007:011 "Ask a sign of Yahweh your God; ask it either in the depth,
        or in the height above."
007:012 But Ahaz said, "I will not ask, neither will I tempt Yahweh."
007:013 He said, "Listen now, house of David:  Is it not enough for you
        to try the patience of men, that you will try the patience
        of my God also?
007:014 Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign.
        Behold, the virgin will conceive, and bear a son, and shall
        call his name Immanuel.{"Immanuel" means "God with us."}
007:015 He shall eat butter and honey when he knows to refuse the evil,
        and choose the good.
007:016 For before the child knows to refuse the evil, and choose the good,
        the land whose two kings you abhor shall be forsaken.
007:017 Yahweh will bring on you, on your people, and on your father's house,
        days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed
        from Judah; even the king of Assyria.
007:018 It will happen in that day that Yahweh will whistle for the fly
        that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt,
        and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.
007:019 They shall come, and shall all rest in the desolate valleys,
        in the clefts of the rocks, on all thorn hedges,
        and on all pastures.
007:020 In that day the Lord will shave with a razor that is hired
        in the parts beyond the River, even with the king of Assyria,
        the head and the hair of the feet; and it shall also
        consume the beard.
007:021 It shall happen in that day that a man shall keep alive a young cow,
        and two sheep;
007:022 and it shall happen, that because of the abundance of milk
        which they shall give he shall eat butter:  for everyone will
        eat butter and honey that is left in the midst of the land.
007:023 It will happen in that day that every place where there
        were a thousand vines at a thousand silver shekels, shall be
        for briers and thorns.
007:024 People will go there with arrows and with bow, because all
        the land will be briers and thorns.
007:025 All the hills that were cultivated with the hoe, you shall
        not come there for fear of briers and thorns; but it shall be
        for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of sheep."
008:001 Yahweh said to me, "Take a large tablet, and write on it with a
        man's pen, 'For Maher Shalal Hash Baz;{"Maher Shalal Hash Baz"
        means "quick to the plunder, swift to the spoil."}'
008:002 and I will take for myself faithful witnesses to testify:
        Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah."
008:003 I went to the prophetess, and she conceived, and bore a son.
        Then said Yahweh to me, "Call his name 'Maher Shalal Hash Baz.'
008:004 For before the child knows how to say, 'My father,' and, 'My mother,'
        the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria will be carried
        away by the king of Assyria."
008:005 Yahweh spoke to me yet again, saying,
008:006 "Because this people have refused the waters of Shiloah
        that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;
008:007 now therefore, behold, the Lord brings upon them the mighty flood
        waters of the River:  the king of Assyria and all his glory.
        It will come up over all its channels, and go over all its banks.
008:008 It will sweep onward into Judah.  It will overflow and pass through;
        it will reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of its
        wings will fill the breadth of your land, Immanuel.
008:009 Make an uproar, you peoples, and be broken in pieces!  Listen, all you
        from far countries:  dress for battle, and be shattered!
        Dress for battle, and be shattered!
008:010 Take counsel together, and it will be brought to nothing;
        speak the word, and it will not stand:  for God is with us."
008:011 For Yahweh spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed
        me not to walk in the way of this people, saying,
008:012 "Don't say, 'A conspiracy!' concerning all about which this
        people say, 'A conspiracy!' neither fear their threats,
        nor be terrorized.
008:013 Yahweh of Armies is who you must regard as holy.
        He is the one you must fear.  He is the one you must dread.
008:014 He will be a sanctuary, but for both houses of Israel,
        he will be a trap and a snare for the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
008:015 Many will stumble over it, fall, be broken, be snared,
        and be captured."
008:016 Wrap up the testimony.  Seal the law among my disciples.
008:017 I will wait for Yahweh, who hides his face from the house of Jacob,
        and I will look for him.
008:018 Behold, I and the children whom Yahweh has given me are
        for signs and for wonders in Israel from Yahweh of Armies,
        who dwells in Mount Zion.
008:019 When they tell you, "Consult with those who have familiar
        spirits and with the wizards, who chirp and who mutter:"
        shouldn't a people consult with their God?  Should they
        consult the dead on behalf of the living?
008:020 Turn to the law and to the testimony!  If they don't speak
        according to this word, surely there is no morning for them.
008:021 They will pass through it, sore distressed and hungry;
        and it will happen that when they are hungry, they will worry,
        and curse by their king and by their God.  They will turn
        their faces upward,
008:022 and look to the earth, and see distress, darkness, and the gloom
        of anguish.  They will be driven into thick darkness.
009:001 But there shall be no more gloom for her who was in anguish.
        In the former time, he brought into contempt the land
        of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali; but in the latter
        time he has made it glorious, by the way of the sea,
        beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.
009:002 The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light.
        Those who lived in the land of the shadow of death, on them
        the light has shined.
009:003 You have multiplied the nation.  You have increased their joy.
        They rejoice before you according to the joy in harvest,
        as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.
009:004 For the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder,
        the rod of his oppressor, you have broken as in the day of Midian.
009:005 For all the armor of the armed man in the noisy battle,
        and the garments rolled in blood, will be for burning,
        fuel for the fire.
009:006 For to us a child is born.  To us a son is given;
        and the government will be on his shoulders.  His name will be
        called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father,
        Prince of Peace.
009:007 Of the increase of his government and of peace there shall
        be no end, on the throne of David, and on his kingdom,
        to establish it, and to uphold it with justice and
        with righteousness from that time on, even forever.
        The zeal of Yahweh of Armies will perform this.
009:008 The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it falls on Israel.
009:009 All the people will know, including Ephraim and the inhabitants
        of Samaria, who say in pride and in arrogance of heart,
009:010 "The bricks have fallen, but we will build with hewn stone.
        The sycamore fig trees have been cut down, but we will put
        cedars in their place."
009:011 Therefore Yahweh will set up on high against him the adversaries
        of Rezin, and will stir up his enemies,
009:012 The Syrians in front, and the Philistines behind; and they
        will devour Israel with open mouth.  For all this, his anger
        is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
009:013 Yet the people have not turned to him who struck them,
        neither have they sought Yahweh of Armies.
009:014 Therefore Yahweh will cut off from Israel head and tail,
        palm branch and reed, in one day.
009:015 The elder and the honorable man is the head, and the prophet
        who teaches lies is the tail.
009:016 For those who lead this people lead them astray; and those
        who are led by them are destroyed.
009:017 Therefore the Lord will not rejoice over their young men,
        neither will he have compassion on their fatherless and widows;
        for everyone is profane and an evil-doer, and every mouth
        speaks folly.  For all this his anger is not turned away,
        but his hand is stretched out still.
009:018 For wickedness burns like a fire.  It devours the briers
        and thorns; yes, it kindles in the thickets of the forest,
        and they roll upward in a column of smoke.
009:019 Through the wrath of Yahweh of Armies, the land is
        burnt up; and the people are the fuel for the fire.
        No one spares his brother.
009:020 One will devour on the right hand, and be hungry; and he will
        eat on the left hand, and they will not be satisfied.
        Everyone will eat the flesh of his own arm:
009:021 Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh; and they together shall
        be against Judah.  For all this his anger is not turned away,
        but his hand is stretched out still.
010:001 Woe to those who decree unrighteous decrees, and to the writers
        who write oppressive decrees;
010:002 to deprive the needy from justice, and to rob the poor among
        my people of their rights, that widows may be their spoil,
        and that they may make the fatherless their prey!
010:003 What will you do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation
        which will come from afar?  To whom will you flee for help?
        Where will you leave your wealth?
010:004 They will only bow down under the prisoners, and will fall
        under the slain.  For all this his anger is not turned away,
        but his hand is stretched out still.
010:005 Alas Assyrian, the rod of my anger, the staff in whose hand
        is my indignation!
010:006 I will send him against a profane nation, and against the people
        who anger me will I give him a charge to take the spoil
        and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire
        of the streets.
010:007 However he doesn't mean so, neither does his heart think so;
        but it is in his heart to destroy, and to cut off not
        a few nations.
010:008 For he says, "Aren't all of my princes kings?
010:009 Isn't Calno like Carchemish?  Isn't Hamath like Arpad?
        Isn't Samaria like Damascus?"
010:010 As my hand has found the kingdoms of the idols, whose engraved
        images exceeded those of Jerusalem and of Samaria;
010:011 shall I not, as I have done to Samaria and her idols,
        so do to Jerusalem and her idols?
010:012 Therefore it will happen that, when the Lord has performed
        his whole work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish
        the fruit of the willful proud heart of the king of Assyria,
        and the insolence of his haughty looks.
010:013 For he has said, "By the strength of my hand I have done it,
        and by my wisdom; for I have understanding:  and I have removed
        the boundaries of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures.
        Like a valiant man I have brought down their rulers.
010:014 My hand has found the riches of the peoples like a nest,
        and like one gathers eggs that are abandoned, have I gathered
        all the earth.  There was no one who moved their wing,
        or that opened their mouth, or chirped."
010:015 Should an axe brag against him who chops with it?
        Should a saw exalt itself above him who saws with it?
        As if a rod should lift those who lift it up, or as if a staff
        should lift up someone who is not wood.
010:016 Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, will send among his fat
        ones leanness; and under his glory a burning will be kindled
        like the burning of fire.
010:017 The light of Israel will be for a fire, and his Holy One
        for a flame; and it will burn and devour his thorns and his
        briers in one day.
010:018 He will consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field,
        both soul and body.  It will be as when a standard bearer faints.
010:019 The remnant of the trees of his forest shall be few,
        so that a child could write their number.
010:020 It will come to pass in that day that the remnant of Israel,
        and those who have escaped from the house of Jacob will no more
        again lean on him who struck them, but shall lean on Yahweh,
        the Holy One of Israel, in truth.
010:021 A remnant will return, even the remnant of Jacob,
        to the mighty God.
010:022 For though your people, Israel, are like the sand of the sea,
        only a remnant of them will return.  A destruction is determined,
        overflowing with righteousness.
010:023 For the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, will make a full end,
        and that determined, in the midst of all the earth.
010:024 Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, says "My people who dwell
        in Zion, don't be afraid of the Assyrian, though he strike
        you with the rod, and lift up his staff against you,
        as Egypt did.
010:025 For yet a very little while, and the indignation against
        you will be accomplished, and my anger will be directed
        to his destruction."
010:026 Yahweh of Armies will stir up a scourge against him,
        as in the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb.
        His rod will be over the sea, and he will lift it up like
        he did against Egypt.
010:027 It will happen in that day, that his burden will depart
        from off your shoulder, and his yoke from off your neck,
        and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing oil.
010:028 He has come to Aiath.  He has passed through Migron.
        At Michmash he stores his baggage.
010:029 They have gone over the pass.  They have taken up their lodging
        at Geba.  Ramah trembles.  Gibeah of Saul has fled.
010:030 Cry aloud with your voice, daughter of Gallim!  Listen, Laishah!
        You poor Anathoth!
010:031 Madmenah is a fugitive.  The inhabitants of Gebim flee for safety.
010:032 This very day he will halt at Nob.  He shakes his hand at
        the mountain of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.
010:033 Behold, the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, will lop the boughs with terror.
        The tall will be cut down, and the lofty will be brought low.
010:034 He will cut down the thickets of the forest with iron,
        and Lebanon will fall by the Mighty One.
011:001 A shoot will come out of the stock of Jesse, and a branch
        out of his roots will bear fruit.
011:002 The Spirit of Yahweh will rest on him:  the spirit of wisdom
        and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit
        of knowledge and of the fear of Yahweh.
011:003 His delight will be in the fear of Yahweh.  He will not judge
        by the sight of his eyes, neither decide by the hearing
        of his ears;
011:004 but with righteousness he will judge the poor, and decide
        with equity for the humble of the earth.  He will strike
        the earth with the rod of his mouth; and with the breath
        of his lips he will kill the wicked.
011:005 Righteousness will be the belt of his waist, and faithfulness
        the belt of his waist.
011:006 The wolf will live with the lamb, and the leopard will lie down
        with the young goat; The calf, the young lion, and the fattened
        calf together; and a little child will lead them.
011:007 The cow and the bear will graze.  Their young ones will lie
        down together.  The lion will eat straw like the ox.
011:008 The nursing child will play near a cobra's hole, and the weaned
        child will put his hand on the viper's den.
011:009 They will not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain;
        for the earth will be full of the knowledge of Yahweh,
        as the waters cover the sea.
011:010 It will happen in that day that the nations will seek
        the root of Jesse, who stands as a banner of the peoples;
        and his resting place will be glorious.
011:011 It will happen in that day that the Lord will set his hand
        again the second time to recover the remnant that is left
        of his people from Assyria, from Egypt, from Pathros, from Cush,
        from Elam, from Shinar, from Hamath, and from the islands
        of the sea.
011:012 He will set up a banner for the nations, and will assemble
        the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed
        of Judah from the four corners of the earth.
011:013 The envy also of Ephraim will depart, and those who persecute
        Judah will be cut off.  Ephraim won't envy Judah, and Judah
        won't persecute Ephraim.
011:014 They will fly down on the shoulders of the Philistines on the west.
        Together they will plunder the children of the east.
        They will extend their power over Edom and Moab, and the children
        of Ammon will obey them.
011:015 Yahweh will utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea;
        and with his scorching wind he will wave his hand over the River,
        and will split it into seven streams, and cause men to march
        over in sandals.
011:016 There will be a highway for the remnant that is left of his
        people from Assyria, like there was for Israel in the day
        that he came up out of the land of Egypt.
012:001 In that day you will say, "I will give thanks to you, Yahweh;
        for though you were angry with me, your anger has turned away
        and you comfort me.
012:002 Behold, God is my salvation.  I will trust, and will not
        be afraid; for Yah, Yahweh, is my strength and song;
        and he has become my salvation."
012:003 Therefore with joy you will draw water out of the wells of salvation.
012:004 In that day you will say, "Give thanks to Yahweh!  Call on his name.
        Declare his doings among the peoples.  Proclaim that his
        name is exalted!
012:005 Sing to Yahweh, for he has done excellent things!
        Let this be known in all the earth!
012:006 Cry aloud and shout, you inhabitant of Zion; for the Holy One
        of Israel is great in the midst of you!"
013:001 The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw:
013:002 Set up a banner on the bare mountain!  Lift up your voice to them!
        Wave your hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.
013:003 I have commanded my consecrated ones; yes, I have called
        my mighty men for my anger, even my proudly exulting ones.
013:004 The noise of a multitude is in the mountains, as of a great people;
        the noise of an uproar of the kingdoms of the nations
        gathered together!  Yahweh of Armies is mustering the army
        for the battle.
013:005 They come from a far country, from the uttermost part of heaven,
        even Yahweh, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy
        the whole land.
013:006 Wail; for the day of Yahweh is at hand!  It will come as
        destruction from the Almighty.
013:007 Therefore all hands will be feeble, and everyone's heart will melt.
013:008 They will be dismayed.  Pangs and sorrows will seize them.
        They will be in pain like a woman in labor.  They will look
        in amazement one at another.  Their faces will be faces of flame.
013:009 Behold, the day of Yahweh comes, cruel, with wrath and fierce anger;
        to make the land a desolation, and to destroy its sinners
        out of it.
013:010 For the stars of the sky and its constellations will not give
        their light.  The sun will be darkened in its going forth,
        and the moon will not cause its light to shine.
013:011 I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked
        for their iniquity.  I will cause the arrogance of the proud
        to cease, and will humble the haughtiness of the terrible.
013:012 I will make people more rare than fine gold, even a person
        than the pure gold of Ophir.
013:013 Therefore I will make the heavens tremble, and the earth will
        be shaken out of its place in the wrath of Yahweh of Armies,
        and in the day of his fierce anger.
013:014 It will happen that like a a hunted gazelle, and like sheep
        that no one gathers, they will each turn to their own people,
        and will each flee to their own land.
013:015 Everyone who is found will be thrust through.  Everyone who is
        captured will fall by the sword.
013:016 Their infants also will be dashed in pieces before their eyes.
        Their houses will be ransacked, and their wives raped.
013:017 Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, who will not
        value silver, and as for gold, they will not delight in it.
013:018 Their bows will dash the young men in pieces;
        and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb.
        Their eyes will not spare children.
013:019 Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldeans'
        pride, will be like when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.
013:020 It will never be inhabited, neither will it be lived in from
        generation to generation.  The Arabian will not pitch a tent there,
        neither will shepherds make their flocks lie down there.
013:021 But wild animals of the desert will lie there, and their
        houses will be full of jackals.  Ostriches will dwell there,
        and wild goats will frolic there.
013:022 Wolves will cry in their castles, and jackals in the
        pleasant palaces.  Her time is near to come, and her days
        will not be prolonged.
014:001 For Yahweh will have compassion on Jacob, and will
        yet choose Israel, and set them in their own land.
        The foreigner will join himself with them, and they will unite
        with the house of Jacob.
014:002 The peoples will take them, and bring them to their place.
        The house of Israel will possess them in Yahweh's land for servants
        and for handmaids.  They will take as captives those whose
        captives they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors.
014:003 It will happen in the day that Yahweh will give you rest from
        your sorrow, from your trouble, and from the hard service
        in which you were made to serve,
014:004 that you will take up this parable against the king
        of Babylon, and say, "How the oppressor has ceased!
        The golden city has ceased!"
014:005 Yahweh has broken the staff of the wicked, the scepter
        of the rulers,
014:006 who struck the peoples in wrath with a continual stroke, who ruled
        the nations in anger, with a persecution that none restrained.
014:007 The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet.  They break out song.
014:008 Yes, the fir trees rejoice with you, with the cedars
        of Lebanon, saying, "Since you are humbled, no lumberjack
        has come up against us."
014:009 Sheol from beneath has moved for you to meet you at your coming.
        It stirs up the dead for you, even all the rulers of the earth.
        It has raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.
014:010 They all will answer and ask you, "Have you also become as weak
        as we are?  Have you become like us?"
014:011 Your pomp is brought down to Sheol, with the sound of your
        stringed instruments.  Maggots are spread out under you,
        and worms cover you.
014:012 How you have fallen from heaven, morning star, son of the dawn!
        How you are cut down to the ground, who laid the nations low!
014:013 You said in your heart, "I will ascend into heaven!
        I will exalt my throne above the stars of God!  I will sit
        on the mountain of assembly, in the far north!
014:014 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds!  I will make
        myself like the Most High!"
014:015 Yet you shall be brought down to Sheol, to the depths of the pit.
014:016 Those who see you will stare at you.  They will ponder you,
        saying, "Is this the man who made the earth to tremble,
        who shook kingdoms;
014:017 who made the world like a wilderness, and overthrew its cities;
        who didn't release his prisoners to their home?"
014:018 All the kings of the nations, sleep in glory, everyone in
        his own house.
014:019 But you are cast away from your tomb like an abominable branch,
        clothed with the slain, who are thrust through with the sword,
        who go down to the stones of the pit; like a dead body
        trodden under foot.
014:020 You will not join them in burial, because you have destroyed
        your land.  You have killed your people.  The seed of evil-doers
        will not be named forever.
014:021 Prepare for slaughter of his children because of the iniquity
        of their fathers, that they not rise up and possess the earth,
        and fill the surface of the world with cities.
014:022 "I will rise up against them," says Yahweh of Armies,
        "and cut off from Babylon name and remnant, and son and
        son's son," says Yahweh.
014:023 "I will also make it a possession for the porcupine, and pools
        of water.  I will sweep it with the broom of destruction,"
        says Yahweh of Armies.
014:024 Yahweh of Armies has sworn, saying, "Surely, as I have thought,
        so shall it happen; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand:
014:025 that I will break the Assyrian in my land, and tread him
        under foot on my mountains.  Then his yoke will leave them,
        and his burden leave their shoulders.
014:026 This is the plan that is determined for the whole earth.
        This is the hand that is stretched out over all the nations.
014:027 For Yahweh of Armies has planned, and who can stop it?
        His hand is stretched out, and who can turn it back?"
014:028 This burden was in the year that king Ahaz died.
014:029 Don't rejoice, O Philistia, all of you, because the rod that
        struck you is broken; for out of the serpent's root an adder
        will emerge, and his fruit will be a fiery flying serpent.
014:030 The firstborn of the poor will eat, and the needy will lie
        down in safety; and I will kill your root with famine,
        and your remnant will be killed.
014:031 Howl, gate!  Cry, city!  You are melted away, Philistia, all of you;
        for smoke comes out of the north, and there is no straggler
        in his ranks.
014:032 What will they answer the messengers of the nation?
        That Yahweh has founded Zion, and in her the afflicted of his
        people will take refuge.
015:001 The burden of Moab:  for in a night, Ar of Moab is laid waste,
        and brought to nothing; for in a night Kir of Moab is laid waste,
        and brought to nothing.
015:002 They have gone up to Bayith, and to Dibon, to the high places,
        to weep.  Moab wails over Nebo and over Medeba.
        Baldness is on all of their heads.  Every beard is cut off.
015:003 In their streets, they dress themselves in sackcloth.
        In their streets and on their housetops, everyone wails,
        weeping abundantly.
015:004 Heshbon cries out with Elealeh.  Their voice is heard even
        to Jahaz.  Therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud.
        Their souls tremble within them.
015:005 My heart cries out for Moab!  Her nobles flee to Zoar,
        to Eglath Shelishiyah; for they go up by the ascent of Luhith
        with weeping; for in the way of Horonaim, they raise up
        a cry of destruction.
015:006 For the waters of Nimrim will be desolate; for the grass has
        withered away, the tender grass fails, there is no green thing.
015:007 Therefore they will carry away the abundance they have gotten,
        and that which they have stored up, over the brook of the willows.
015:008 For the cry has gone around the borders of Moab; its wailing
        to Eglaim, and its wailing to Beer Elim.
015:009 For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; for I will bring
        yet more on Dimon, a lion on those of Moab who escape,
        and on the remnant of the land.
016:001 Send the lambs for the ruler of the land from Selah to the wilderness,
        to the mountain of the daughter of Zion.
016:002 For it will be that as wandering birds, as a scattered nest,
        so will the daughters of Moab be at the fords of the Arnon.
016:003 Give counsel!  Execute justice!  Make your shade like
        the night in the midst of the noonday!  Hide the outcasts!
        Don't betray the fugitive!
016:004 Let my outcasts dwell with you!  As for Moab, be a
        hiding place for him from the face of the destroyer.
        For the extortioner is brought to nothing.  Destruction ceases.
        The oppressors are consumed out of the land.
016:005 A throne will be established in loving kindness.  One will sit
        on it in truth, in the tent of David, judging, seeking justice,
        and swift to do righteousness.
016:006 We have heard of the pride of Moab, that he is very proud;
        even of his arrogance, his pride, and his wrath.
        His boastings are nothing.
016:007 Therefore Moab will wail for Moab.  Everyone will wail.
        You will mourn for the raisin cakes of Kir Hareseth,
        utterly stricken.
016:008 For the fields of Heshbon languish with the vine of Sibmah.
        The lords of the nations have broken down its choice branches,
        which reached even to Jazer, which wandered into the wilderness.
        Its shoots were spread abroad.  They passed over the sea.
016:009 Therefore I will weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vine
        of Sibmah.  I will water you with my tears, Heshbon, and Elealeh:
        for on your summer fruits and on your harvest the battle
        shout has fallen.
016:010 Gladness is taken away, and joy out of the fruitful field;
        and in the vineyards there will be no singing, neither
        joyful noise.  Nobody will tread out wine in the presses.
        I have made the shouting stop.
016:011 Therefore my heart sounds like a harp for Moab, and my inward
        parts for Kir Heres.
016:012 It will happen that when Moab presents himself, when he wearies
        himself on the high place, and comes to his sanctuary to pray,
        that he will not prevail.
016:013 This is the word that Yahweh spoke concerning Moab in time past.
016:014 But now Yahweh has spoken, saying, "Within three years,
        as a worker bound by contract would count them, the glory of Moab
        shall be brought into contempt, with all his great multitude;
        and the remnant will be very small and feeble."
017:001 The burden of Damascus:  "Behold, Damascus is taken away
        from being a city, and it will be a ruinous heap.
017:002 The cities of Aroer are forsaken.  They will be for flocks,
        which shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid.
017:003 The fortress shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom
        from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria.  They will be as
        the glory of the children of Israel," says Yahweh of Armies.
017:004 "It will happen in that day that the glory of Jacob will be
        made thin, and the fatness of his flesh will become lean.
017:005 It will be like when the harvester gathers the wheat, and his
        arm reaps the grain.  Yes, it will be like when one gleans
        grain in the valley of Rephaim.
017:006 Yet gleanings will be left there, like the shaking of an olive tree,
        two or three olives in the top of the uppermost bough,
        four or five in the outermost branches of a fruitful tree,"
        says Yahweh, the God of Israel.
017:007 In that day, people will look to their Maker, and their eyes
        will have respect for the Holy One of Israel.
017:008 They will not look to the altars, the work of their hands;
        neither shall they respect that which their fingers have made,
        either the Asherim, or the incense altars.
017:009 In that day, their strong cities will be like the forsaken places
        in the woods and on the mountain top, which were forsaken from
        before the children of Israel; and it will be a desolation.
017:010 For you have forgotten the God of your salvation, and have not
        remembered the rock of your strength.  Therefore you plant
        pleasant plants, and set out foreign seedlings.
017:011 In the day of your planting, you hedge it in.  In the morning,
        you make your seed blossom, but the harvest flees away
        in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.
017:012 Ah, the uproar of many peoples, who roar like the roaring of the seas;
        and the rushing of nations, that rush like the rushing
        of mighty waters!
017:013 The nations will rush like the rushing of many waters:
        but he will rebuke them, and they will flee far off, and will
        be chased like the chaff of the mountains before the wind,
        and like the whirling dust before the storm.
017:014 At evening, behold, terror!  Before the morning, they are no more.
        This is the portion of those who plunder us, and the lot
        of those who rob us.
018:001 Ah, the land of the rustling of wings, which is beyond
        the rivers of Ethiopia;
018:002 that sends ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of
        papyrus on the waters, saying, "Go, you swift messengers,
        to a nation tall and smooth, to a people awesome from their
        beginning onward, a nation that measures out and treads down,
        whose land the rivers divide!"
018:003 All you inhabitants of the world, and you dwellers on the earth,
        when a banner is lifted up on the mountains, look!
        When the trumpet is blown, listen!
018:004 For Yahweh said to me, "I will be still, and I will see in my
        dwelling place, like clear heat in sunshine, like a cloud
        of dew in the heat of harvest."
018:005 For before the harvest, when the blossom is over,
        and the flower becomes a ripening grape, he will cut off
        the sprigs with pruning hooks, and he will cut down and take
        away the spreading branches.
018:006 They will be left together for the ravenous birds
        of the mountains, and for the animals of the earth.
        The ravenous birds will summer on them, and all the animals
        of the earth will winter on them.
018:007 In that time, a present will be brought to Yahweh of Armies
        from a people tall and smooth, even from a people awesome
        from their beginning onward, a nation that measures out
        and treads down, whose land the rivers divide, to the place
        of the name of Yahweh of Armies, Mount Zion.
019:001 The burden of Egypt:  "Behold, Yahweh rides on a swift cloud,
        and comes to Egypt.  The idols of Egypt will tremble at his presence;
        and the heart of Egypt will melt in its midst.
019:002 I will stir up the Egyptians against the Egyptians, and they
        will fight everyone against his brother, and everyone against
        his neighbor; city against city, and kingdom against kingdom.
019:003 The spirit of Egypt will fail in its midst.  I will destroy
        its counsel.  They will seek the idols, the charmers,
        those who have familiar spirits, and the wizards.
019:004 I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord.
        A fierce king will rule over them," says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.
019:005 The waters will fail from the sea, and the river will be wasted
        and become dry.
019:006 The rivers will become foul.  The streams of Egypt will be
        diminished and dried up.  The reeds and flags will wither away.
019:007 The meadows by the Nile, by the brink of the Nile, and all
        the sown fields of the Nile, will become dry, be driven away,
        and be no more.
019:008 The fishermen will lament, and all those who fish in the Nile
        will mourn, and those who spread nets on the waters will languish.
019:009 Moreover those who work in combed flax, and those who weave
        white cloth, will be confounded.
019:010 The pillars will be broken in pieces.  All those who work
        for hire will be grieved in soul.
019:011 The princes of Zoan are utterly foolish.  The counsel
        of the wisest counselors of Pharaoh has become stupid.
        How do you say to Pharaoh, "I am the son of the wise,
        the son of ancient kings?"
019:012 Where then are your wise men?  Let them tell you now; and let
        them know what Yahweh of Armies has purposed concerning Egypt.
019:013 The princes of Zoan have become fools.  The princes of Memphis
        are deceived.  They have caused Egypt to go astray, who are
        the cornerstone of her tribes.
019:014 Yahweh has mixed a spirit of perverseness in the midst of her;
        and they have caused Egypt to go astray in all of its works,
        like a drunken man staggers in his vomit.
019:015 Neither shall there be for Egypt any work, which head or tail,
        palm branch or rush, may do.
019:016 In that day the Egyptians will be like women.  They will tremble
        and fear because of the shaking of the hand of Yahweh of Armies,
        which he shakes over them.
019:017 The land of Judah will become a terror to Egypt.  Everyone to whom
        mention is made of it will be afraid, because of the plans
        of Yahweh of Armies, which he determines against it.
019:018 In that day, there will be five cities in the land of Egypt that
        speak the language of Canaan, and swear to Yahweh of Armies.
        One will be called "The city of destruction."
019:019 In that day, there will be an altar to Yahweh in the midst
        of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to Yahweh at its border.
019:020 It will be for a sign and for a witness to Yahweh of Armies
        in the land of Egypt; for they will cry to Yahweh because
        of oppressors, and he will send them a savior and a defender,
        and he will deliver them.
019:021 Yahweh will be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians will know Yahweh
        in that day.  Yes, they will worship with sacrifice and offering,
        and will vow a vow to Yahweh, and will perform it.
019:022 Yahweh will strike Egypt, striking and healing.
        They will return to Yahweh, and he will be entreated by them,
        and will heal them.
019:023 In that day there will be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria,
        and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian
        into Assyria; and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians.
019:024 In that day, Israel will be the third with Egypt and with Assyria,
        a blessing in the midst of the earth;
019:025 because Yahweh of Armies has blessed them, saying,
        "Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria the work of my hands,
        and Israel my inheritance."
020:001 In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, when Sargon the king
        of Assyria sent him, and he fought against Ashdod and took it;
020:002 at that time Yahweh spoke by Isaiah the son of Amoz,
        saying, "Go, and loosen the sackcloth from off your waist,
        and take your shoes from off your feet."  He did so,
        walking naked and barefoot.
020:003 Yahweh said, "As my servant Isaiah has walked naked and
        barefoot three years for a sign and a wonder concerning Egypt
        and concerning Ethiopia,
020:004 so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt
        and the exiles of Ethiopia, young and old, naked and barefoot,
        and with buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.
020:005 They will be dismayed and confounded, because of Ethiopia
        their expectation, and of Egypt their glory.
020:006 The inhabitants of this coast land will say in that day, 'Behold,
        this is our expectation, where we fled for help to be delivered
        from the king of Assyria.  And we, how will we escape?'"
021:001 The burden of the wilderness of the sea.  As whirlwinds
        in the South sweep through, it comes from the wilderness,
        from an awesome land.
021:002 A grievous vision is declared to me.  The treacherous
        man deals treacherously, and the destroyer destroys.
        Go up, Elam; attack!  I have stopped all of Media's sighing.
021:003 Therefore my thighs are filled with anguish.  Pains have
        taken hold on me, like the pains of a woman in labor.
        I am in so much pain that I can't hear.  I so am dismayed
        that I can't see.
021:004 My heart flutters.  Horror has frightened me.  The twilight
        that I desired has been turned into trembling for me.
021:005 They prepare the table.  They set the watch.  They eat.
        They drink.  Rise up, you princes, oil the shield!
021:006 For the Lord said to me, "Go, set a watchman.  Let him declare
        what he sees.
021:007 When he sees a troop, horsemen in pairs, a troop of donkeys, a troop
        of camels, he shall listen diligently with great attentiveness."
021:008 He cried like a lion:  "Lord, I stand continually on the watchtower
        in the daytime, and every night I stay at my post.
021:009 Behold, here comes a troop of men, horsemen in pairs."
        He answered, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the engraved
        images of her gods are broken to the ground.
021:010 You are my threshing, and the grain of my floor!"
        That which I have heard from Yahweh of Armies, the God
        of Israel, I have declared to you.
021:011 The burden of Dumah.  One calls to me out of Seir, "Watchman,
        what of the night?  Watchman, what of the night?"
021:012 The watchman said, "The morning comes, and also the night.
        If you will inquire, inquire.  Come back again."
021:013 The burden on Arabia.  In the forest in Arabia you will lodge,
        you caravans of Dedanites.
021:014 They brought water to him who was thirsty.  The inhabitants
        of the land of Tema met the fugitives with their bread.
021:015 For they fled away from the swords, from the drawn sword,
        from the bent bow, and from the heat of battle.
021:016 For the Lord said to me, "Within a year, as a worker bound
        by contract would count it, all the glory of Kedar will fail,
021:017 and the residue of the number of the archers, the mighty
        men of the children of Kedar, will be few; for Yahweh,
        the God of Israel, has spoken it."
022:001 The burden of the valley of vision.  What ails you now,
        that you have all gone up to the housetops?
022:002 You that are full of shouting, a tumultuous city, a joyous town;
        your slain are not slain with the sword, neither are they
        dead in battle.
022:003 All your rulers fled away together.  They were bound by
        the archers.  All who were found by you were bound together.
        They fled far away.
022:004 Therefore I said, "Look away from me.  I will weep bitterly.
        Don't labor to comfort me for the destruction of the daughter
        of my people.
022:005 For it is a day of confusion, and of treading down, and of perplexity,
        from the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, in the valley of vision;
        a breaking down of the walls, and a crying to the mountains."
022:006 Elam carried his quiver, with chariots of men and horsemen;
        and Kir uncovered the shield.
022:007 It happened that your choicest valleys were full of chariots,
        and the horsemen set themselves in array at the gate.
022:008 He took away the covering of Judah; and you looked in that day
        to the armor in the house of the forest.
022:009 You saw the breaches of the city of David, that they were many;
        and you gathered together the waters of the lower pool.
022:010 You numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and you broke down
        the houses to fortify the wall.
022:011 You also made a reservoir between the two walls for the water
        of the old pool.  But you didn't look to him who had done this,
        neither did you have respect for him who purposed it long ago.
022:012 In that day, the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, called to weeping,
        and to mourning, and to baldness, and to dressing in sackcloth:
022:013 and behold, joy and gladness, killing oxen and killing sheep,
        eating flesh and drinking wine:  "Let us eat and drink,
        for tomorrow we will die."
022:014 Yahweh of Armies revealed himself in my ears, "Surely this
        iniquity will not be forgiven you until you die,"
        says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.
022:015 Thus says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, "Go, get yourself to
        this treasurer, even to Shebna, who is over the house, and say,
022:016 'What are you doing here?  Who has you here, that you have
        dug out a tomb here?'  Cutting himself out a tomb on high,
        chiseling a habitation for himself in the rock!"
022:017 Behold, Yahweh will overcome you and hurl you away violently.
        Yes, he will grasp you firmly.
022:018 He will surely wind you around and around, and throw you
        like a ball into a large country.  There you will die,
        and there the chariots of your glory will be, you shame
        of your lord's house.
022:019 I will thrust you from your office.  You will be pulled down
        from your station.
022:020 It will happen in that day that I will call my servant Eliakim
        the son of Hilkiah,
022:021 and I will clothe him with your robe, and strengthen him
        with your belt.  I will commit your government into his hand;
        and he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
        and to the house of Judah.
022:022 I will lay the key of the house of David on his shoulder.
        He will open, and no one will shut.  He will shut, and no
        one will open.
022:023 I will fasten him like a nail in a sure place.
        He will be for a throne of glory to his father's house.
022:024 They will hang on him all the glory of his father's house,
        the offspring and the issue, every small vessel, from the cups
        even to all the pitchers.
022:025 "In that day," says Yahweh of Armies, "the nail that was fastened
        in a sure place will give way.  It will be cut down, and fall.
        The burden that was on it will be cut off, for Yahweh
        has spoken it."
023:001 The burden of Tyre.  Howl, you ships of Tarshish!  For it
        is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in.
        From the land of Kittim it is revealed to them.
023:002 Be still, you inhabitants of the coast, you whom the merchants
        of Sidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished.
023:003 On great waters, the seed of the Shihor, the harvest of the Nile,
        was her revenue.  She was the market of nations.
023:004 Be ashamed, Sidon; for the sea has spoken, the stronghold
        of the sea, saying, "I have not travailed, nor brought forth,
        neither have I nourished young men, nor brought up virgins."
023:005 When the report comes to Egypt, they will be in anguish at
        the report of Tyre.
023:006 Pass over to Tarshish!  Wail, you inhabitants of the coast!
023:007 Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days,
        whose feet carried her far away to travel?
023:008 Who has planned this against Tyre, the giver of crowns,
        whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the honorable
        of the earth?
023:009 Yahweh of Armies has planned it, to stain the pride of all glory,
        to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth.
023:010 Pass through your land like the Nile, daughter of Tarshish.
        There is no restraint any more.
023:011 He has stretched out his hand over the sea.  He has
        shaken the kingdoms.  Yahweh has ordered the destruction
        of Canaan's strongholds.
023:012 He said, "You shall rejoice no more, you oppressed
        virgin daughter of Sidon.  Arise, pass over to Kittim.
        Even there you will have no rest."
023:013 Behold, the land of the Chaldeans.  This people was not.
        The Assyrians founded it for those who dwell in the wilderness.
        They set up their towers.  They overthrew its palaces.
        They made it a ruin.
023:014 Howl, you ships of Tarshish, for your stronghold is laid waste!
023:015 It will come to pass in that day that Tyre will be forgotten
        seventy years, according to the days of one king.
        After the end of seventy years it will be to Tyre like in
        the song of the prostitute.
023:016 Take a harp; go about the city, you prostitute that has
        been forgotten.  Make sweet melody.  Sing many songs,
        that you may be remembered.
023:017 It will happen after the end of seventy years that Yahweh
        will visit Tyre, and she shall return to her wages,
        and will play the prostitute with all the kingdoms of the world
        on the surface of the earth.
023:018 Her merchandise and her wages will be holiness to Yahweh.
        It will not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise
        will be for those who dwell before Yahweh, to eat sufficiently,
        and for durable clothing.
024:001 Behold, Yahweh makes the earth empty, makes it waste,
        turns it upside down, and scatters its inhabitants.
024:002 It will be as with the people, so with the priest;
        as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid,
        so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller;
        as with the creditor, so with the debtor; as with the taker
        of interest, so with the giver of interest.
024:003 The earth will be utterly emptied and utterly laid waste;
        for Yahweh has spoken this word.
024:004 The earth mourns and fades away.  The world languishes and
        fades away.  The lofty people of the earth languish.
024:005 The earth also is polluted under its inhabitants, because they
        have transgressed the laws, violated the statutes, and broken
        the everlasting covenant.
024:006 Therefore the curse has devoured the earth, and those who
        dwell therein are found guilty.  Therefore the inhabitants
        of the earth are burned, and few men left.
024:007 The new wine mourns.  The vine languishes.
        All the merry-hearted sigh.
024:008 The mirth of tambourines ceases.  The sound of those who
        rejoice ends.  The joy of the harp ceases.
024:009 They will not drink wine with a song.  Strong drink will be
        bitter to those who drink it.
024:010 The confused city is broken down.  Every house is shut up,
        that no man may come in.
024:011 There is a crying in the streets because of the wine.
        All joy is darkened.  The mirth of the land is gone.
024:012 The city is left in desolation, and the gate is
        struck with destruction.
024:013 For it will be so in the midst of the earth among the peoples,
        as the shaking of an olive tree, as the gleanings when
        the vintage is done.
024:014 These shall lift up their voice.  They will shout for the majesty
        of Yahweh.  They cry aloud from the sea.
024:015 Therefore glorify Yahweh in the east, even the name of Yahweh,
        the God of Israel, in the islands of the sea!
024:016 From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs.
        Glory to the righteous!  But I said, "I pine away!
        I pine away! woe is me!"  The treacherous have dealt treacherously.
        Yes, the treacherous have dealt very treacherously.
024:017 Fear, the pit, and the snare, are on you who inhabitant the earth.
024:018 It will happen that he who flees from the noise of the fear
        will fall into the pit; and he who comes up out of the midst
        of the pit will be taken in the snare; for the windows on high
        are opened, and the foundations of the earth tremble.
024:019 The earth is utterly broken.  The earth is torn apart.
        The earth is shaken violently.
024:020 The earth will stagger like a drunken man, and will sway back
        and forth like a hammock.  Its disobedience will be heavy on it,
        and it will fall and not rise again.
024:021 It shall happen in that day that Yahweh will punish the army
        of the high ones on high, and the kings of the earth
        on the earth.
024:022 They shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered
        in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison; and after
        many days shall they be visited.
024:023 Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed;
        for Yahweh of Armies will reign on Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem;
        and before his elders will be glory.
025:001 Yahweh, you are my God.  I will exalt you!  I will praise your name,
        for you have done wonderful things, things planned long ago,
        in complete faithfulness and truth.
025:002 For you have made a city into a heap, a fortified city
        into a ruin, a palace of strangers to be no city.
        It will never be built.
025:003 Therefore a strong people will glorify you.  A city of awesome
        nations will fear you.
025:004 For you have been a stronghold to the poor, a stronghold
        to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm,
        a shade from the heat, when the blast of the dreaded ones
        is like a storm against the wall.
025:005 As the heat in a dry place will you bring down the noise
        of strangers; as the heat by the shade of a cloud, the song
        of the dreaded ones will be brought low.
025:006 In this mountain, Yahweh of Armies will make all peoples a feast
        of fat things, a feast of choice wines, of fat things full
        of marrow, of well refined choice wines.
025:007 He will destroy in this mountain the surface of the covering
        that covers all peoples, and the veil that is spread
        over all nations.
025:008 He has swallowed up death forever!  The Lord Yahweh will wipe
        away tears from off all faces.  He will take the reproach
        of his people away from off all the earth, for Yahweh
        has spoken it.
025:009 It shall be said in that day, "Behold, this is our God!  We have
        waited for him, and he will save us!  This is Yahweh!  We have
        waited for him.  We will be glad and rejoice in his salvation!"
025:010 For in this mountain the hand of Yahweh will rest.
        Moab will be trodden down in his place, even like straw
        is trodden down in the water of the dunghill.
025:011 He will spread out his hands in its midst, like one who swims
        spreads out hands to swim, but his pride will be humbled
        together with the craft of his hands.
025:012 He has brought the high fortress of your walls down, laid low,
        and brought to the ground, even to the dust.
026:001 In that day, this song will be sung in the land of Judah:  "We have
        a strong city.  God appoints salvation for walls and bulwarks.
026:002 Open the gates, that the righteous nation may enter:
        the one which keeps faith.
026:003 You will keep whoever's mind is steadfast in perfect peace,
        because he trusts in you.
026:004 Trust in Yahweh forever; for in Yah, Yahweh, is an everlasting Rock.
026:005 For he has brought down those who dwell on high, the lofty city.
        He lays it low.  He lays it low even to the ground.
        He brings it even to the dust.
026:006 The foot shall tread it down; Even the feet of the poor,
        and the steps of the needy."
026:007 The way of the just is uprightness.  You who are upright make
        the path of the righteous level.
026:008 Yes, in the way of your judgments, Yahweh, have we waited for you.
        Your name and your renown are the desire of our soul.
026:009 With my soul have I desired you in the night.
        Yes, with my spirit within me will I seek you earnestly;
        for when your judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants
        of the world learn righteousness.
026:010 Let favor be shown to the wicked, yet he will not
        learn righteousness.  In the land of uprightness he will
        deal wrongfully, and will not see Yahweh's majesty.
026:011 Yahweh, your hand is lifted up, yet they don't see; but they
        will see your zeal for the people, and be disappointed.
        Yes, fire will consume your adversaries.
026:012 Yahweh, you will ordain peace for us, for you have also worked
        all our works for us.
026:013 Yahweh our God, other lords besides you have had dominion over us,
        but by you only will we make mention of your name.
026:014 The dead shall not live.  The deceased shall not rise.
        Therefore have you visited and destroyed them, and caused
        all memory of them to perish.
026:015 You have increased the nation, O Yahweh.  You have increased
        the nation!  You are glorified!  You have enlarged all
        the borders of the land.
026:016 Yahweh, in trouble they have visited you.  They poured out
        a prayer when your chastening was on them.
026:017 Like as a woman with child, who draws near the time
        of her delivery, is in pain and cries out in her pangs;
        so we have been before you, Yahweh.
026:018 We have been with child.  We have been in pain.  We gave birth,
        it seems, only to wind.  We have not worked any deliverance
        in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.
026:019 Your dead shall live.  My dead bodies shall arise.
        Awake and sing, you who dwell in the dust; for your dew is
        like the dew of herbs, and the earth will cast forth the dead.
026:020 Come, my people, enter into your chambers, and shut your
        doors behind you.  Hide yourself for a little moment,
        until the indignation is past.
026:021 For, behold, Yahweh comes forth out of his place to punish
        the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity.
        The earth also will disclose her blood, and will no longer
        cover her slain.
027:001 In that day, Yahweh with his hard and great and strong sword
        will punish leviathan, the fleeing serpent, and leviathan
        the twisted serpent; and he will kill the dragon that is
        in the sea.
027:002 In that day, sing to her, "A pleasant vineyard!
027:003 I, Yahweh, am its keeper.  I will water it every moment.
        Lest anyone damage it, I will keep it night and day.
027:004 Wrath is not in me, but if I should find briers and thorns,
        I would do battle!  I would march on them and I would
        burn them together.
027:005 Or else let him take hold of my strength, that he may make
        peace with me.  Let him make peace with me."
027:006 In days to come, Jacob will take root.  Israel will blossom and bud.
        They will fill the surface of the world with fruit.
027:007 Has he struck them as he struck those who struck them?
        Or are they killed like those who killed them were killed?
027:008 In measure, when you send them away, you contend with them.
        He has removed them with his rough blast in the day of
        the east wind.
027:009 Therefore, by this the iniquity of Jacob will be forgiven,
        and this is all the fruit of taking away his sin:
        that he makes all the stones of the altar as chalk stones
        that are beaten in pieces, so that the Asherim and the incense
        altars shall rise no more.
027:010 For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation deserted
        and forsaken, like the wilderness.  The calf will feed there,
        and there he will lie down, and consume its branches.
027:011 When its boughs are withered, they will be broken off.
        The women will come and set them on fire, for they are a people
        of no understanding.  Therefore he who made them will not
        have compassion on them, and he who formed them will show
        them no favor.
027:012 It will happen in that day, that Yahweh will thresh from
        the flowing stream of the Euphrates to the brook of Egypt;
        and you will be gathered one by one, children of Israel.
027:013 It will happen in that day that a great trumpet will be blown;
        and those who were ready to perish in the land of Assyria,
        and those who were outcasts in the land of Egypt, shall come;
        and they will worship Yahweh in the holy mountain at Jerusalem.
028:001 Woe to the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim, and to
        the fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head
        of the fertile valley of those who are overcome with wine!
028:002 Behold, the Lord has a mighty and strong one.  Like a storm of hail,
        a destroying storm, and like a storm of mighty waters overflowing,
        he will cast them down to the earth with his hand.
028:003 The crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim will be
        trodden under foot.
028:004 The fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head
        of the fertile valley, shall be like the first-ripe fig
        before the summer; which someone picks and eats as soon
        as he sees it.
028:005 In that day, Yahweh of Armies will become a crown of glory,
        and a diadem of beauty, to the residue of his people;
028:006 and a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment,
        and strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate.
028:007 They also reel with wine, and stagger with strong drink.
        The priest and the prophet reel with strong drink.
        They are swallowed up by wine.  They stagger with strong drink.
        They err in vision.  They stumble in judgment.
028:008 For all tables are completely full of filthy vomit and filthiness.
028:009 Whom will he teach knowledge?  To whom will he explain the message?
        Those who are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts?
028:010 For it is precept on precept, precept on precept; line on line,
        line on line; here a little, there a little.
028:011 But he will speak to this nation with stammering lips and
        in another language;
028:012 to whom he said, "This is the resting place.  Give rest to weary;"
        and "This is the refreshing;" yet they would not hear.
028:013 Therefore the word of Yahweh will be to them precept on precept,
        precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little,
        there a little; that they may go, fall backward, be broken,
        be snared, and be taken.
028:014 Therefore hear the word of Yahweh, you scoffers, that rule
        this people in Jerusalem:
028:015 "Because you have said, 'We have made a covenant with death,
        and with Sheol are we in agreement.  When the overflowing scourge
        passes through, it won't come to us; for we have made lies
        our refuge, and we have hidden ourselves under falsehood.'"
028:016 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh, "Behold, I lay in Zion
        for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone
        of a sure foundation.  He who believes shall not act hastily.
028:017 I will make justice the measuring line, and righteousness
        the plumb line.  The hail will sweep away the refuge of lies,
        and the waters will overflow the hiding place.
028:018 Your covenant with death shall be annulled, and your agreement
        with Sheol shall not stand.  When the overflowing scourge
        passes through, then you will be trampled down by it.
028:019 As often as it passes through, it will seize you; for morning
        by morning it will pass through, by day and by night;
        and it will be nothing but terror to understand the message."
028:020 For the bed is too short to stretch out on, and the blanket
        is too narrow to wrap oneself in.
028:021 For Yahweh will rise up as on Mount Perazim.
        He will be angry as in the valley of Gibeon; that he may
        do his work, his unusual work, and bring to pass his act,
        his extraordinary act.
028:022 Now therefore don't be scoffers, lest your bonds be made strong;
        for I have heard a decree of destruction from the Lord, Yahweh
        of Armies, on the whole earth.
028:023 Give ear, and hear my voice!  Listen, and hear my speech!
028:024 Does he who plows to sow plow continually?  Does he keep
        turning the soil and breaking the clods?
028:025 When he has leveled its surface, doesn't he plant the dill,
        and scatter the cumin seed, and put in the wheat in rows,
        the barley in the appointed place, and the spelt in its place?
028:026 For his God instructs him in right judgment, and teaches him.
028:027 For the dill are not threshed with a sharp instrument,
        neither is a cart wheel turned over the cumin; but the dill
        is beaten out with a stick, and the cumin with a rod.
028:028 Bread flour must be ground; so he will not always be threshing it.
        Although he drives the wheel of his threshing cart over it,
        his horses don't grind it.
028:029 This also comes forth from Yahweh of Armies, who is wonderful
        in counsel, and excellent in wisdom.
029:001 Woe to Ariel!  Ariel, the city where David encamped!
        Add year to year; let the feasts come around;
029:002 then I will distress Ariel, and there will be mourning
        and lamentation.  She shall be to me as an altar hearth{or, Ariel}.
029:003 I will encamp against you all around you, and will lay
        siege against you with posted troops.  I will raise siege
        works against you.
029:004 You will be brought down, and will speak out of the ground.
        Your speech will mumble out of the dust.  Your voice will
        be as of one who has a familiar spirit, out of the ground,
        and your speech will whisper out of the dust.
029:005 But the multitude of your foes will be like fine dust,
        and the multitude of the ruthless ones like chaff that blows away.
        Yes, it will be in an instant, suddenly.
029:006 She will be visited by Yahweh of Armies with thunder,
        with earthquake, with great noise, with whirlwind and storm,
        and with the flame of a devouring fire.
029:007 The multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel,
        even all who fight against her and her stronghold, and who
        distress her, will be like a dream, a vision of the night.
029:008 It will be like when a hungry man dreams, and behold,
        he eats; but he awakes, and his hunger isn't satisfied;
        or like when a thirsty man dreams, and behold, he drinks;
        but he awakes, and behold, he is faint, and he is still thirsty.
        The multitude of all the nations that fight against Mount Zion
        will be like that.
029:009 Pause and wonder!  Blind yourselves and be blind!
        They are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not
        with strong drink.
029:010 For Yahweh has poured out on you a spirit of deep sleep,
        and has closed your eyes, the prophets; and he has covered
        your heads, the seers.
029:011 All vision has become to you like the words of a book that
        is sealed, which men deliver to one who is educated, saying,
        "Read this, please;" and he says, "I can't, for it is sealed:"
029:012 and the book is delivered to one who is not educated, saying,
        "Read this, please;" and he says, "I can't read."
029:013 The Lord said, "Because this people draws near with their mouth
        and with their lips to honor me, but they have removed their
        heart far from me, and their fear of me is a commandment
        of men which has been taught;
029:014 therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work
        among this people, even a marvelous work and a wonder;
        and the wisdom of their wise men will perish, and the understanding
        of their prudent men will be hidden."
029:015 Woe to those who deeply hide their counsel from Yahweh,
        and whose works are in the dark, and who say, "Who sees us?"
        and "Who knows us?"
029:016 You turn things upside down!  Should the potter be thought
        to be like clay; that the thing made should say about him
        who made it, "He didn't make me;" or the thing formed say
        of him who formed it, "He has no understanding?"
029:017 Isn't it yet a very little while, and Lebanon will be turned
        into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field will be regarded
        as a forest?
029:018 In that day, the deaf will hear the words of the book,
        and the eyes of the blind will see out of obscurity and
        out of darkness.
029:019 The humble also will increase their joy in Yahweh, and the poor
        among men will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
029:020 For the ruthless is brought to nothing, and the scoffer ceases,
        and all those who are alert to do evil are cut off--
029:021 who cause a person to be indicted by a word, and lay a snare
        for the arbiter in the gate, and who deprive the innocent
        of justice with false testimony.
029:022 Therefore thus says Yahweh, who redeemed Abraham, concerning
        the house of Jacob:  "Jacob shall no longer be ashamed,
        neither shall his face grow pale.
029:023 But when he sees his children, the work of my hands,
        in the midst of him, they will sanctify my name.
        Yes, they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and will stand
        in awe of the God of Israel.
029:024 They also who err in spirit will come to understanding,
        and those who grumble will receive instruction."
030:001 "Woe to the rebellious children," says Yahweh, "who take counsel,
        but not from me; and who make an alliance, but not with my Spirit,
        that they may add sin to sin,
030:002 who set out to go down into Egypt, and have not asked my advice;
        to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh,
        and to take refuge in the shadow of Egypt!
030:003 Therefore the strength of Pharaoh will be your shame,
        and the refuge in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.
030:004 For their princes are at Zoan, and their ambassadors have
        come to Hanes.
030:005 They shall all be ashamed because of a people that can't
        profit them, that are not a help nor profit, but a shame,
        and also a reproach."
030:006 The burden of the animals of the South.  Through the land
        of trouble and anguish, of the lioness and the lion, the viper
        and fiery flying serpent, they carry their riches on the shoulders
        of young donkeys, and their treasures on the humps of camels,
        to an unprofitable people.
030:007 For Egypt helps in vain, and to no purpose; therefore have I
        called her Rahab who sits still.
030:008 Now go, write it before them on a tablet, and inscribe it in a book,
        that it may be for the time to come forever and ever.
030:009 For it is a rebellious people, lying children, children who
        will not hear the law of Yahweh;
030:010 who tell the seers, "Don't see!" and to the prophets,
        "Don't prophesy to us right things.  Tell us pleasant things.
        Prophesy deceits.
030:011 Get out of the way.  Turn aside from the path.
        Cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us."
030:012 Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel, "Because you
        despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness,
        and rely on it;
030:013 therefore this iniquity shall be to you like a breach ready
        to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking comes
        suddenly in an instant.
030:014 He will break it as a potter's vessel is broken, breaking it
        in pieces without sparing, so that there won't be found among
        the broken piece a piece good enough to take fire from the hearth,
        or to dip up water out of the cistern."
030:015 For thus said the Lord Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel, "You will
        be saved in returning and rest.  Your strength will be in
        quietness and in confidence."  You refused,
030:016 but you said, "No, for we will flee on horses;"
        therefore you will flee; and, "We will ride on the swift;"
        therefore those who pursue you will be swift.
030:017 One thousand will flee at the threat of one.  At the threat
        of five, you will flee until you are left like a beacon
        on the top of a mountain, and like a banner on a hill.
030:018 Therefore Yahweh will wait, that he may be gracious to you;
        and therefore he will be exalted, that he may have mercy on you,
        for Yahweh is a God of justice.  Blessed are all those who
        wait for him.
030:019 For the people will dwell in Zion at Jerusalem.  You will weep
        no more.  He will surely be gracious to you at the voice
        of your cry.  When he hears you, he will answer you.
030:020 Though the Lord may give you the bread of adversity and the water
        of affliction, yet your teachers won't be hidden anymore,
        but your eyes will see your teachers;
030:021 and when you turn to the right hand, and when you turn to the left,
        your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying, "This is the way.
        Walk in it."
030:022 You shall defile the overlaying of your engraved images
        of silver, and the plating of your molten images of gold.
        You shall cast them away as an unclean thing.  You shall
        tell it, "Go away!"
030:023 He will give the rain for your seed, with which you will sow
        the ground; and bread of the increase of the ground will be
        rich and plentiful.  In that day, your livestock will feed
        in large pastures.
030:024 The oxen likewise and the young donkeys that till the ground will
        eat savory provender, which has been winnowed with the shovel
        and with the fork.
030:025 There shall be brooks and streams of water on every lofty mountain
        and on every high hill in the day of the great slaughter,
        when the towers fall.
030:026 Moreover the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun,
        and the light of the sun will be seven times brighter,
        like the light of seven days, in the day that Yahweh binds
        up the fracture of his people, and heals the wound they
        were struck with.
030:027 Behold, the name of Yahweh comes from far away, burning with
        his anger, and in thick rising smoke.  His lips are full
        of indignation, and his tongue is as a devouring fire.
030:028 His breath is as an overflowing stream that reaches even to
        the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction;
        and a bridle that leads to ruin will be in the jaws
        of the peoples.
030:029 You will have a song, as in the night when a holy feast is kept;
        and gladness of heart, as when one goes with a flute to come
        to Yahweh's mountain, to Israel's Rock.
030:030 Yahweh will cause his glorious voice to be heard, and will show
        the descent of his arm, with the indignation of his anger,
        and the flame of a devouring fire, with a blast,
        storm, and hailstones.
030:031 For through the voice of Yahweh the Assyrian will be dismayed.
        He will strike him with his rod.
030:032 Every stroke of the rod of punishment, which Yahweh will lay
        on him, will be with the sound of tambourines and harps.
        He will fight with them in battles, brandishing weapons.
030:033 For his burning place has long been ready.  Yes, for the king
        it is made ready.  He has made its pyre deep and large
        with fire and much wood.  Yahweh's breath, like a stream
        of sulfur, kindles it.
031:001 Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help, and rely on horses,
        and trust in chariots because they are many, and in horsemen
        because they are very strong, but they don't look to the Holy One
        of Israel, and they don't seek Yahweh!
031:002 Yet he also is wise, and will bring disaster, and will not call back
        his words, but will arise against the house of the evil-doers,
        and against the help of those who work iniquity.
031:003 Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh,
        and not spirit.  When Yahweh stretches out his hand,
        both he who helps shall stumble, and he who is helped shall fall,
        and they all shall be consumed together.
031:004 For thus says Yahweh to me, "As the lion and the young lion
        growling over his prey, if a multitude of shepherds is called
        together against him, will not be dismayed at their voice,
        nor abase himself for the noise of them, so Yahweh of Armies
        will come down to fight on Mount Zion and on its heights.
031:005 As birds hovering, so Yahweh of Armies will protect Jerusalem.
        He will protect and deliver it.  He will pass over
        and preserve it."
031:006 Return to him from whom you have deeply revolted,
        children of Israel.
031:007 For in that day everyone shall cast away his idols of silver and
        his idols of gold--sin which your own hands have made for you.
031:008 "The Assyrian will fall by the sword, not of man; and the sword,
        not of mankind, shall devour him.  He will flee from the sword,
        and his young men will become subject to forced labor.
031:009 His rock will pass away by reason of terror, and his princes will
        be afraid of the banner," says Yahweh, whose fire is in Zion,
        and his furnace in Jerusalem.
032:001 Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall
        rule in justice.
032:002 A man shall be as a hiding place from the wind, and a covert
        from the storm, as streams of water in a dry place,
        as the shade of a large rock in a weary land.
032:003 The eyes of those who see will not be dim, and the ears
        of those who hear will listen.
032:004 The heart of the rash will understand knowledge, and the tongue
        of the stammerers will be ready to speak plainly.
032:005 The fool will no longer be called noble, nor the scoundrel
        be highly respected.
032:006 For the fool will speak folly, and his heart will work iniquity,
        to practice profanity, and to utter error against Yahweh, To make
        empty the soul of the hungry, and to cause the drink of
        the thirsty to fail.
032:007 The ways of the scoundrel are evil.  He devises wicked
        devices to destroy the humble with lying words, even when
        the needy speaks right.
032:008 But the noble devises noble things; and he will continue
        in noble things.
032:009 Rise up, you women who are at ease!  Hear my voice!
        You careless daughters, give ear to my speech!
032:010 For days beyond a year you will be troubled, you careless women;
        for the vintage shall fail.  The harvest won't come.
032:011 Tremble, you women who are at ease!  Be troubled, you careless ones!
        Strip yourselves, make yourselves naked, and put sackcloth
        on your waist.
032:012 Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.
032:013 Thorns and briars will come up on my people's land; yes, on all
        the houses of joy in the joyous city.
032:014 For the palace will be forsaken.  The populous city will be deserted.
        The hill and the watchtower will be for dens forever,
        a delight for wild donkeys, a pasture of flocks;
032:015 Until the Spirit is poured on us from on high, and the
        wilderness becomes a fruitful field, and the fruitful field
        is considered a forest.
032:016 Then justice will dwell in the wilderness; and righteousness
        will remain in the fruitful field.
032:017 The work of righteousness will be peace; and the effect
        of righteousness, quietness and confidence forever.
032:018 My people will abide in a peaceful habitation, in safe dwellings,
        and in quiet resting places.
032:019 Though hail flattens the forest, and the city is leveled completely.
032:020 Blessed are you who sow beside all waters, who send out the feet
        of the ox and the donkey.
033:001 Woe to you who destroy, but you weren't destroyed; and who betray,
        but nobody betrayed you!  When you have finished destroying,
        you will be destroyed; and when you have made an end of betrayal,
        you will be betrayed.
033:002 Yahweh, be gracious to us.  We have waited for you.
        Be our strength every morning, our salvation also in the
        time of trouble.
033:003 At the noise of the thunder, the peoples have fled.
        When you lift yourself up, the nations are scattered.
033:004 Your spoil will be gathered as the caterpillar gathers.
        Men will leap on it as locusts leap.
033:005 Yahweh is exalted, for he dwells on high.  He has filled Zion
        with justice and righteousness.
033:006 There will be stability in your times, abundance of salvation,
        wisdom, and knowledge.  The fear of Yahweh is your treasure.
033:007 Behold, their valiant ones cry outside; the ambassadors
        of peace weep bitterly.
033:008 The highways are desolate.  The traveling man ceases.
        The covenant is broken.  He has despised the cities.
        He doesn't regard man.
033:009 The land mourns and languishes.  Lebanon is confounded and
        withers away.  Sharon is like a desert, and Bashan and Carmel
        are stripped bare.
033:010 "Now I will arise," says Yahweh; "Now I will lift myself up.
        Now I will be exalted.
033:011 You will conceive chaff.  You will bring forth stubble.
        Your breath is a fire that will devour you.
033:012 The peoples will be like the burning of lime, like thorns
        that are cut down and burned in the fire.
033:013 Hear, you who are far off, what I have done; and, you who are near,
        acknowledge my might."
033:014 The sinners in Zion are afraid.  Trembling has seized the
        godless ones.  Who among us can live with the devouring fire?
        Who among us can live with everlasting burning?
033:015 He who walks righteously, and speaks blamelessly; He who
        despises the gain of oppressions, who gestures with his hands,
        refusing to take a bribe, who stops his ears from hearing
        of blood, and shuts his eyes from looking at evil--
033:016 he will dwell on high.  His place of defense will be
        the fortress of rocks.  His bread will be supplied.
        His waters will be sure.
033:017 Your eyes will see the king in his beauty.  They will see
        a distant land.
033:018 Your heart will meditate on the terror.  Where is he who counted?
        Where is he who weighed?  Where is he who counted the towers?
033:019 You will no longer see the fierce people, a people of a deep
        speech that you can't comprehend, with a strange language
        that you can't understand.
033:020 Look at Zion, the city of our appointed festivals.
        Your eyes will see Jerusalem, a quiet habitation, a tent
        that won't be removed.  Its stakes will never be plucked up,
        nor will any of its cords be broken.
033:021 But there Yahweh will be with us in majesty, a place of broad
        rivers and streams, in which no galley with oars will go,
        neither will any gallant ship pass by there.
033:022 For Yahweh is our judge.  Yahweh is our lawgiver.
        Yahweh is our king.  He will save us.
033:023 Your rigging is untied.  They couldn't strengthen the foot
        of their mast.  They couldn't spread the sail.  Then the prey
        of a great spoil was divided.  The lame took the prey.
033:024 The inhabitant won't say, "I am sick."  The people who dwell
        therein will be forgiven their iniquity.
034:001 Come near, you nations, to hear!  Listen, you peoples.
        Let the earth and all it contains hear; the world,
        and everything that comes from it.
034:002 For Yahweh is enraged against all the nations, and angry
        with all their armies.  He has utterly destroyed them.
        He has given them over for slaughter.
034:003 Their slain will also be cast out, and the stench of their dead
        bodies will come up; and the mountains will melt in their blood.
034:004 All of the army of the sky will be dissolved.  The sky will be
        rolled up like a scroll, and all its armies will fade away,
        as a leaf fades from off a vine or a fig tree.
034:005 For my sword has drunk its fill in the sky.  Behold, it will come
        down on Edom, and on the people of my curse, for judgment.
034:006 Yahweh's sword is filled with blood.  It is covered with fat,
        with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys
        of rams; for Yahweh has a sacrifice in Bozrah, And a great
        slaughter in the land of Edom.
034:007 The wild oxen will come down with them, and the young bulls
        with the mighty bulls; and their land will be drunken with blood,
        and their dust made greasy with fat.
034:008 For Yahweh has a day of vengeance, a year of recompense
        for the cause of Zion.
034:009 Its streams will be turned into pitch, its dust into sulfur,
        And its land will become burning pitch.
034:010 It won't be quenched night nor day.  Its smoke will go up forever.
        From generation to generation, it will lie waste.
        No one will pass through it forever and ever.
034:011 But the pelican and the porcupine will possess it.
        The owl and the raven will dwell in it.  He will stretch
        the line of confusion over it, and the plumb line of emptiness.
034:012 They shall call its nobles to the kingdom, but none shall be there;
        and all its princes shall be nothing.
034:013 Thorns will come up in its palaces, nettles and thistles
        in its fortresses; and it will be a habitation of jackals,
        a court for ostriches.
034:014 The wild animals of the desert will meet with the wolves,
        and the wild goat will cry to his fellow.  Yes, the night
        creature{literally, lilith, which could also be a night demon
        or night monster} shall settle there, and shall find herself
        a place of rest.
034:015 The arrow snake will make her nest there, and lay, hatch, and gather
        under her shade.  Yes, the kites will be gathered there,
        every one with her mate.
034:016 Search in the book of Yahweh, and read:  not one of these will
        be missing.  none will lack her mate.  For my mouth has commanded,
        and his Spirit has gathered them.
034:017 He has cast the lot for them, and his hand has divided it
        to them with a measuring line.  They shall possess it forever.
        From generation to generation they will dwell in it.
035:001 The wilderness and the dry land will be glad.  The desert
        will rejoice and blossom like a rose.
035:002 It will blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing.
        Lebanon's glory Lebanon will be given to it, the excellence
        of Carmel and Sharon.  They will see Yahweh's glory,
        the excellence of our God.
035:003 Strengthen the weak hands, and make firm the feeble knees.
035:004 Tell those who have a fearful heart, "Be strong.  Don't be afraid.
        Behold, your God will come with vengeance, God's retribution.
        He will come and save you.
035:005 Then the eyes of the blind will be opened, and the ears
        of the deaf will be unstopped.
035:006 Then the lame man will leap like a deer, and the tongue of
        the mute will sing; for waters will break out in the wilderness,
        and streams in the desert.
035:007 The burning sand will become a pool, and the thirsty ground
        springs of water.  Grass with reeds and rushes will be in
        the habitation of jackals, where they lay.
035:008 A highway will be there, a road, and it will be called The Holy Way.
        The unclean shall not pass over it, but it will be for those
        who walk in the Way.  Wicked fools will not go there.
035:009 No lion will be there, nor will any ravenous animal go up on it.
        They will not be found there; but the redeemed will walk there.
035:010 The Yahweh's ransomed ones will return, and come with singing
        to Zion; and everlasting joy will be on their heads.
        They will obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing
        will flee away."
036:001 Now it happened in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah,
        that Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all of the fortified
        cities of Judah, and captured them.
036:002 The king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem
        to king Hezekiah with a large army.  He stood by the aqueduct
        from the upper pool in the fuller's field highway.
036:003 Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household,
        and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder
        came out to him.
036:004 Rabshakeh said to them, "Now tell Hezekiah, 'Thus says
        the great king, the king of Assyria, "What confidence is this
        in which you trust?
036:005 I say that your counsel and strength for the war are only vain words.
        Now in whom do you trust, that you have rebelled against me?
036:006 Behold, you trust in the staff of this bruised reed, even in Egypt,
        which if a man leans on it, it will go into his hand and pierce it.
        So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him.
036:007 But if you tell me, 'We trust in Yahweh our God,' isn't that
        he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away,
        and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, 'You shall worship
        before this altar?'"
036:008 Now therefore, please make a pledge to my master the king
        of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you
        are able on your part to set riders on them.
036:009 How then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least
        of my master's servants, and put your trust on Egypt for chariots
        and for horsemen?
036:010 Have I come up now without Yahweh against this land to destroy it?
        Yahweh said to me, "Go up against this land, and destroy it."'"
036:011 Then Eliakim, Shebna and Joah said to Rabshakeh, "Please speak
        to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it;
        and don't speak to us in the Jews' language in the hearing
        of the people who are on the wall."
036:012 But Rabshakeh said, "Has my master sent me only to your master
        and to you, to speak these words, and not to the men who sit
        on the wall, who will eat their own dung and drink their own
        urine with you?"
036:013 Then Rabshakeh stood, and called out with a loud voice in
        the Jews' language, and said, "Hear the words of the great king,
        the king of Assyria!
036:014 Thus says the king, 'Don't let Hezekiah deceive you;
        for he will not be able to deliver you.
036:015 Don't let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh, saying, "Yahweh will
        surely deliver us.  This city won't be given into the hand
        of the king of Assyria."'
036:016 Don't listen to Hezekiah, for thus says the king
        of Assyria, 'Make your peace with me, and come out to me;
        and each of you eat from his vine, and each one from his fig tree,
        and each one of you drink the waters of his own cistern;
036:017 until I come and take you away to a land like your own land,
        a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
036:018 Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, "Yahweh will deliver us."
        Have any of the gods of the nations delivered their lands
        from the hand of the king of Assyria?
036:019 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad?  Where are the gods
        of Sepharvaim?  Have they delivered Samaria from my hand?
036:020 Who are they among all the gods of these countries that have
        delivered their country out of my hand, that Yahweh should
        deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?'"
036:021 But they remained silent, and said nothing in reply,
        for the king's commandment was, "Don't answer him."
036:022 Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household,
        and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder,
        came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him
        the words of Rabshakeh.
037:001 It happened, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he tore his clothes,
        covered himself with sackcloth, and went into Yahweh's house.
037:002 He sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe,
        and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth,
        to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz.
037:003 They said to him, "Thus says Hezekiah, 'This day is a day of trouble,
        and of rebuke, and of rejection; for the children have come
        to the birth, and there is no strength to bring forth.
037:004 It may be Yahweh your God will hear the words of Rabshakeh,
        whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to defy the living God,
        and will rebuke the words which Yahweh your God has heard.
        Therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.'"
037:005 So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
037:006 Isaiah said to them, "Tell your master, 'Thus says Yahweh, "Don't be
        afraid of the words that you have heard, with which the servants
        of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
037:007 Behold, I will put a spirit in him and he will hear news,
        and will return to his own land.  I will cause him to fall
        by the sword in his own land."'"
037:008 So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring
        against Libnah, for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.
037:009 He heard news concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, "He has
        come out to fight against you."  When he heard it, he sent
        messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
037:010 "Thus shall you speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, 'Don't let
        your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, "Jerusalem won't
        be given into the hand of the king of Assyria."
037:011 Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria
        have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly.
        Shall you be delivered?
037:012 Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers
        have destroyed, Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the children of Eden
        who were in Telassar?
037:013 Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king
        of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?'"
037:014 Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers
        and read it.  Then Hezekiah went up to Yahweh's house,
        and spread it before Yahweh.
037:015 Hezekiah prayed to Yahweh, saying,
037:016 "Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, who is enthroned among
        the cherubim, you are the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms
        of the earth.  You have made heaven and earth.
037:017 Turn your ear, Yahweh, and hear.  Open your eyes, Yahweh, and behold.
        Hear all of the words of Sennacherib, who has sent to defy
        the living God.
037:018 Truly, Yahweh, the kings of Assyria have destroyed all
        the countries and their land,
037:019 and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods,
        but the work of men's hands, wood and stone; therefore they
        have destroyed them.
037:020 Now therefore, Yahweh our God, save us from his hand,
        that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you are Yahweh,
        even you only."
037:021 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, "Thus
        says Yahweh, the God of Israel, 'Because you have prayed
        to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria,
037:022 this is the word which Yahweh has spoken concerning him.
        The virgin daughter of Zion has despised you and ridiculed you.
        The daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you.
037:023 Whom have you defied and blasphemed?  Against whom have
        you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high?
        Against the Holy One of Israel.
037:024 By your servants, have you defied the Lord, and have said,
        "With the multitude of my chariots I have come up to the height
        of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon.
        I will cut down its tall cedars and its choice fir trees.
        I will enter into its farthest height, the forest of
        its fruitful field.
037:025 I have dug and drunk water, and with the sole of my feet I
        will dry up all the rivers of Egypt."
037:026 Have you not heard how I have done it long ago, and formed it
        in ancient times?  Now I have brought it to pass, that it
        should be yours to destroy fortified cities, turning them
        into ruinous heaps.
037:027 Therefore their inhabitants had little power.  They were dismayed
        and confounded.  They were like the grass of the field,
        and like the green herb, like the grass on the housetops,
        and like a field before its crop has grown.
037:028 But I know your sitting down, your going out, your coming in,
        and your raging against me.
037:029 Because of your raging against me, and because your arrogance
        has come up into my ears, therefore will I put my hook
        in your nose and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you
        back by the way by which you came.
037:030 This shall be the sign to you.  You will eat this year that
        which grows of itself, and in the second year that which
        springs from the same; and in the third year sow and reap
        and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.
037:031 The remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah will again
        take root downward, and bear fruit upward.
037:032 For out of Jerusalem a remnant will go forth, and survivors
        will escape from Mount Zion.  The zeal of Yahweh of Armies
        will perform this.'
037:033 Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the king of Assyria, 'He will
        not come to this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither will
        he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.
037:034 By the way that he came, by the same he shall return,
        and he shall not come to this city,' says Yahweh.
037:035 'For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake,
        and for my servant David's sake.'"
037:036 The angel of Yahweh went out and struck one hundred and
        eighty-five thousand men in the camp of the Assyrians.
        When men arose early in the morning, behold, these were
        all dead bodies.
037:037 So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, went away,
        returned to Nineveh, and stayed there.
037:038 It happened, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch
        his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons struck him
        with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat.
        Esar Haddon his son reigned in his place.
038:001 In those days was Hezekiah sick and near death.
        Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, came to him, and said to him,
        "Thus says Yahweh, 'Set your house in order, for you will die,
        and not live.'"
038:002 Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to Yahweh,
038:003 and said, "Remember now, Yahweh, I beg you, how I have walked
        before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done
        that which is good in your sight."  Hezekiah wept bitterly.
038:004 Then the word of Yahweh came to Isaiah, saying,
038:005 "Go, and tell Hezekiah, 'Thus says Yahweh, the God of David
        your father, "I have heard your prayer.  I have seen your tears.
        Behold, I will add fifteen years to your life.
038:006 I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king
        of Assyria, and I will defend this city.
038:007 This shall be the sign to you from Yahweh, that Yahweh will
        do this thing that he has spoken.
038:008 Behold, I will cause the shadow on the sundial, which has gone down
        on the sundial of Ahaz with the sun, to return backward ten steps.
        So the sun returned ten steps on the sundial on which it
        had gone down."'"
038:009 The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick,
        and had recovered of his sickness.
038:010 I said, "In the middle of my life I go into the gates of Sheol.
        I am deprived of the residue of my years."
038:011 I said, "I won't see Yah, Yah in the land of the living.
        I will see man no more with the inhabitants of the world.
038:012 My dwelling is removed, and is carried away from me like a
        shepherd's tent.  I have rolled up, like a weaver, my life.
        He will cut me off from the loom.  From day even to night
        you will make an end of me.
038:013 I waited patiently until morning.  He breaks all my bones like
        a lion.  From day even to night you will make an end of me.
038:014 I chattered like a swallow or a crane.  I moaned like a dove.
        My eyes weaken looking upward.  Lord, I am oppressed.
        Be my security."
038:015 What will I say?  He has both spoken to me, and himself has done it.
        I will walk carefully all my years because of the anguish
        of my soul.
038:016 Lord, men live by these things; and my spirit finds life
        in all of them:  you restore me, and cause me to live.
038:017 Behold, for peace I had great anguish, but you have in love
        for my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption;
        for you have cast all my sins behind your back.
038:018 For Sheol can't praise you.  Death can't celebrate you.
        Those who go down into the pit can't hope for your truth.
038:019 The living, the living, he shall praise you, as I do this day.
        The father shall make known your truth to the children.
038:020 Yahweh will save me.  Therefore we will sing my songs with stringed
        instruments all the days of our life in the house of Yahweh.
038:021 Now Isaiah had said, "Let them take a cake of figs, and lay
        it for a poultice on the boil, and he shall recover."
038:022 Hezekiah also had said, "What is the sign that I will go up
        to the house of Yahweh?"
039:001 At that time, Merodach Baladan the son of Baladan,
        king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah;
        for he heard that he had been sick, and had recovered.
039:002 Hezekiah was pleased with them, and showed them the house
        of his precious things, the silver, and the gold,
        the spices, and the precious oil, and all the house
        of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures.
        There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion,
        that Hezekiah didn't show them.
039:003 Then Isaiah the prophet came to king Hezekiah, and asked him,
        "What did these men say?  Where did they come from to you?"
        Hezekiah said, "They have come from a country far from me,
        even from Babylon."
039:004 Then he asked, "What have they seen in your house?"
        Hezekiah answered, "They have seen all that is in my house.
        There is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them."
039:005 Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, "Hear the word of Yahweh of Armies:
039:006 'Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house,
        and that which your fathers have stored up until this day,
        will be carried to Babylon.  Nothing will be left,' says Yahweh.
039:007 'They will take away your sons who will issue from you,
        whom you shall father, and they will be eunuchs in the king
        of Babylon's palace.'"
039:008 Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "Yahweh's word which you have
        spoken is good."  He said moreover, "For there will be peace
        and truth in my days."
040:001 "Comfort, comfort my people," says your God.
040:002 "Speak comfortably to Jerusalem; and call out to her that her
        warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned,
        that she has received of Yahweh's hand double for all her sins."
040:003 The voice of one who calls out, "Prepare the way of Yahweh
        in the wilderness!  Make a level highway in the desert
        for our God.
040:004 Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall
        be made low.  The uneven shall be made level, and the rough
        places a plain.
040:005 The glory of Yahweh shall be revealed, and all flesh shall
        see it together; for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it."
040:006 The voice of one saying, "Cry!"  One said, "What shall I cry?"
        "All flesh is like grass, and all its glory is like the flower
        of the field.
040:007 The grass withers, the flower fades, because Yahweh's breath
        blows on it.  Surely the people are like grass.
040:008 The grass withers, the flower fades; but the word of our
        God stands forever."
040:009 You who tell good news to Zion, go up on a high mountain.
        You who tell good news to Jerusalem, lift up your
        voice with strength.  Lift it up.  Don't be afraid.
        Say to the cities of Judah, "Behold, your God!"
040:010 Behold, the Lord Yahweh will come as a mighty one, and his
        arm will rule for him.  Behold, his reward is with him,
        and his recompense before him.
040:011 He will feed his flock like a shepherd.  He will gather
        the lambs in his arm, and carry them in his bosom.
        He will gently lead those who have their young.
040:012 Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand,
        and marked off the sky with his span, and calculated the dust
        of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales,
        and the hills in a balance?
040:013 Who has directed the Spirit of Yahweh, or has taught him
        as his counselor?
040:014 Who did he take counsel with, and who instructed him,
        and taught him in the path of justice, and taught him knowledge,
        and showed him the way of understanding?
040:015 Behold, the nations are like a drop in a bucket, and are
        regarded as a speck of dust on a balance.  Behold, he lifts
        up the islands like a very little thing.
040:016 Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor its animals sufficient
        for a burnt offering.
040:017 All the nations are like nothing before him.  They are regarded
        by him as less than nothing, and vanity.
040:018 To whom then will you liken God?  Or what likeness will you
        compare to him?
040:019 A workman has cast an image, and the goldsmith overlays it
        with gold, and casts silver chains for it.
040:020 He who is too impoverished for such an offering chooses a tree
        that will not rot.  He seeks a skillful workman to set up
        an engraved image for him that will not be moved.
040:021 Haven't you known?  Haven't you heard, yet?  Haven't you
        been told from the beginning?  Haven't you understood from
        the foundations of the earth?
040:022 It is he who sits above the circle of the earth, and its
        inhabitants are like grasshoppers; who stretches out the heavens
        like a curtain, and spreads them out like a tent to dwell in;
040:023 who brings princes to nothing; who makes the judges of the
        earth like meaningless.
040:024 They are planted scarcely.  They are sown scarcely.
        Their stock has scarcely taken root in the ground.
        He merely blows on them, and they wither, and the whirlwind
        takes them away as stubble.
040:025 "To whom then will you liken me?  Who is my equal?"
        says the Holy One.
040:026 Lift up your eyes on high, and see who has created these,
        who brings out their army by number.  He calls them all by name.
        by the greatness of his might, and because he is strong in power,
        Not one is lacking.
040:027 Why do you say, Jacob, and speak, Israel, "My way is hidden
        from Yahweh, and the justice due me is disregarded by my God?"
040:028 Haven't you known?  Haven't you heard?  The everlasting
        God, Yahweh, The Creator of the ends of the earth, doesn't faint.
        He isn't weary.  His understanding is unsearchable.
040:029 He gives power to the weak.  He increases the strength of him
        who has no might.
040:030 Even the youths faint and get weary, and the young men utterly fall;
040:031 But those who wait for Yahweh will renew their strength.
        They will mount up with wings like eagles.  They will run,
        and not be weary.  They will walk, and not faint.
041:001 "Keep silent before me, islands, and let the peoples renew
        their strength.  Let them come near, then let them speak.
        Let's meet together for judgment.
041:002 Who has raised up one from the east?  Whom called him to his foot
        in righteousness?  He hands over nations to him, and makes him
        rule over kings.  He gives them like the dust to his sword,
        like the driven stubble to his bow.
041:003 He pursues them, and passes by safely, Even by a way that he had
        not gone with his feet.
041:004 Who has worked and done it, calling the generations from
        the beginning?  I, Yahweh, the first, and with the last,
        I am he."
041:005 The islands have seen, and fear.  The ends of the earth tremble.
        They approach, and come.
041:006 Everyone helps his neighbor.  They say to their brothers,
        "Be strong!"
041:007 So the carpenter encourages the goldsmith.  He who smoothes
        with the hammer encourages him who strikes the anvil,
        saying of the soldering, "It is good;" and he fastens it
        with nails, that it might not totter.
041:008 "But you, Israel, my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen,
        the seed of Abraham my friend,
041:009 You whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth,
        and called from its corners, and said to you, 'You are my servant,
        I have chosen you and not cast you away;'
041:010 Don't you be afraid, for I am with you.  Don't be dismayed,
        for I am your God.  I will strengthen you.  Yes, I will help you.
        Yes, I will uphold you with the right hand of my righteousness.
041:011 Behold, all those who are incensed against you will be disappointed
        and confounded.  Those who strive with you will be like nothing,
        and shall perish.
041:012 You will seek them, and won't find them, even those who contend
        with you.  Those who war against you will be as nothing,
        as a non-existent thing.
041:013 For I, Yahweh your God, will hold your right hand, saying to you,
        'Don't be afraid.  I will help you.'
041:014 Don't be afraid, you worm Jacob, and you men of Israel.
        I will help you," says Yahweh, "and your Redeemer is
        the Holy One of Israel.
041:015 Behold, I have made you into a new sharp threshing instrument
        with teeth.  You will thresh the mountains, and beat them small,
        and will make the hills like chaff.
041:016 You will winnow them, and the wind will carry them away,
        and the whirlwind will scatter them.  You will rejoice in Yahweh.
        You will glory in the Holy One of Israel.
041:017 The poor and needy seek water, and there is none.
        Their tongue fails for thirst.  I, Yahweh, will answer them.
        I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them.
041:018 I will open rivers on the bare heights, and springs in the midst
        of the valleys.  I will make the wilderness a pool of water,
        and the dry land springs of water.
041:019 I will put cedar, acacia, myrtle, and oil trees in the wilderness.
        I will set fir trees, pine, and box trees together in the desert;
041:020 that they may see, know, consider, and understand together,
        that the hand of Yahweh has done this, and the Holy One
        of Israel has created it.
041:021 Produce your cause," says Yahweh.  "Bring forth your strong reasons,"
        says the King of Jacob.
041:022 "Let them announce, and declare to us what shall happen.
        Declare the former things, what they are, that we may consider them,
        and know the latter end of them; or show us things to come.
041:023 Declare the things that are to come hereafter, that we
        may know that you are gods.  Yes, do good, or do evil,
        that we may be dismayed, and see it together.
041:024 Behold, you are of nothing, and your work is of nothing.
        He who chooses you is an abomination.
041:025 "I have raised up one from the north, and he has come;
        from the rising of the sun, one who calls on my name; and he shall
        come on rulers as on mortar, and as the potter treads clay.
041:026 Who has declared it from the beginning, that we may know?
        And before, that we may say, 'He is right?'  Surely, there is
        no one who declares.  Surely, there is no one who shows.
        Surely, there is no one who hears your words.
041:027 I am the first to say to Zion, 'Behold, look at them;'
        and I will give one who brings good news to Jerusalem.
041:028 When I look, there is no man; even among them there is no
        counselor who, when I ask of them, can answer a word.
041:029 Behold, all of them, their works are vanity and nothing.
        Their molten images are wind and confusion.
042:001 "Behold, my servant, whom I uphold; my chosen,
        in whom my soul delights--I have put my Spirit on him.
        He will bring justice to the nations.
042:002 He will not shout, nor raise his voice, nor cause it to be heard
        in the street.
042:003 He won't break a bruised reed.  He won't quench a dimly burning wick.
        He will faithfully bring justice.
042:004 He will not fail nor be discouraged, until he has set justice
        in the earth, and the islands will wait for his law."
042:005 Thus says God Yahweh, he who created the heavens and stretched
        them out, he who spread out the earth and that which comes
        out of it, he who gives breath to its people and spirit
        to those who walk in it.
042:006 "I, Yahweh, have called you in righteousness, and will hold your hand,
        and will keep you, and make you a covenant for the people,
        as a light for the nations;
042:007 to open the blind eyes, to bring the prisoners out of the dungeon,
        and those who sit in darkness out of the prison.
042:008 "I am Yahweh.  That is my name.  I will not give my glory
        to another, nor my praise to engraved images.
042:009 Behold, the former things have happened, and I declare new things.
        I tell you about them before they come up."
042:010 Sing to Yahweh a new song, and his praise from the end of
        the earth, you who go down to the sea, and all that is therein,
        the islands and their inhabitants.
042:011 Let the wilderness and its cities raise their voices, with the
        villages that Kedar inhabits.  Let the inhabitants of Sela sing.
        Let them shout from the top of the mountains!
042:012 Let them give glory to Yahweh, and declare his praise
        in the islands.
042:013 Yahweh will go out like a mighty man.  He will stir up zeal like a
        man of war.  He will raise a war cry.  Yes, he will shout aloud.
        He will triumph over his enemies.
042:014 "I have been silent a long time.  I have been quiet and
        restrained myself.  Now I will cry out like a travailing woman.
        I will both gasp and pant.
042:015 I will destroy mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs.
        I will make the rivers islands, and will dry up the pools.
042:016 I will bring the blind by a way that they don't know.
        I will lead them in paths that they don't know.  I will make
        darkness light before them, and crooked places straight.
        I will do these things, and I will not forsake them.
042:017 "Those who trust in engraved images, who tell molten images,
        'You are our gods' will be turned back.  They will
        be utterly disappointed.
042:018 "Hear, you deaf, and look, you blind, that you may see.
042:019 Who is blind, but my servant?  Or who is as deaf as my
        messenger whom I send?  Who is as blind as he who is at peace,
        and as blind as Yahweh's servant?
042:020 You see many things, but don't observe.  His ears are open,
        but he doesn't listen.
042:021 It pleased Yahweh, for his righteousness' sake, to magnify
        the law, and make it honorable.
042:022 But this is a robbed and plundered people.  All of them
        are snared in holes, and they are hidden in prisons.
        They have become a prey, and no one delivers; and a spoil,
        and no one says, 'Restore them!'
042:023 Who is there among you who will give ear to this?
        Who will listen and hear for the time to come?
042:024 Who gave Jacob as plunder, and Israel to the robbers?
        Didn't Yahweh, he against whom we have sinned?  For they
        would not walk in his ways, and they disobeyed his law.
042:025 Therefore he poured the fierceness of his anger on him,
        and the strength of battle; and it set him on fire all around,
        but he didn't know; and it burned him, but he didn't take
        it to heart."
043:001 But now thus says Yahweh who created you, Jacob, and he who
        formed you, Israel:  "Don't be afraid, for I have redeemed you.
        I have called you by your name.  You are mine.
043:002 When you pass through the waters, I will be with you;
        and through the rivers, they will not overflow you.
        When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned,
        and flame will not scorch you.
043:003 For I am Yahweh your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior.
        I have given Egypt as your ransom, Ethiopia and Seba
        in your place.
043:004 Since you have been precious and honored in my sight, and I
        have loved you; therefore I will give people in your place,
        and nations instead of your life.
043:005 Don't be afraid; for I am with you.  I will bring your seed
        from the east, and gather you from the west.
043:006 I will tell the north, 'Give them up!' and tell the south,
        'Don't hold them back!  Bring my sons from far, and my daughters
        from the ends of the earth--
043:007 everyone who is called by my name, and whom I have created
        for my glory, whom I have formed, yes, whom I have made.'"
043:008 Bring out the blind people who have eyes, and the deaf
        who have ears.
043:009 Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the peoples
        be assembled.  Who among them can declare this, and show us
        former things?  Let them bring their witnesses, that they
        may be justified; or let them hear, and say, "That is true."
043:010 "You are my witnesses," says Yahweh, "With my servant
        whom I have chosen; that you may know and believe me,
        and understand that I am he.  Before me there was no God formed,
        neither will there be after me.
043:011 I myself am Yahweh; and besides me there is no savior.
043:012 I have declared, I have saved, and I have shown; and there was
        no strange god among you.  Therefore you are my witnesses,"
        says Yahweh, "and I am God.
043:013 Yes, since the day was I am he; and there is no one who can
        deliver out of my hand.  I will work, and who can hinder it?"
043:014 Thus says Yahweh, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel:
        "For your sake, I have sent to Babylon, and I will bring all
        of them down as fugitives, even the Chaldeans, in the ships
        of their rejoicing.
043:015 I am Yahweh, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King."
043:016 Thus says Yahweh, who makes a way in the sea, and a path
        in the mighty waters;
043:017 who brings forth the chariot and horse, the army and the mighty man
        (they lie down together, they shall not rise; they are extinct,
        they are quenched like a wick):
043:018 "Don't remember the former things, and don't consider
        the things of old.
043:019 Behold, I will do a new thing.  It springs forth now.
        Don't you know it?  I will even make a way in the wilderness,
        and rivers in the desert.
043:020 The animals of the field shall honor me, the jackals and
        the ostriches; because I give water in the wilderness and rivers
        in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen,
043:021 the people which I formed for myself, that they might set
        forth my praise.
043:022 Yet you have not called on me, Jacob; but you have been weary
        of me, Israel.
043:023 You have not brought me of your sheep for burnt offerings;
        neither have you honored me with your sacrifices.
        I have not burdened you with offerings, nor wearied
        you with frankincense.
043:024 You have bought me no sweet cane with money, nor have you filled
        me with the fat of your sacrifices; but you have burdened me
        with your sins.  You have wearied me with your iniquities.
043:025 I, even I, am he who blots out your transgressions for my own sake;
        and I will not remember your sins.
043:026 Put me in remembrance.  Let us plead together.  Set forth
        your case, that you may be justified.
043:027 Your first father sinned, and your teachers have transgressed
        against me.
043:028 Therefore I will profane the princes of the sanctuary;
        and I will make Jacob a curse, and Israel a reviling."
044:001 Yet listen now, Jacob my servant, and Israel, whom I have chosen.
044:002 This is what Yahweh who made you, and formed you from the womb,
        who will help you says:  "Don't be afraid, Jacob my servant;
        and you, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.
044:003 For I will pour water on him who is thirsty, and streams
        on the dry ground.  I will pour my Spirit on your seed,
        and my blessing on your offspring:
044:004 and they will spring up among the grass, as willows
        by the watercourses.
044:005 One will say, 'I am Yahweh's;' and another will be called by the name
        of Jacob; and another will write with his hand 'to Yahweh,'
        and honor the name of Israel."
044:006 This is what Yahweh, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer, Yahweh
        of Armies, says:  "I am the first, and I am the last;
        and besides me there is no God.
044:007 Who is like me?  Who will call, and will declare it, and set
        it in order for me, since I established the ancient people?
        Let them declare the things that are coming, and that will happen.
044:008 Don't fear, neither be afraid.  Haven't I declared it
        to you long ago, and shown it?  You are my witnesses.
        Is there a God besides me?  Indeed, there is not.
        I don't know any other Rock."
044:009 Everyone who makes an engraved image is vain.  The things that they
        delight in will not profit.  Their own witnesses don't see,
        nor know, that they may be disappointed.
044:010 Who has fashioned a god, or molds an image that is
        profitable for nothing?
044:011 Behol
