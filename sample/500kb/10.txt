ral Preston, in that awful hour,
  When on one leg he hopp'd to--take the Tower!),
  And here, and there, explored with active fin,
  And skilful feint, some guardless pass to win,
  And prove a boring guest when once let in.
  And now Entellus, with an eye that plann'd
  Punishing deeds, high raised his heavy hand;
  But ere the sledge came down, young Dares spied
  Its shadow o'er his brow, and slipped aside--
  So nimbly slipp'd, that the vain nobber pass'd
  Through empty air; and He, so high, so vast,
  Who dealt the stroke, came thundering to the ground!--
  Not B-ck--gh-m himself, with balkier sound,
  Uprooted from the field of Whiggist glories,
  Fell souse, of late, among the astonish'd Tories!
  Instant the ring was broke, and shouts and yells
  From Trojan Flashmen and Sicilian Swells
  Fill'd the wide heaven--while, touch'd with grief to see
  His pall, well-known through many a lark and spree, [8]
  Thus rumly floor'd, the kind Ascestes ran,  [9]
  And pitying rais'd from earth the game old man.
  Uncow'd, undamaged to the sport he came,
  His limbs all muscle, and his soul all flame.
  The memory of his milling glories past,  [10]
  The shame that aught but death should see him grass'd.
  All fired the veteran's pluck--with fury flush'd,
  Full on his light-limb'd customer he rush'd,--
  And hammering right and left, with ponderous swing [11]
  Ruffian'd the reeling youngster round the ring--
  Nor rest, nor pause, nor breathing-time was given
  But, rapid as the rattling hail from heaven
  Beats on the house-top, showers of Randall's shot
  Around the Trojan's lugs fell peppering hot!
  'Till now Aeneas, fill'd with anxious dread,
  Rush'd in between them, and, with words well-bred,
  Preserved alike the peace and Dares' head,
  Both which the veteran much inclined to break--
  Then kindly thus the punish'd youth bespake:
  "Poor Johnny Raw! what madness could impel
  So rum a Flat to face so prime a Swell?
  See'st thou not, boy, the Fancy, heavenly maid,
  Herself descends to this great Hammerer's aid,
  And, singling him from all her flash adorers,
  Shines in his hits, and thunders in his floorers?
  Then, yield thee, youth,--nor such a spooney be,
  To think mere man can mill a Deity!"
  Thus spoke the chief--and now, the scrimmage o'er,
  His faithful pals the done-up Dares bore
  Back to his home, with tottering gams, sunk heart,
  And muns and noddle pink'd in every part.
  While from his gob the guggling claret gush'd  [12]
  And lots of grinders, from their sockets crush'd  [13]
  Forth with the crimson tide in rattling fragments rush'd!

YA-HIP, MY HEARTIES!
[1819]

[From MOORE'S _Tom Crib's Memorial to Congress_:--"Sung by Jack
Holmes, the Coachman, at a late Masquerade in St Giles's, in the
character of Lord C--st--e--on ... This song which was written for him
by Mr. Gregson, etc."].


I

  I first was hired to _peg a Hack_ [1]
  They call "The Erin" sometime back,
  Where soon I learned to _patter flash_, [2]
  To curb the tits, and tip the lash--  [3]
  Which pleased _the Master of_ The Crown
  So much, he had me up to town,
  And gave me _lots_ of _quids_ a year, [4]
  To _tool_ "The Constitutions" here. [5]
    So, ya-hip, hearties, here am I
    That drive the Constitution Fly.

II

  Some wonder how the Fly holds out,
  So rotten 'tis, within, without;
  So loaded too, through thick and thin,
  And with such _heavy_ creturs IN.
  But, Lord, 't will last our time--or if
  The wheels should, now and then, get stiff,
  Oil of Palm's the thing that, flowing, [6]
  Sets the naves and felloes going.
  So ya-hip, _Hearties_! etc.

III

  Some wonder, too, the _tits_ that pull
  This _rum concern_ along, so full,
  Should never _back_ or _bolt_, or kick
  The load and driver to Old Nick.
  But, never fear, the breed, though British,
  Is now no longer _game_ or skittish;
  Except sometimes about their corn,
  Tamer _Houghnhums_ ne'er were born.
  So ya-hip, _Hearties_, etc.

IV

  And then so sociably we ride!--
  While some have places, snug, inside,
  Some hoping to be there anon.
  Through many a dirty road _hang on_.
  And when we reach a filthy spot
  (Plenty of which there are, God wot),
  You'd laugh to see with what an air
  We _take_ the spatter--each his share.
  So ya-hip, _Hearties_! etc.

SONNETS FOR THE FANCY: AFTER THE MANNER OF PETRARCH [Notes]
[_c._ 1824]

[From _Boxiana_, iii. 621. 622].


_Education._

A link-boy once, Dick Hellfinch stood the grin,
  At Charing Cross he long his toil apply'd;
"Here light, here light! your honours for a win," [1]
  To every cull and drab he loudly cried. [2]
In Leicester Fields, as most the story know,
  "Come black your worship for a single mag," [3]
  And while he shin'd his Nelly suck'd the bag, [4]
And thus they sometimes stagg'd a precious go. [5]
  In Smithfield, too, where graziers' flats resort,
He loiter'd there to take in men of cash,
  With cards and dice was up to ev'ry sport,
And at Saltpetre Bank would cut a dash;
  A very knowing rig in ev'ry gang, [6]
  Dick Hellfinch was the pick of all the slang. [7]

_Progress._

His Nell sat on Newgate steps, and scratch'd her poll,
Her eyes suffus'd with tears, and bung'd with gin;
The Session's sentence wrung her to the soul,
  Nor could she lounge the gag to shule a win;
The knowing bench had tipp'd her buzer queer, [8]
  For Dick had beat the hoof upon the pad,
  Of Field, or Chick-lane--was the boldest lad
That ever mill'd the cly, or roll'd the leer. [9]
  And with Nell he kept a lock, to fence, and tuz,
And while his flaming mot was on the lay,
  With rolling kiddies, Dick would dive and buz,
And cracking kens concluded ev'ry day; [10]
  But fortune fickle, ever on the wheel,
  Turn'd up a rubber, for these smarts to feel.

_Triumph._

Both'ring the flats assembled round the quod, [11]
  The queerum queerly smear'd with dirty black; [12]
The dolman sounding, while the sheriff's nod,
  Prepare the switcher to dead book the whack,
While in a rattle sit two blowens flash, [13]
  Salt tears fast streaming from each bungy eye;
  To nail the ticker, or to mill the cly  [14]
Through thick and thin their busy muzzlers splash,
  The mots lament for Tyburn's merry roam,
That bubbl'd prigs must at the New Drop fall,  [15]
  And from the start the scamps are cropp'd at home;
All in the sheriff's picture frame the call  [16]
  Exalted high, Dick parted with his flame,
  And all his comrades swore that he dy'd game.

THE TRUE BOTTOM'D BOXER
[1825]

[By J. JONES in _Universal Songster_, ii. 96]. Air: "_Oh!
nothing in life can sadden us._"


I

Spring's the boy for a Moulsey-Hurst rig, my lads,
  Shaking a flipper, and milling a pate;
Fibbing a nob is most excellent gig, my lads,
  Kneading the dough is a turn-out in state.
Tapping the claret to him is delighting,
  Belly-go-firsters and clicks of the gob;
For where are such joys to be found as in fighting,
  And measuring mugs for a chancery job:
With flipping and milling, and fobbing and nobbing,
  With belly-go-firsters and kneading the dough,
With tapping of claret, and clipping and gobbing,
  Say just what you please, you must own he's the go.

II

Spring's the boy for flooring and flushing it,
  Hitting and stopping, advance and retreat,
For taking and giving, for sparring and rushing it,
  And will ne'er say enough, till he's down right dead beat;
No crossing for him, true courage and bottom all,
  You'll find him a rum un, try on if you can;
You shy-cocks, he shows 'em no favour, 'od rot 'em all,
  When he fights he trys to accomplish his man;
With giving and taking, and flooring and flushing,
  With hitting and stopping, huzza to the ring,
With chancery suiting, and sparring and rushing,
  He's the champion of fame, and of manhood the spring.

III

Spring's the boy for rum going and coming it,
  Smashing and dashing, and tipping it prime,
Eastward and westward, and sometimes back-slumming it,
  He's for the scratch, and come up too in time;
For the victualling-office no favor he'll ask it,
  For smeller and ogles he feels just the same;
At the pipkin to point, or upset the bread-basket,
  He's always in twig, and bang-up for the game;
With going and tipping, and priming and timing
  'Till groggy and queery, straight-forwards the rig;
With ogles and smellers, no piping and chiming,
  You'll own he's the boy that is always in twig.




BOBBY AND HIS MARY         [Notes]
[1826]

[From _Universal Songster_, iii. 108].
Tune--_Dulce Domum_.


In Dyot-street a booze-ken stood, [1]
  Oft sought by foot-pads weary,
And long had been the blest abode
  Of Bobby, and his Mary.
For her he'd nightly pad the hoof,  [2]
  And gravel tax collect [3]
For her he never shammed the snite.
  Though traps tried to detect him;  [4]
When darkey came he sought his home
  While she, distracted blowen  [5]
    She hailed his sight,
    And, ev'ry night
    The booze-ken rung
    As they sung,
  O, Bobby and his Mary.

II

But soon this scene of cozey fuss
  Was changed to prospects queering
The blunt ran shy, and Bobby brush'd, [6]
  To get more rag not fearing;  [7]
To Islington he quickly hied,
  A traveller there he dropped on;
The traps were fly, his rig they spied  [8]
  And ruffles soon they popped on.  [9]
When evening came, he sought not home,
  While she, poor stupid woman,
    Got lushed that night,  [10]
    Oh, saw his sprite,
    Then heard the knell
    That bids farewell!
    Then heard the knell
    Of St. Pulchre's bell!  [11]
  Now he dangles on the Common.

FLASHEY JOE   [Notes]
[1826]

[By R. MORLEY in _Universal Songster_, ii. 194].


I

As Flashey Joe one day did pass
  Through London streets, so jolly,
A crying fish, he spied a lass
  'Twas Tothill's pride, sweet Molly!
He wip'd his mug with bird's-eye blue [1]
  He cried,--"Come, buss your own dear Joe"; [2]
She turned aside, alas! 'tis true
  And bawled out--"Here's live mackerel, O!
    Four a shilling, mackerel, O!
    All alive, O!
    New mackerel, O."

II

Says I,--"Miss Moll, don't tip this gam, [3]
  You knows as how it will not do;
For you I milled flash Dustman Sam   [4]
  Who made your peepers black and blue. [5]
Vhy, then you swore you would be kind
  But you have queer'd so much of late, [6]
And always changing like the wind,
  So now I'll brush and sell my skate."  [7]
    Buy my skate, etc.

III

She blubb'd--"Now, Joe, vhy treat me ill?
  You know I love you as my life!
When I forsook both Sam and Will,
  And promised to become your wife,
You molled it up with Brick-dust Sall [8]
  And went to live with her in quod! [9]
So I'll pike off with my mack'ral  [10]
  And you may bolt with your salt cod."
    Here's mack'rel, etc.

IV

I could not part with her, d'ye see
  So I tells Moll to stop her snivel;  [11]
"Your panting bubs and glist'ning eye [12]
  Just make me love you like the divil."
"Vhy, then," says she, "come tip's your dad, [13]
  And let us take a drap of gin,
And may I choke with hard-roed shad
  If I forsake my Joe Herring."
    Four a shilling, etc.

MY MUGGING MAID    [Notes]
[1826]

[By JAMES BRUTON. _Universal Songster_, iii. 103].


I

Why lie ye in that ditch, so snug,
  With s-- and filth bewrayed [1]
With hair all dangling down thy lug [2]
                          My mugging maid?
II

Say, mugging Moll, why that red-rag [3]
  Which oft hath me dismayed
Why is it now so mute in mag, [4]
                          My mugging maid?

II

Why steals the booze down through thy snout, [5]
  With mulberry's blue arrayed,
And why from throat steals hiccough out
                          My mugging maid?

IV

Why is thy mug so wan and blue, [6]
  In mud and muck you're laid;
Say, what's the matter now with you
                          My mugging maid?

V

The flask that in her fam appeared [7]
  The snore her conk betrayed,  [8]
Told me, that Hodge's max had queered [9]

ON THE PRIGGING LAY    [Notes]
[1829]

[By H. T. R....: a translation of a French
  Slang song ("Un jour a la Croix Rouge")
  in Vidocq's _Memoirs_, 1828-9, 4 vols.]


I

Ten or a dozen "cocks of the game," [1]
  On the prigging lay to the flash-house came, [2]
Lushing blue ruin and heavy wet [3]
  Till the darkey, when the downy set. [4]
All toddled and begun the hunt
  For readers, tattlers, fogies, or blunt. [5]

II

Whatever swag we chance for to get, [6]
  All is fish that comes to net:
Mind your eye, and draw the yokel,
  Don't disturb or use the folk ill.
Keep a look out, if the beaks are nigh,  [7]
  And cut your stick, before they're fly. [8]

III

As I vas a crossing St James's Park
  I met a swell, a well-togg'd spark. [9]
I stops a bit: then toddled quicker,
  For I'd prigged his reader, drawn his ticker; [10]
Then he calls--"Stop thief!" thinks I, my master,
  That's a hint to me to mizzle faster.  [11]

IV

When twelve bells chimed, the prigs returned, [12]
  And rapped at the ken of Uncle ----: [13]
"Uncle, open the door of your crib
  If you'd share the swag, or have one dib. [14]
Quickly draw the bolt of your ken,
  Or we'll not shell out a mag, old ----." [15]

V

Then says Uncle, says he, to his blowen, [16]
  "D'ye twig these coves, my mot so knowing? [17]
Are they out-and-outers, dearie?  [18]
  Are they fogle-hunters, or cracksmen leary? [19]
Are they coves of the ken, d'ye know?  [20]
  Shall I let 'em in, or tell 'em to go?"

VI

"Oh! I knows 'em now; hand over my breeches--
  I always look out for business--vich is
A reason vy a man should rouse
  At any hour for the good of his house,
The top o' the morning, gemmen all, [21]
  And for vot you vants, I begs you'll call."

VII

But now the beaks are on the scene, [22]
  And watched by moonlight where we went:--
Stagged us a toddling into the ken, [23]
  And were down upon us all; and then
Who should I spy but the slap-up spark  [24]
  What I eased of the swag in St James's Park. [25]

VIII

There's a time, says King Sol, to dance and sing;
  I know there's a time for another thing:
There's a time to pipe, and a time to snivel--
  I wish all Charlies and beaks at the divel: [26]
For they grabbed me on the prigging lay,
  And I know I'm booked for Bot'ny Bay. [27]

THE LAG'S LAMENT
[1829]

[By H. T. R. in _Vidocq's Memoirs_, Vol III. 169].


I

Happy the days when I vorked away,
  In my usual line in the prigging lay, [1]
Making from this, and that, and t'other,
  A tidy living without any bother:
When my little crib was stored with swag, [2]
  And my cly vas a veil-lined money bag, [3]
Jolly vas I, for I feared no evil,
  Funked at naught, and pitched care to the devil.

II

I had, beside my blunt, my blowen, [4]
  'So gay, so nutty and so knowing' [5]
On the wery best of grub we lived,   [6]
  And sixpence a quartern for gin I gived;
My toggs was the sportingst blunt could buy, [7]
  And a slap-up out-and-outer was I.
Vith my mot on my arm, and my tile on my head, [8]
  'That ere's a gemman' every von said.

III

A-coming avay from Wauxhall von night,
  I cleared out a muzzy cove quite;  [9]
He'd been a strutting avay like a king,
  And on his digit he sported a ring,
A di'mond sparkler, flash and knowing,
  Thinks I, I'll vatch the vay he's going,
And fleece my gemman neat and clever,
  So, at least I'll try my best endeavour.

IV

A'ter, the singing and fire-vorks vas ended,
  I follows my gemman the vay he tended;
In a dark corner I trips up his heels,
  Then for his tattler and reader I feels, [10]
I pouches his blunt, and I draws his ring, [11]
  Prigged his buckles and every thing,
And saying, "I thinks as you can't follow, man,"
  I pikes me off to Ikey Soloman.  [12]

V

Then it happened, d'ye see, that my mot,
  Yellow a-bit about the swag that I'd got,
Thinking that I should jeer and laugh,
  Although I never tips no chaff   [13]
Tries her hand at the downy trick,
  And prigs in a shop, but precious quick
"Stop thief!" was the cry, and she vas taken
  I cuts and runs and saves my bacon.

VI

"Then," says he, says Sir Richard Birnie, [14]
  "I adwise you to nose on your pals, and turn the [15]
Snitch on the gang, that'll be the best vay [16]
  To save your scrag." Then, without delay, [17]
He so prewailed on the treach'rous varmint
  That she was noodled by the Bow St. sarmint  [18]
Then the beaks they grabbed me, and to prison I vas dragged  [19]
  And for fourteen years of my life I vas lagged. [20]

VII

My mot must now be growing old,
  And so am I if the truth be told;
But the only vay to get on in the vorld,
  Is to go with the stream, and however ve're twirld,
To bear all rubs; and ven ve suffer
  To hope for the smooth ven ve feels the rougher,
Though very hard, I confess it appears,
  To be lagged, for a lark, for fourteen years.

"NIX MY DOLL, PALS, FAKE AWAY"  [Notes]
[1834]

[By W. HARRISON AINSWORTH, being Jerry Juniper's chaunt in _Rookwood_.]


In a box of the stone jug I was born, [1]
Of a hempen widow the kid forlorn, [2]
        Fake away! [3]
And my father, as I've heard say,
Was a merchant of capers gay, [4 ]
Who cut his last fling with great applause.
Nix my doll, pals, fake away! [5]
To the time of hearty choke with caper sauce. [6]
        Fake away!
The knucks in quod did my schoolmen play, [7]
        Fake away!
And put me up to the time of day, [8]
Until at last there was none so knowing,
No such sneaksman or buzgloak going, [9]
        Fake away!
Fogles and fawnies soon went their way, [10]
        Fake away!
To the spout with the sneezers in grand array, [11]
No dummy hunter had forks so fly, [12]
No knuckler so deftly, could fake a cly, [13]
  Fake away!
No slourd hoxter my snipes could stay, [14]
  Fake away!
None knap a reader like me in the lay. [15]
Soon then I mounted in swell street-high,
Nix my doll, pals, fake away!
Soon then I mounted in swell street-high.
And sported my flashest toggery, [16]
  Fake away!
Fainly resolved I would make my hay,
  Fake away!
While Mercury's star shed a single ray;
And ne'er was there seen such a dashing prig,
With my strummel faked in the newest twig, [17]
  Fake away!
With my fawnied famms and my onions gay, [18]
  Fake away!
My thimble of ridge and my driz kemesa, [19]
All my togs were so niblike and plash. [20]
Readily the queer screens I then could smash. [21]
  Fake away!
But my nuttiest blowen one fine day,  [22]
  Fake away!
To the beaks did her fancy-man betray, [23]
And thus was I bowled at last,
And into the jug for a lag was cast,
  Fake away!
But I slipped my darbies one morn in May, [24]
And gave to the dubsman a holiday, [25]
And here I am, pals, merry and free,
A regular rollicking romany.  [26]

THE GAME OF HIGH TOBY    [Notes]
[1834]

[By W. HARRISON AINSWORTH in _Rookwood_].


I

Now Oliver puts his black night-cap on, [1]
  And every star its glim is hiding, [2]
And forth to the heath is the scampsman gone, [3]
  His matchless cherry-black prancer riding; [4]
Merrily over the Common, he flies,
  Fast and free as the rush of rocket,
His crape-covered vizard drawn over his eyes,
  His tol by his side and his pops in his pocket. [5]

         _Chorus_.

    Then who can name
    So merry a game,
As the game of all games--high-toby? [6]

II

The traveller hears him, away! away!
  Over the wide, wide heath he scurries;
He heeds not the thunderbolt summons to stay,
  But ever the faster and faster he hurries,

But what daisy-cutter can match that black tit? [7]
  He is caught--he must 'stand and deliver';
Then out with the dummy, and off with the bit, [8]
  Oh! the game of high-toby for ever!

      _Chorus_.

    Then who can name
    So merry a game
As the game of all games--high-toby?

III

Believe me, there is not a game, my brave boys,
  To compare with the game of high-toby;
No rapture can equal the tobyman's joys,  [9]
  To blue devils, blue plumbs give the go-by; [10]
And what if, at length, boys, he come to the crap! [11]
  Even rack punch has _some_ bitter in it,
For the mare-with-three-legs, boys, I care not a rap, [12]
  'Twill be over in less than a minute!

      _Chorus_.

    Then hip, hurrah!
    Fling care away!
Hurrah for the game of high-toby!

THE DOUBLE CROSS  [Notes]
[1834]

[By W. HARRISON AINSWORTH, in _Rookwood_]


I

Though all of us have heard of crost fights,
And certain gains, by certain lost fights;
I rather fancies that its news,
How in a mill, both men should lose; [1]
For vere the odds are thus made even,
It plays the dickens with the steven: [2]
Besides, against all rule they're sinning,
Vere neither has no chance of vinning.
  Ri, tol, lol, etc.

II

Two milling coves, each vide awake,
Vere backed to fight for heavy stake;
But in the mean time, so it vos,
Both kids agreed to play a cross;
Bold came each buffer to the scratch, [3]
To make it look a tightish match;
They peeled in style, and bets were making, [4]
'Tvos six to four, but few were taking.
                 Ri, tol, lol, etc.

III


Quite cautiously the mill began,
For neither knew the other's plan:
Each cull completely in the dark, [5]
Of vot might be his neighbour's mark;
Resolved his fibbing not to mind, [6]
Nor yet to pay him back in kind;
So on each other kept they tout,
And sparred a bit, and dodged about.
              Ri, tol, lol, etc.


IV


Vith mawleys raised, Tom bent his back, [7]
As if to place a heavy thwack;
Vile Jem, with neat left handed stopper,
Straight threatened Tommy with a topper;
'Tis all my eye! no claret flows, [8]
No facers sound--no smashing blows,
Five minutes pass, yet not a hit,
How can it end, pals ?--vait a bit.
                       Ri, tol, lol, etc.

V.

Each cove vos teared with double duty,
To please his backers, yet play booty, [9]
Ven, luckily for Jem, a teller
Vos planted right upon his smeller [10]
Down dropped he, stunned; ven time was called
Seconds in vain the seconds bawled;
The mill is o'er, the crosser crost,
The losers von, the vinners lost.

THE THIEVES' CHAUNT [Notes]
[1836]

(By W. H. SMITH in _The Individual_)


I

There is a nook in the boozing ken, [1]
  Where many a mug I fog, [2]
And the smoke curls gently, while cousin Ben
Keeps filling the pots again and again,
  If the coves have stump'd their hog. [3]

II

The liquors around are diamond bright,
  And the diddle is best of all;  [4]
But I never in liquors took delight,
For liquors I think is all a bite, [5]
  So for heavy wet I call.  [6]

III

The heavy wet in a pewter quart,
  As brown as a badger's hue,
More than Bristol milk or gin, [7]
Brandy or rum, I tipple in,
  With my darling blowen, Sue. [8]

IV

Oh! grunting peck in its eating  [9]
Is a richly soft and savoury thing;
A Norfolk capon is jolly grub [10]
When you wash it down with strength of bub: [11]
But dearer to me Sue's kisses far,
Than grunting peck or other grub are,
And I never funks the lambskin men, [12]
When I sits with her in the boozing ken.

V

Her duds are bob--she's a kinchin crack, [13]
And I hopes as how she'll never back;
For she never lushes dog's-soup or lap, [14]
But she loves my cousin the bluffer's tap. [15]
She's wide-awake, and her prating cheat, [16 ]
For humming a cove was never beat;  [17]
But because she lately nimm'd some tin, [18]
They have sent her to lodge at the King's Head Inn. [19]

THE HOUSE BREAKER'S SONG     [Notes]
[c. 1838]

[By G. W. M. REYNOLDS in _Pickwick Abroad_].


I

I ne'er was a nose, for the reg'lars came [1]
  Whenever a pannie was done:-- [2]
Oh! who would chirp to dishonour his name,
And betrays his pals in a nibsome game [3]
  To the traps?--Not I for one!  [4]
Let nobs in the fur trade hold their jaw, [5]
  And let the jug be free:--  [6]
Let Davy's dust and a well-faked claw [7]
For fancy coves be the only law, [8]
And a double-tongued squib to keep in awe [9]
  The chaps that flout at me!

II

From morn till night we'll booze a ken, [10]
  And we'll pass the bingo round; [11]
At dusk we'll make our lucky, and then,  [12]
With our nags so fresh, and our merry men,
  We'll scour the lonely ground.
And if the swell resist our "Stand!"
  We'll squib without a joke;  [13]
For I'm snigger'd if we will be trepanned [14]
By the blarneying jaw of a knowing hand,
And thus be lagged to a foreign land,
  Or die by an artichoke. [15]

III

But should the traps be on the sly,
  For a change we'll have a crack;  [16]
The richest cribs shall our wants supply-- [17]
Or we'll knap a fogle with fingers fly, [18]
  When the swell one turns his back. [19]
The flimsies we can smash as well, [20]
  Or a ticker deftly prig:--  [21]
But if ever a pal in limbo fell,  [22]
He'd sooner be scragg'd at once than tell; [23]
Though the hum-box patterer talked of hell, [24]
  And the beak wore his nattiest wig. [25]

"THE FAKING BOY TO THE CRAP IS GONE"    [Notes]
[1841]

[By BON GAULTIER in _Tait's Edinburgh Magazine_].


I

The faking boy to the crap is gone, [1]
At the nubbing-cheat you'll find him; [2]
The hempen cord they have girded on,
And his elbows pinned behind him.
"Smash my glim," cries the reg'lar card, [3]
"Though the girl you love betrays you,
Don't split, but die both game and hard,
And grateful pals shall praise you."

II

The bolt it fell,--a jerk, a strain!
The sheriff's fled asunder;
The faking-boy ne'er spoke again,
For they pulled his legs from under.
And there he dangles on the tree,
That sort of love and bravery!
Oh, that such men should victims be
Of law, and law's vile knavery.

THE NUTTY BLOWEN                 [Notes]
[1841]

[By BON GAULTIER in _Taits Edinburgh Magazine_].


I

She wore a rouge like roses, the night when first we met,
Her lovely mug was smiling o'er mugs of heavy wet; [1]
Her red lips had the fullness, her voice the husky tone,
That told her drink was of a kind where water is unknown.
I saw her but a moment, yet methinks I see her now,
With the bloom of borrowed flowers upon her cheek and brow.

II

A pair of iron darbies, when next we met, she wore, [2]
The expression of her features was more thoughtful than before;
And, standing by her side, was he who strove with might and main
To soothe her leaving that dear land she ne'er might see again.
I saw her but a moment, yet methinks I see her now,
As she dropped the judge a curtsey, and he made her a bow.

III

And once again I see that brow no idle rouge is there,
The dubsman's ruthless hand has cropped her once luxurious hair; [3]
She teases hemp in solitude, and there is no one near,
To press her hand within his own, and call for ginger-beer.
I saw her but a moment, yet methinks I see her now,
With the card and heckle in her hand, a-teasing of that tow.

THE FAKER'S NEW TOAST         [Notes]
[1841]

[By BON GAULTIER ("Nimming Ned") in _Tait's Edinburgh Magazine_]


I

Come, all ye jolly covies, vot faking do admire, [1]
And pledge them British authors who to our line aspire;
Who, if they were not gemmen born, like us had kicked at trade,
And every one had turned him out a genuine fancy blade, [2]
  And a trump.

II

'Tis them's the boys as knows the vorld, 'tis them as knows mankind,
And vould have picked his pocket too, if Fortune (vot is blind)
Had not to spite their genius, stuck them in a false position,
Vere they can only write about, not execute their mission,
  Like a trump.

III

If they goes on as they're begun, things soon will come about,
And ve shall be the upper class, and turn the others out;
Their laws ve'll execute ourselves, and raise their hevelation,
That's tit for tat, for they'd make that the only recreation
  Of a trump.

IV

But ketch us! only vait a bit, and ve shall be their betters;
For vitch our varmest thanks is due unto the men of letters,
Who, good 'uns all, have showed us up in our own proper light,
And proved ve prigs for glory, and all becos it's right [3]
  In a trump.

V

'Tis ve as sets the fashion: Jack Sheppard is the go [4]
And every word of 'Nix my dolls' the finest ladies know;
And ven a man his vortin'd make, vy, vot d'ye think's his vay?
He does vot ve vere used to do--he goes to Botany Bay
  Like a trump.

VI

Then fill your glasses, dolly palls, vy should they be neglected,
As does their best to helewate the line as ve's selected?
To them as makes the Crackman's life, the subject of their story, [5]
To Ainsworth, and to Bullvig, and to Reynolds be the glory, [6]
  Jolly trumps.

MY MOTHER    [Notes]
[1841]

[By BON GAULTIER in _Tait's Edinburgh Magazine_].


I

Who, when a baby, lank and thin,
I called for pap and made a din,
Lulled me with draughts of British gin?--
                               My mother.

II

When I've been out upon the spree,
And not come home till two or three,
Who was it then would wallop me?--
                          My mother.

III

Who, when she met a heavy swell, [1]
Would ease him of his wipe so well, [2]
And kiss me not to go and tell ?--
                              My mother.

IV

Who took me from my infant play,
And taught me how to fake away.
And put me up to the time of day?--  [3]
                             My mother.

V

Who'd watch me sleeping in my chair,
And slily to my fob repair, [4]
And leave me not a mopus there?-- [5]
                             My mother.

VI

Who, as beneath her care I grew,
Taught my young mind a thing or two,
Especially the flats to do?-- [6]
                            My mother.

VII

I'm blessed if ever I did see,
So regular a trump as she:
I own my virtues all to thee,--
                            My mother.

VIII

So hand, my pals, the drink about,
My story and my glass are out,
A bumper, boys, and with me shout--
                            My mother.

THE HIGH-PADS FROLIC  [Notes]
[1841]

[By LEMAN REDE, being Kit's and Adelgitha's Duet in _Sixteen String
Jack_].


_Ade._ Crissy odsbuds, I'll on with my duds, [1]
  And over the water we'll flare;
_Kit._ Coaches and prads, lasses and lads, [2]
  And fiddlers will be there.
_Ade._ There beauty blushes bright,
_Kit._ The punch is hot and strong,
_Both._And there we'll whisk it, frisk it, whisk it,
  Skip it, and trip it along!

II

_Ade._ There's Charley Rattan, and natty Jack Rann,
  And giant-like Giles McGhee;
There's Sidle so slim, and flare-away Tim,
  And all of them doat on me.
_Kit._ Hadelgitha--platonically, Christopher!
_Ade._ But Charley, and Jack, and Tim,
              In vain may exert their wit.
            For still I'll dance it, prance it, dance it,
              Flaring away with Kit!

II

_Kit._ There's frollicking Kate, and rollicking Bet,
  And slammerkin Sall so tall,
And leary-eyed Poll, and blue-eyed Moll--
  Blow me, I love them all!
Christopher--platonically, Hadelgitha!
But Winny, not Jenny, nor Sue,
 Shall wean this heart from thee--
So thus I'll trip it, lip it, trip it,
 Trip it with Hadelgitha!

IV

_Kit._ The morning may dawn as sure as you're born,
_Ade._ Will find us dancing alone
_Kit._ I'll get a hack, be off in a crack, [3]
_Ade._ An elegant Darby and Joan!
How'll the vulgarians stare
 As they see you sportingly!
_Both._For none can splash it, dash it, splash it,
_Crissy Addy_ little you and I.

THE DASHY, SPLASHY.... LITTLE STRINGER  [Notes]
[1841]

[By LEMAN REDE, being Kit's Song in _Sixteen-String Jack_].


I

A cloudy night, and pretty hard it blow'd,
  The dashy, splashy, leary little stringer, [1]
Mounted his roan, and took the road--
                                   Phililoo!

"My Lord Cashall's on the road to-night,
Down with the lads, make my lord alight--
  Ran dan row de dow, on we go!"
         _Chorus_.--Ran, dan, etc.


II

"You horrid wretch," said my Lord to Rann--
  The dashy, splashy, leary little stringer--
"How dare you rob a gentleman?"
                                     Phililoo!

Says Jack, says he, with his knowing phiz, [2]
"I ain't very pertic'lar who it is!
   Ran dan row de dow, on we go!"
             _Chorus_.--Ran, dan, etc.

III

Ve collar'd the blunt, started off for town, [3]
  With the dashy, splashy, leary little stringer,
Horses knock'd up, men knock'd down--
                                  Phililoo!

A lady's carriage we next espied,
I collar'd the blunt, Jack jumped inside,
   Ran dan row de dow, on we go!
            _Chorus_.--Ran, dan, etc.


IV

Jack took off his hat, with a jaunty air--
  The dashy, splashy, leary little stringer--
And he kiss'd the lips of the lady fair--
                                     Phililoo!

She sigh'd a sigh, and her looks said plain,
I don't care much if I'm robb'd again!
   Ran dan row de dow, on we go!
                  _Chorus_.--Ran, dan, etc.

THE BOULD YEOMAN                       [Notes]
[1842]

[By PIERCE EGAN in _Captain Macheath_].


I

A chant I'll tip to you about a High-pad pal so down, [1]
With his pops, and high-bred prad which brought to him renown; [2]
On the road he cut a dash, to him 'twas delight!
And if culls would not surrender, he shewed the kiddies fight! [3]
  With his pops so bright and airy,
  And his prad just like a fairy,
  He went out to nab the gold! [4]
    Derry down, down, derry down,

II

He met a bould yeoman, and bid him for to stand;
"If I do, I'm damn'd!" said he, "although you cut it grand.
I'm an old English farmer, and do not me provoke
I've a cudgel, look ye here, it's a prime tough bit of oak!
  And I'll give you some gravy, [5]
  Of that I'll take my davy, [6]
  If you try to prig my gold  [7]
    Derry down."


III

Then the High-toby gloque drew his cutlass so fine;
Says he to the farmer, "you or I for the shine!"
And to it they went both, like two Grecians of old,
Cutting, slashing, up and down, and all for the gold!
  'Twas cut for cut while it did last,
  Thrashing, licking, hard and fast,
  Hard milling for the gold. [8]
    Derry down.


IV

The High-pad quickly cut the farmer's towel in twain-- [9]
Pulled out his barking-iron to send daylight through his brain; [10]
But said he I will not down you, if you will but disburse
Your rowdy with me, yeoman--I'm content to whack your purse! [11]
  Down with the dust, and save your life, [12]
  Your consent will end our strife,
  Ain't your life worth more than gold?
    Derry down.

V

Hand up the pewter, farmer, you shall have a share [13]
A kindness, for a toby gloque, you must say is rare;
That's right--tip up the kelter, it will make my bones amends, [14]
And wherever we may meet, farmer, we'll be the best of friends!
  So mount your trotter and away, [15]
  And if you ever come this way,
  Take better care of your gold!
     Derry down.


VI

Now listen to me, lads, and always you'll do well,
Empty every clie of duke, commoner, or swell; [16]
But if you stop a game cove, who has little else than pluck, [17]
Do not clean him out, and you'll never want for luck. [18]
  So High-pads drink my toast,
  Let honour be our boast,
  And never pluck a poor cull of his gold.
    Derry down.

[By PIERCE EGAN in _Captain Macheath_].


I

My brave brother troopers, slap-up in the abode,
Come listen unto me while I chant about "the Road";
Oh prick up your list'ners if you are fond of fun [1]
A bridle-cull's the hero, and his little pop-gun. [2]
  Fal, de, rol! lal! lal! la!

II

One morning early he went, this rollicking blade, [3]
To pick the blunt up, and he met a nice young maid; [4]
"I'll not rob you," said he, "and so you needn't bunk: [5]
But she lammas'd off in style, of his pop-gun afunk [6]
  Fal, de, rol! lal! lal! la!"

III

Then up came a stage-coach, and thus the gloque did say, [7]
I'm sorry for to stop you, but you must hear my lay;
"Come, stand and deliver! if not, sure as the sun,
Your journey I will stop with my little pop-gun."
  Fal, de, rol! lol! lol!

IV

"Tis by these little lays a High-padsman he thrives, [8]
"Oh take all our rhino, but pray spare our lives!" [9]
Cry the passengers who anxious all are for to run,
Frightened nigh to death by his little pop-gun."
  Fol, de, rol.

Then, my blades, when you're bush'd, and must have the swag, [10]
Walk into tattlers, shiners, and never fear the lag; [11]
Then patter to all spicey, and tip 'em lots of fun, [12]
And blunt you'll never want while you've got a pop-gun. [13]
  Fol, de, rol! la!

JACK FLASHMAN	[Notes]
[1842]

[By PIERCE EGAN in _Captain Macheath_].

I

Jack Flashman was a prig so bold,
Who sighed for nothen but the gold;
For sounding, frisking any clie, [1]
Jack was the lad, and never shy.
Fol, de, rol.


II

Jack long was on the town, a teazer; [2]
A spicy blade for wedge or sneezer; [3]
Could turn his fives to anything  [4]
Nap a reader, or filch a ring. [5]
Fol, de, rol.


III

Jack was all game, and never slack, [6]
In the darky tried the crack;  [7]
Frisk'd the lobby and the swag;
"I'm fly to every move," his brag. [8]
Fol, de, rol.

IV

But Jack, at last, got too knowen--
Was made a flat by his blowen! [9]
She peached, so got him into trouble. [10]
And then, tipp'd poor Jack the double! [11]
Fol, de, rol.

V

Jack left the jug right mer-ri-ly, [12]
And vent and black'd his doxy's eye! [13]
Saying--look, marm, when next you split,
I'll finish you with a rummy hit!
Fol, de, rol.

VI

My blades, before my chaunt I end, [14]
 Here the rag-sauce of a friend; [15]
Ne'er trust to any fancy jade,
For all their chaff is only trade!
Fol, de, rol.

VII

Let all their gammon be resisted;
Vithout you vishes to get twisted! [16]
And never nose upon yourself-- [17]
You then are sure to keep your pelf.
Fol, de, riddle.

MISS DOLLY TRULL   [Notes]
[1842]

[By PIERCE EGAN in _Captain Macheath_].


I

  Of all the mots in this here jug, [1]
    There's none like saucy Dolly;
  And but to view her dimber mug [2]
    Is e'er excuse for folly.
  She runs such precious cranky rigs
    With pinching wedge and lockets [3]
  Yet she's the toast of all the prigs
    Though stealing hearts and pockets.

II

  Just twig Miss Dolly at a hop--  [4]
    She tries to come the graces!  [5]
  To gain her end she will not stop
    And all the swells she chases.
  She ogles, nods, and patters flash [6]
    To ev'ry flatty cully [7]
  Until she frisks him, at a splash  [8]
    Of rhino, wedge, and tully.  [9]

THE BY-BLOW OF THE JUG    [Notes]
[1842]

[By PIERCE EGAN in _Captain Macheath_].


I

In Newgate jail the jolly kid was born-- [1]
Infamy he suck'd without any scorn!
His mammy his father did not know,
But that's no odds--Jack was a by-blow!
Foddy, loddy, high O.

II

Scarcely had Jack got on his young pins, [2]
When his mammy put him up to some very bad sins,
And she taught him soon to swear and lie,
And to have a finger in every pie.
Foddy, loddy, high O.

III

His mammy was downy to every rig,-- [3]
Before he could read she made him a prig; [4]
Very soon she larn'd Jack to make a speak
And he toddled out on the morning sneak [5]
Foddy, loddy, high O.


IV

Jack had a sharp-looking eye to ogle, [6]
And soon he began to nap the fogle!  [7]
And ever anxious to get his whack--
When scarcely ripe, he went on the crack. [8]
             Foddy, loddy, high O.

V

"Now, my chick," says she, "you must take the road
'Tis richer than the finest abode,
For watches, purses, and lots of the gold--
A scampsman, you know, must always be bold." [9]
           Foddy, loddy, high O.

VI

His mother then did give Jack some advice,
To her son a thief, who was not o'er nice;
Says she--"Fight your way, Jack, and stand the brunt,
You're of no use, my child, without the blunt, [10]
            Foddy, loddy, high O."

VII

"Then keep it up, Jack, with rare lots of fun.
A short life, perhaps, but a merry one;
Your highway dodges may then live in fame,
Cheat miss-Fortune, and be sure to die game."
             Foddy, loddy, high O.

VIII

"In spite of bad luck, don't be a grumbler;
If you are finished off from a tumbler! [11]
But to the end of your life, cut a shine,
You're not the first man got into a line."
             Foddy, loddy, high O.

THE CADGER'S BALL              [Notes]
[1852]

[From JOHN LABERN'S _Popular Comic Song Book_. Tune--_Joe
Buggins._].

I

Oh, what a spicy flare-up, tear-up,
  Festival Terpsickory,
Was guv'd by the genteel cadgers
  In the famous Rookery.
As soon as it got vind, however,
  Old St Giles's vos to fall--
They all declar'd, so help their never,
  They'd vind up vith a stunnin' ball!
    Tol, lol lol, etc.

II

Jack Flipflap took the affair in hand, sirs--
  Who understood the thing complete--
He'd often danced afore the public,
  On the boards, about the streets.
Old Mother Swankey, she consented
  To lend her lodging-house for nix-- [1]
Say's she, 'The crib comes down to-morrow,
  So, go it, just like beans and bricks.' [2]
    Tol, lol lol, etc.

III

The night arrived for trotter-shaking-- [3]
  To Mother Swankey's snoozing-crib; [4]
Each downy cadger was seen taking
  His bit of muslin, or his rib. [5]
Twelve candles vos stuck into turnips,
  Suspended from the ceiling queer--
Bunn's blaze of triumph was all pickles
  To this wegetable shandileer.
    Tol, lol lol, etc.

IV

Ragged Jack, wot chalks 'Starvation !'
  Look'd quite fat and swellish there--
While Dick, wot 'dumbs it' round the nation,
  Had all the jaw among the fair.
Limping Ned wot brought his duchess,
  At home had left his wooden pegs--
And Jim, wot cadges it on crutches,
  Vos the nimblest covey on his legs.
    Tol, lol lol, etc.

V

The next arrival was old Joe Burn,
  Wot does the fits to Natur chuff--
And Fogg, And Fogg, wot's blind each day in Ho'born,
  Saw'd his way there clear enough,
Mr. Sinniwating Sparrow,
  In corduroys span new and nice,
Druv up in his pine-apple barrow,
  Which he used to sell a win a slice. [6]
    Tol, lol lol, etc.

VI

The ball was open'd by fat Mary,
  Togg'd out in book muslin pure, [7]
And Saucy Sam, surnamed 'The Lary,'
  Who did the '_Minuit-on-a-squre.'_
While Spifflicating Charley Coker,
  And Jane of the Hatchet-face divine,
Just did the Rowdydowdy Poker,
  And out of Greasy took the shine. [8]
    Tol, lol lol, etc.


VII

The Sillywarious next was done in
  Tip-top style just as it should,
By Muster and Missus Mudfog, stunning,
  Whose hair curled like a bunch of wood.
The folks grinn'd all about their faces,
  'Cos Mudfog--prince of flashy bucks--
Had on a pair of pillow Cases,
  Transmogrified slap into ducks!
    Tol, lol lol, etc.

VIII

The celebrated Pass de Sandwich
  To join in no one could refuse--
Six bushels on 'em came in, and wich
  Wanish'd in about two two's.
The Gatter Waltz next followed arter-- [9]
  They lapp'd it down, right manful-ly, [10]
Until Joe Guffin and his darter,
  Was in a state of Fourpen-ny!
     Tol, lol lol, etc.

IX

Next came the Pass de Fascination
  Betwixt Peg Price and Dumby Dick--
But Peg had sich a corporation,
  He dropp'd her like a red hot brick.
The company was so enraptur'd,
  They _buckets_ of vall flowers threw--
But one chap flung a bunch of turnips,
  Which nearly split Dick's nut in two.
     Tol, lol lol, etc.

X

The dose now set to gallopading,
  And stamp'd with all their might and main--
They thump'd the floor so precious hard-in,
  It split the ancient crib in twain,  [11]
Some pitch'd in the road, bent double--
  Some was smash'd with bricks--done brown--
So the cadgers saved 'The Crown' the trouble
  Of sending coves to pull it down.
     Tol, lol lol, etc.

"DEAR BILL, THIS STONE-JUG"  [Notes]
[1857]

[From _Punch_, 31 Jan., p. 49. Being an Epistle from Toby
Cracksman, in Newgate, to Bill Sykes].


I

Dear Bill, this stone-jug at which flats dare to rail, [1]
(From which till the next Central sittings I hail),
Is still the same snug, free-and-easy old hole,
Where Macheath met his blowens, and Wild floor'd his bowl [2]
In a ward with one's pals, not locked up in a cell, [3]
To an old hand like me it's a family hotel. [4]

II

In the dayrooms the cuffins we queers at our ease, [5]
And at Darkmans we run the rig just as we please, [6]
There's your peck and your lush, hot and reg'lar each day. [7]
All the same if you work, all the same if you play
But the lark's when a goney up with us they shut  [8]
As ain't up to our lurks, our flash patter, and smut; [9]

III

But soon in his eye nothing green would remain,
He knows what's o'clock when he comes out again.
And the next time he's quodded so downy and snug, [10]
He may thank us for making him fly to the jug. [11]
But here comes a cuffin--who cuts short my tale,
It's agin rules is screevin' to pals out o' gaol. [12]

[The following postscript seems to have been
  added when the Warder had passed.]

IV

For them coves in Guildhall, and that blessed Lord Mayor,
Prigs on their four bones should chop whiners I swear: [13]
That long over Newgit their Worships may rule,
As the high-toby, mob, crack and screeve model school: [14]
For if Guv'ment wos here, not the Alderman's Bench,
Newgit soon 'ud be bad as 'the Pent,' or 'the Tench'. [15]

THE LEARY MAN   [Notes]
[1857]

[From _The Vulgar Tongue_, by DUCANGE ANGLICUS].


I

Of ups and downs I've felt the shocks
Since days of bats and shuttlecocks,
And allcumpaine and Albert-rocks,
  When I the world began;
And for these games I often sigh
Both marmoney and Spanish-fly,
And flying kites, too, in the sky,
  For which I've often ran.

II

But by what I've seen, and where I've been,
I've always found it so,
That if you wish to learn to live
  Too much you cannot know.
For you must now be wide-awake,
If a living you would make,
So I'll advise what course to take
  To be a Leary Man.

II

Go first to costermongery,
To every fakement get a-fly, [1]
And pick up all their slangery,
  But let this be your plan;
Put up with no Kieboshery, [2]
But look well after poshery, [3]
And cut teetotal sloshery, [4]
  And get drunk when you can.

IV

And when you go to spree about,
Let it always be your pride
To have a white tile on your nob [5 ]
  And bull-dog by your side
Your fogle you must flashly tie  [6]
Each word must patter flashery, [7]
And hit cove's head to smashery,
  To be a Leary Man.

V

To Covent Garden or Billingsgate
You of a morn must not be late,
But your donkey drive at a slashing rate,
  And first be if you can.
From short pipe you must your bacca blow
And if your donkey will not go,
To lick him you must not be slow
  But well his hide must tan.

VI

The fakement conn'd by knowing rooks
Must be well known to you,
And if you come to fibbery,
  You must mug one or two.
Then go to St Giles's rookery, [8]
And live up some strange nookery,
Of no use domestic cookery,
  To be a Leary Man.

VII

Then go to pigeon fancery
And know each breed by quiz of eye,
Bald-heads from skin-'ems by their fly,
  Go wrong you never can.
All fighting coves too you must know
Ben Caunt as well as Bendigo,
And to each mill be sure to go,
  And be one of the van.

VIII

Things that are found before they're lost,
Be always first to find.
Restore dogs for a pound or two
  You'll do a thing that's kind,
And you must sport a blue billy,
Or a yellow wipe tied loosily [9]
Round your scrag for bloaks to see [10]
  That you're a Leary Man

IX

At knock-'em-downs and tiddlywink,
To be a sharp you must not shrink,
But be a brick and sport your chink [11]
  To win must be your plan.
And set-toos and Cock-fighting
Are things you must take delight in,
And always try to be right in
  And every kidment scan.

X

And bullying and chaffing too,
To you should be well known,
Your nob be used to bruisery, [12]
  And hard as any stone.
Put the kiebosh on the dibbery,
Know a Joey from a tibbery,
And now and then have a black eye,
  To be a Leary Man.

XI

To fairs and races go must you,
And get in rows and fights a few,
And stopping out all night it's true
  Must often be your plan.
And as through the world you budgery,
Get well awake to fudgery,
And rub off every grudgery,
  And do the best you can.

XII

But mummery and slummery
You must keep in your mind,
For every day, mind what I say,
  Fresh fakements you will find.
But stick to this while you can crawl.
To stand 'till you're obliged to fall,
And when you're wide awake to all
  You'll be a Leary Man.

"A HUNDRED STRETCHES HENCE"      [Notes]
[1859]

[From _The Vocabulum: or Rogues Lexicon_, by G. W. MATSELL, New
York].


I

Oh! where will be the culls of the bing  [1]
  A hundred stretches hence? [2]
The bene morts who sweetly sing, [3]
  A hundred stretches hence?
The autum-cacklers, autum-coves, [4]
  The jolly blade who wildly roves; [5]
And where the buffer, bruiser, blowen, [6]
And all the cops, and beaks so knowin, [7]
  A hundred stretches hence?

II

And where the swag so bleakly pinched [8]
  A hundred stretches hence?
The thimbles, slangs, and danglers filched, [9]
  A hundred stretches hence?
The chips, the fawneys, chatty-feeders, [10]
  The bugs, the boungs, and well-filled readers; [11]
And where the fence, and snoozing ken, [12]
With all the prigs and lushing men, [13]
  A hundred stretches hence?


III

Played out they lay, it will be said
  A hundred stretches hence;
With shovels they were put to bed  [14]
  A hundred stretches since!
Some rubbed to wit had napped a winder, [15]
  And some were scragged and took a blinder, [16]
Planted the swag and lost to sight, [17]
We'll bid them one and all good-night,
  A hundred stretches hence.

THE CHICKALEARY COVE   [Notes]

I

I'm a 'Chickaleary bloke' with my one, two, three, [1]
  Whitechapel was the village I was born in,
For to get me on the hop, or on my tibby drop, [2]
 You must wake up very early in the morning.
I have a rorty gal, also a knowing pal, [3]
 And merrily together we jog on,
I doesn't care a flatch, as long as I've a tach, [4]
 Some pannum for my chest, and a tog on. [5]

  Built on a plan werry naughty,

  And the vestat with the bins so rorty, [8]
My tailor serves you well, from a perger to a swell, [9]
  At Groves's you're safe to make a sure pitch, [10]
For ready yenom down, there ain't a shop in town, [11]
  Can lick Groves in The Cut as well as Shoreditch. [12]
    I'm a Chickaleary bloke, etc.

III

Off to Paris I shall go, to show a thing or two
  To the dipping blokes what hangs about the caffes, [13]
How to do a cross-fam, for a super, or a slang, [14]
  And to bustle them grand'armes I'd give the office:
Now my pals I'm going to slope, see you soon again, I hope,
  My young woman is awaiting, so be quick;
Now join in a chyike, the jolly we all like, [15]
  I'm off with a party to the Vic.

'ARRY AT A POLITICAL PICNIC
[By T Milliken in _Punch_, 11 Oct.]


DEAR CHARLIE.

I

'Ow are yer, my ribstone? Seems scrumtious to write the old name.
I 'ave quite lost the ran of you lately. Bin playing some dark little game? [1]
I'm keeping mine hup as per usual, fust in the pick of the fun,
For wherever there's larks on the tappy there's 'Arry as sure as a gun.

II

The latest new lay's Demonstrations. You've heard on 'em, Charlie, no doubt,
For they're at 'em all over the shop. I 'ave 'ad a rare bustle about.
All my Saturday arfs are devoted to Politics. Fancy, old chump,
Me doing the sawdusty reglar, and follering swells on the stump! [2]

III

But, bless yer, my bloater, it isn't all chin-music, votes, and 'Ear! 'ear!' [3]
Or they wouldn't catch me on the ready, or nail me for ninepence. No fear!
Percessions I've got a bit tired of, hoof-padding and scrouging's dry rot, [4]
But Political Picnics mean sugar to them as is fly to wot's wot.

IV

Went to one on 'em yesterday, Charlie; a reglar old up and down lark.
The Pallis free gratis, mixed up with a old country fair in a park,
And Rosherville Gardens chucked in, with a dash of the Bean Feast will do,
To give you some little idear of our day with Sir Jinks Bottleblue.

               V

Make much of us, Charlie? Lor bless you, we might ha' bin blooming Chinese
A-doing the rounds at the 'Ealthries. 'Twas regular go as you please.
Lawn-tennis, quoits, cricket, and dancing for them as must be on the shove,

But I preferred pecking and prowling, and spotting the mugs making love.

VI

Don't ketch me a-slinging my legs about arter a beast of a ball
At ninety degrees in the shade or so, Charlie, old chap, not at all.
Athletics 'aint 'ardly my form, and a cutaway coat and tight bags
Are the species of togs for yours truly, and lick your loose 'flannels' to rags.

VII

So I let them as liked do a swelter; I sorntered about on the snap.
Rum game this yer Politics, Charlie, seems arf talkee-talkee and trap.
Jest fancy old Bluebottle letting the 'multitood' pic-nic and lark,
And make Battersea Park of his pleasure-grounds, Bathelmy Fair of his park!

VIII

'To show his true love for the People!' sezs one vote-of-thanking tall-talker,
And wosn't it rude of a bloke as wos munching a bun to cry 'Walker!'
I'm Tory right down to my boots, at a price, and I bellered "'Ear, ear!'
But they don't cop yours truly with chaff none the more, my dear Charlie, no fear!"

IX

Old Bottleblue tipped me his flipper, and 'oped I'd 'refreshed,' and all that. [10]
'Wy rather,' sez I, 'wot do you think ?' at which he stared into his 'at,
And went a bit red in the gills. Must ha' thought me a muggins, old man, [11]
To ask sech a question of 'Arry--as though grabbing short was his plan.

X

I went the rounds proper, I tell yer; 'twas like the free run of a Bar,
And Politics wants lots o' wetting. Don't ketch me perched up on a car,
Or 'olding a flag-pole no more. No, percessions, dear boy, ain't my fad,
But Political Picnics with fireworks, and plenty of swiz ain't 'arf bad.

XI

The palaver was sawdust and treacle. Old Bottleblue buzzed for a bit,
And a sniffy young Wiscount in barnacles landed wot 'e thought a 'it;
Said old Gladstone wos like Simpson's weapon, a bit of a hass and all jor,
When a noisy young Rad in a wideawake wanted to give him what for! [12]

XII

Yah! boo! Turn 'im hout!' sings yours truly, a-thinkin' the fun was at 'and,
But, bless yer! 'twas only a sputter. I can't say the meeting looked grand.
Five thousand they reckoned us, Charlie, but if so I guess the odd three
Were a-spooning about in the halley's, or lappin' up buns and Bohea.

XIII

The band and the 'opping wos prime though, and 'Arry in course wos all there.
I 'ad several turns with a snappy young party with stror coloured 'air.
Her name she hinfonned me wos Polly, and wen in my 'appiest style,
I sez, 'Polly is nicer than Politics!' didn't she colour and smile?

XIV

We got back jest in time for the Fireworks, a proper flare-up, and no kid,
Which finished that day's Demonstration, an' must 'ave cost many a quid.
Wot fireworks and park-feeds do Demonstrate, Charlie, I'm blest if I see,
And I'm blowed if I care a brass button, so long as I get a cheap spree.

XV

The patter's all bow-wow, of course, but it goes with the buns and the beer.
If it pleases the Big-wigs to spout, wy it don't cost bus nothink to cheer.
Though they ain't got the 'ang of it, Charlie, the toffs ain't--no go and no spice!
Why, I'd back Barney Crump at our Singsong to lick 'em two times out o' twice!

XVI

Still I'm all for the Lords and their lot, Charlie. Rads are my 'error, you know.
Change R into C and you've got 'em, and 'Arry 'ates anythink low.
So if Demonstrations means skylarks, and lotion as much as you'll carry,
These 'busts of spontanyous opinion' may reckon all round upon 'Arry.

Rum coves that relieve us [1]
Of clunkers and pieces, [2]

And noble contrivers
Not sold to the beaks  [6]

Concoctin' deceivers,
Chaps as reap like their own
What by tothers were sown;

Of bosh by the acres,
These muck-worms of trash
Cut, oh, a great dash.

Since, to cut it still fatter,
By 'ook and by crook
Ve've got up this book.

VI

Tell ye 'ow? Vy in rum kens, [10]
In flash cribs and slum dens, [11]

'Mong the doocedest sorts;

Or Mag and 'er Billie,

Their illigant clack.  [12]

From vaxy old codgers,  [13]
From the blowens ve got  [14]
Soon to know vot is vot.

VILLON'S GOOD-NIGHT
[1887]

You bible-sharps that thump on tubs, [1]
You lurkers on the Abram-sham, [2]
You sponges miking round the pubs, [3]
You flymy titters fond of flam, [4]
You judes that clobber for the stramm, [5]
You ponces good at talking tall,
With fawneys on your dexter famm-- [6]
A mot's good-night to one and all! [7]

II

Likewise you molls that flash your bubs [8]
For swells to spot and stand you sam, [9]
You bleeding bonnets, pugs, and subs,
You swatchel-coves that pitch and slam.  [10]
You magsmen bold that work the cram,  [11]
You flats and joskins great and small,
Gay grass-widows and lawful-jam--  [12]
A mot's good-night to one and all!

III

For you, you coppers, narks, and dubs, [13]
Who pinched me when upon the snam, [14]
And gave me mumps and mulligrubs  [15]
With skilly and swill that made me clam, [16]
At you I merely lift my gam-- [17]
I drink your health against the wall! [18]
That is the sort of man I am,
A mot's good-night to one and all!

_The Farewell_.

Paste 'em, and larrup 'em, and lamm!
Give Kennedy, and make 'em crawl!  [19]
I do not care one bloody damn,
A mot's good-night to one and all.

VILLON'S STRAIGHT TIP TO ALL CROSS COVES  [Notes]
[1887]

[By WILLIAM ERNEST HENLEY].


_'Tout aux tavernes et aux filles'_

I

Suppose you screeve, or go cheap-jack? [1]
  Or fake the broads? or fig a nag?
Or thimble-rig? or knap a yack?
  Or pitch a snide? or smash a rag?
  Suppose you duff? or nose and lag?
Or get the straight, and land your pot?
  How do you melt the multy swag?
Booze and the blowens cop the lot.

II

Fiddle, or fence, or mace, or mack;
  Or moskeneer, or flash the drag;
Dead-lurk a crib, or do a crack;
  Pad with a slang, or chuck a fag;
  Bonnet, or tout, or mump and gag;
Rattle the tats, or mark the spot
  You cannot bank a single stag:
Booze and the blowens cop the lot.

III

Suppose you try a different tack,
  And on the square you flash your flag?
At penny-a-lining make your whack,
  Or with the mummers mug and gag?
  For nix, for nix the dibbs you bag
At any graft, no matter what!
  Your merry goblins soon stravag:
Booze and the blowens cop the lor.

_The Moral._

It's up-the-spout and Charley-Wag
  With wipes and tickers and what not!
Until the squeezer nips your scrag,
  Booze and the blowens cop the lot.

CULTURE IN THE SLUMS
[1887]

[By WILLIAM ERNEST HENLEY: "Inscribed to an intense poet"].


I. _Rondeau._

I

"O crikey, Bill!" she ses to me, she ses.
"Look sharp," ses she, "with them there sossiges.
Yea! sharp with them there bags of mysteree! [1]
For lo!" she ses, "for lo! old pal," ses she, [2]
"I'm blooming peckish, neither more nor less." [3]

II

Was it not prime--I leave you all to guess
How prime! to have a jude in love's distress  [4]
Come spooning round, and murmuring balmilee,  [5]
      "O crikey, Bill!"

III

For in such rorty wise doth Love express  [6]
His blooming views, and asks for your address,
And makes it right, and does the gay and free.
I kissed her--I did so! And her and me
Was pals. And if that ain't good business.
      O crikey, Bill!

II. _Villanelle_.

I

Now ain't they utterly too--too? [7]
(She ses, my Missus mine, ses she),
Them flymy little bits of Blue. [8]

II

Joe, just you kool 'em--nice and skew [9]
Upon our old meogginee,
Now ain't they utterly too-too?

III

They're better than a pot'n a screw,
They're equal to a Sunday spree,
Them flymy little bits of Blue!

IV

Suppose I put 'em up the flue, [10]
And booze the profits, Joe? Not me. [11]
Now ain't they utterly too-too ?

V

I do the 'Igh Art fake, I do.
Joe, I'm consummate; and I _see_
Them flymy little bits of Blue.

VI

Which, Joe, is why I ses to you--
AEsthetic-like, and limp, and free--
Now ain't they utterly too-too,
Them flymy little bits of Blue?

III. _Ballade_.

I

I often does a quiet read
At Booty Shelley's poetry; [12]
I thinks that Swinburne at a screed
Is really almost too-too fly;
At Signor Vagna's harmony  [13]
I likes a merry little flutter;
I've had at Pater many a shy;
In fact, my form's the Bloomin' Utter.

II

My mark's a tidy little feed,
And 'Enery Irving's gallery,
To see old 'Amlick do a bleed,
And Ellen Terry on the die,
Or Franky's ghostes at hi-spy,
And parties carried on a shutter [14]
Them vulgar Coupeaus is my eye!
In fact, my form's the Bloomin' Utter.


III

The Grosvenor's nuts--it is, indeed!
I goes for 'Olman 'Unt like pie.
It's equal to a friendly lead  [15]
To see B. Jones's judes go by.
Stanhope he makes me fit to cry,
Whistler he makes me melt like butter,
Strudwick he makes me flash my cly--  [16]
In fact, my form's the Bloomin' Utter.

_Envoy_.

I'm on for any Art that's 'Igh!
I talks as quite as I can splutter;
I keeps a Dado on the sly;
In fact, my form's the Blooming Utter!

"TOTTIE"
[1887]

[By "DAGONET" (G. R. SIMS) in _Referee_, 7 Nov.].

I

As she walked along the street
With her little 'plates of meat,' [1]
And the summer sunshine falling
On her golden 'Barnet Fair,' [2]
Bright as angels from the skies
Were her dark blue 'mutton pies.' [3]
In my 'East and West' Dan Cupid  [4]
Shot a shaft and left it there.

II

She'd a Grecian 'I suppose,'  [5]
And of 'Hampstead Heath' two rows,  [6]
In her 'Sunny South' that glistened [7]
Like two pretty strings of pearls;
Down upon my 'bread and cheese' [8]
Did I drop and murmur, 'Please
Be my "storm and strife," dear Tottie,  [9]
O, you darlingest of girls!'

III

Then a bow-wow by her side,  [10]
Who till then had stood and tried
A 'Jenny Lee' to banish, [11]
Which was on his 'Jonah's whale,' [12]
Gave a hydrophobia bark,
(She cried, 'What a Noah's Ark!') [13]
And right through my 'rank and riches' [14]
Did my 'cribbage pegs' assail. [15]

IV

Ere her bull-dog I could stop
She had called a 'ginger pop,' [16]
Who said, 'What the "Henry Meville" [17]
Do you think you're doing there?'
And I heard as off I slunk,
'Why, the fellow's "Jumbo's trunk!" [18]
And the 'Walter Joyce' was Tottie's [19]
With the golden 'Barnet Fair.'  [20]

A PLANK BED BALLAD
[1888]

[By "DAGONET" (G. R. SIMS) in _Referee_, 12 Feb.].


I

Understand, if you please, I'm a travelling thief,
The gonophs all call me the gypsy; [1]
By the rattler I ride when I've taken my brief, [2]
And I sling on my back an old kipsey. [3]

II

If I pipe a good chat, why, I touch for the wedge, [4]
But I'm not a "particular" robber;
I smug any snowy I see on the hedge, [5]
And I ain't above daisies and clobber. [6]

III

One day I'd a spree with two firms in my brigh, [7]
And a toy and a tackle--both red 'uns; [8]
And a spark prop a pal (a good screwsman) and I [9]
Had touched for in working two dead 'uns.

IV

I was taking a ducat to get back to town  [10]
(I had come by the rattler to Dover),
When I saw as a reeler was roasting me brown, [11]
And he rapped, "I shall just turn you over."  [12]

V

I guyed, but the reeler he gave me hot beef, [13]
And a scuff came about me and hollered;
I pulled out a chive, but I soon came to grief, [14]
And with screws and a james I was collared. [15]

VI

I was fullied, and then got three stretch for the job,[16]
And my trip--cuss the day as I seen her-- [17]
She sold off my home to some pals in her mob, [18]
For a couple of foont and ten deener. [19]

VII

Oh, donnys and omees, what gives me the spur, [20]
Is, I'm told by a mug (he tells whoppers), [21]
That I ought to have greased to have kept out of stir [22]
The dukes of the narks and the coppers. [23]

THE RONDEAU OF THE KNOCK
[1890]

[By "DAGONET" (G. R. SIMS) in _Referee_, 20 Ap. p. 7].


I

He took the knock! No more with jaunty air [1]
He'll have the "push" that made the punter stare;
  No more in monkeys now odds on he'll lay [2]
  And make the ever grumbling fielder gay.
One plunger more has had his little flare [3]
And then came to Monday when he couldn't "square"; [4]
  Stripped of his plunees a poor denuded J [5]
    He took the knock!
Where is he now? Ah! echo answers "where"?
  Upon the turf he had his little day
  And when, stone-broke, he could no longer pay [6]
Leaving the ring to gnash its teeth and swear
    He took the knock!

THE RHYME OF THE RUSHER
[1892]

[By DOSS CHIDERDOSS in _Sporting Times_, 29 Oct. _In
Appropriate Rhyming Slanguage_].


I

I was out one night on the strict teetote, [1]
  'Cause I couldn't afford a drain;
I was wearing a leaky I'm afloat, [2]
  And it started to France and Spain. [3]
But a toff was mixed in a bull and cow, [4]
  And I helped him to do a bunk; [5]
He had been on the I'm so tap, and now  [6]
  He was slightly elephant's trunk. [7]

II

He offered to stand me a booze, so I [8]
  Took him round to the "Mug's Retreat;"
And my round the houses I tried to dry [9]
  By the Anna Maria's heat.  [10]
He stuck to the I'm so to drown his cares,
  While I went for the far and near,  [11]
Until the clock on the apples and pears [12]
  Gave the office for us to clear. [13]

III

Then round at the club we'd another bout,
  And I fixed him at nap until
I had turned his skyrockets inside out, [14]
  And had managed my own to fill,
Of course, I had gone on the half-ounce trick,[15]
  And we quarrelled, and came to blows;
But I fired him out of the Roiy quick,
  And he fell on his I suppose. [16]

IV

And he laid there, weighing out prayers for me,
  Without hearing the plates of meat  [17]
Of a slop, who pinched him for "d. and d." [18]
  And disturbing a peaceful beat,
And I smiled as I closed my two mince pies [19]
  In my insect promenade;
For out of his nibs I had taken a rise, [20]
  And his stay on the spot was barred.

V

Next morning I brushed up my Barnet Fair, [21]
  And got myself up pretty smart;
Then I sallied forth with a careless air,
  And contented raspberry tart.  [22]
At the first big pub I resolved, if pos., [23]
  That I'd sample my lucky star;
So I passed a flimsy on to the boss [24]
  Who served drinks at the there you are. [25]

                    VI

He looked at the note, and the air began
  With his language to pen and ink; [26]
For the mug I'd fleeced had been his head man,  [27]
  And had done him for lots of chink. [28]
I'm blessed if my luck doesn't hum and ha,
  For I argued the point with skill;
But the once a week made me go ta-ta   [29]

WOT CHER!     [Notes]
_or, Knocked 'em in the Old Kent Rd._
[1892]

[By ALBERT CHEVALIER].


I

Last week down our alley come a toff, [1]
Nice old geezer with a nasty cough, [2]
Sees my Missus, takes 'is topper off  [3]
  In a very gentlemanly way!
"Ma'am," says he, "I 'ave some news to tell,
Your rich Uncle Tom of Camberwell,
Popped off recent, which it ain't a sell, [4]
  Leaving you 'is little Donkey Shay."
  "Wot cher!" all the neighbours cried,
    "Who're yer goin' to meet, Bill?
    Have yer bought the street, Bill?"
  Laugh! I thought I should 'ave died,
  Knock'd 'em in the Old Kent Road! [5]

II

Some says nasty things about the moke, [6]
One cove thinks 'is leg is really broke, [7]
That's 'is envy, cos we're carriage folk,
  Like the toffs as rides in Rotten Row!
Straight! it woke the alley up a bit, [8]
Thought our lodger would 'ave 'ad a fit,
When my missus, who's a real wit,
  Says, "I 'ates a Bus, because it's low!"
    "Wot cher!" &c.

III

When we starts the blessed donkey stops,
He won't move, so out I quickly 'ops,
Pals start whackin' him, when down he drops,
  Someone says he wasn't made to go.
Lor it might 'ave been a four-in-'and,
My Old Dutch knows 'ow to do the grand, [9]
First she bows, and then she waves 'er 'and,
  Calling out we're goin' for a blow!
    "Wot cher!" &c.

IV

Ev'ry evenin' on the stroke of five,
Me and Missus takes a little drive,
You'd say, "Wonderful they're still alive,"
  If you saw that little donkey go.
I soon showed him that 'e 'd have to do,
Just whatever he was wanted to,
Still I shan't forget that rowdy crew,
  'Ollerin' "Woa! steady! Neddy Woa!
    "Wot cher!" &c.

OUR LITTLE NIPPER      [Notes]
[1893]

[By ALBERT CHEVALIER].


I

I'm just about the proudest man that walks,
I've got a little nipper, when 'e talks  [1]
I'll lay yer forty shiners to a quid  [2]
You'll take 'im for the father, me the kid.
Now as I never yet was blessed wi' wealf,
I've 'ad to bring that youngster up myself,
And though 'is education 'as been free,
'E's allus 'ad the best of tips from me. [3]
    And 'e's a little champion,
    Do me proud well 'e's a knock out, [4]
  Takes after me and ain't a bit too tall.
    'E calls 'is mother "Sally,"
    And 'is father "good old pally,"
  And 'e only stands about so 'igh, that's all!

II

'E gits me on at skittles and 'e flukes,  [5]
And when 'e wants to 'e can use 'is "dooks," [6]
You see 'im put 'em up, well there, it's great,
'E takes a bit of lickin at 'is weight;
'E'll stick up like a Briton for 'is pals,
An' ain't 'e just a terror with the gals;
I loves to see 'im cuttin' of a dash,
A walkin' down our alley on the mash. [7]
  There, 'e's a little champion,
  Do me proud well 'e's a knock out,
  I've knowed 'im take a girl on six foot tall;
  'E'll git 'imself up dossy, [8]
  Say I'm goin' out wi' Flossie,
  An' 'e only stands about so 'igh, that's all.

III

I used to do a gin crawl e'vry night, [9]
An' very, very often come 'ome tight, [10]
But now of all sich 'abits I've got rid,
I al'us wants to git 'ome to the kid.
In teachin' 'im I takes a regular pride,
Not books, of course, for them 'e can't abide,
But artful little ikey little ways, [11]
As makes the people sit up where we stays. [12]

(_Spoken_)--Only last Sunday me an' the missus took 'im out for a
walk--I should say 'e took us out. As we was a comin' 'ome I says to
the old gal "Let's pop into the 'Broker's Arms' and 'ave a drop o'
beer?" She didn't raise no objection so in we goes, followed by 'is
nibs--I'd forgotten all about 'im--I goes to the bar and calls for two
pots of four 'alf; suddenly I feels 'im a tuggin' at my coat, "Wot's
up?" sez I; "Wot did yer call for?" sez 'e; "Two pots of four 'alf,"
sez I; "Oh," sez 'e, "ain't mother goin' to 'ave none?"

Well, 'e's a little champion,
Do me proud well 'e's a knock out,
"Drink up," sez 'e, "Three pots, miss, it's my call."
I sez "Now Jacky, Jacky;"
'E sez, "And a screw of baccy,"
And 'e only stands about so 'igh, that's all.

THE COSTER'S SERENADE
[1894]

[By ALBERT CHEVALIER].


I

You ain't forgotten yet that night in May,
Down at the Welsh 'Arp, which is 'Endon way,
You fancied winkles and a pot of tea,
"Four 'alf" I murmured's "good enough for me."
"Give me a word of 'ope that I may win"--
You prods me gently with the winkle pin--
We was as 'appy as could be that day
Down at the Welsh 'Arp, which is 'Endon way.

  Oh, 'Arriet I'm waiting, waiting for you my dear,
  Oh, 'Arriet I'm waiting, waiting alone out here;
    When that moon shall cease to shine,
    False will be this 'eart of mine,
  I'm bound to go on lovin' yer my dear; d'ye 'ear?

II

You ain't forgotten 'ow we drove that day
Down to the Welsh 'Arp, in my donkey shay;
Folks with a "chy-ike" shouted, "Ain't they smart?" [1]
You looked a queen, me every inch a Bart.
Seemed that the moke was saying "Do me proud;"
Mine is the nobbiest turn-out in the crowd; [2]
Me in my "pearlies" felt a toff that day, [3]
Down at the Welsh 'Arp, which is Endon way.
      Oh, 'Arriet, &c.

III

Eight months ago and things is still the same,
You're known about 'ere by your maiden name,
I'm getting chivied by my pals 'cos why? [4]
Nightly I warbles 'ere for your reply.
Summer 'as gone, and it's a freezin' now,
Still love's a burnin' in my 'eart, I vow;
Just as it did that 'appy night in May
Down at the Welsh 'Arp, which is Endon way.
    Oh, 'Arriet, &c.

[1: shout]
[2: finest; trap]

NOTES

_Rhymes Of The Canting Crew._
[Footnote: Throughout these notes free use has been made of the
_National Dictionary of Biography_; a work which, without
question, contains the latest and most accurately sifted array of
biographical information, much of which could not be obtained from any
other source whatever.]

These lines are of little interest apart from the fact of being the
earliest known example of the Canting speech or Pedlar's French in
English literature. Sorry in point or meaning, they are sorrier still
as verse. Yet, antedating, by half a century or more, the examples
cited by Awdeley and Harman, they possess a certain value they carry
us back almost to the beginnings of Cant, at all events to the time
when the secret language of rogues and vagabonds first began to assume
a concrete form.

Usually ascribed to Thomas Dekker (who "conveyed" them bodily, and
with errors, to _Lanthorne and Candlelight_, published in 1609)
this jingle of popular Canting phrases, strung together almost at
haphazard, is the production of Robert Copland (1508-1547), the author of
_The Hye Way to the Spyttel House_, a pamphlet printed after
1535, and of which only two or three copies are now known. Copland was
a printer-author; in the former capacity a pupil of Caxton in the
office of Wynkyn de Worde.

The plan of _The Hye Way_ is simplicity itself. Copland, taking
refuge near St. Bartholomew's Hospital during a passing shower,
engages the porter in conversation concerning the "losels, mighty
beggars and vagabonds, the michers, hedge-creepers, fylloks and
luskes" that "ask lodging for Our Lord's sake". Thereupon is drawn a
vivid and vigorous picture of the seamy side of the social life of the
times. All grades of "vagrom men," with their frauds and shifts, are
passed in review, and when Copland asks about their "bousy" speech,
the porter entertains him with these lines.

Lines 2 and 4. _Bousy_ = drunken, sottish, dissipated. So Skelton
in _Elynoor Rommin_ (Harl. MSS. ed. Park, I. 416), 'Her face all
_bowsie_'. _Booze_ = to drink heavily, is still colloquial;
and, = to drink, was in use as early as A.D. 1300. Line 4. _Cove_
(or _Cofe_) = a man, an individual. _Maimed nace_
(_nase_ or _nazy_) = helplessly drunk; Lat. _nausea_ =
sickness; _cf_. line 9, '_nace gere_'. Line 5. _Teare_
(_toure_ or _towre_) = to look, to see. _Patrying cove_
(_patrico, patricove_, or _pattercove_) = a strolling
priest; _cf_. Awdeley, _Frat. of Vacabondes_ (1560), p. 6.:--
"A Patriarke Co. doth make marriages, and that is untill death depart
the married folke, which is after this sort: When they come to a dead
Horse or any dead Catell, then they shake hands and so depart, euery
one of them a seuerall way." The form _patrying cove_ seems to
suggest a derivation from 'pattering' or 'muttering'--the Pater-
noster, up to the time of the Reformation, was recited by the priest
in a low voice as far as 'and lead us not into temptation' when the
choir joined in. _Darkman_


_cace_ (or _case_) = a sleeping apartment or place--ward,
barn, or inn: _darkmans_ = night + Lat. _casa_ = house etc.:
'_mans_' is a common canting affix = a thing or place: _e.g.
lightmans_ = day; _ruffmans_ = a wood or bush;
_greenmans_ = the fields; _Chepemans_ = Cheapside market
etc. Line 6. _docked the dell_ = deflowered the girl: _dell_
= virgin; _see_ Harman, _Caveat_ (1575), p. 75:--'A dell is
a yonge wenche, able for generation, and not yet knowen or broken by
the upright man'. _Coper meke_ (or _make_) = a half-penny.
Line 7. _His watch_ = he: _my watch_ = I, or me: _cf_.
'his nabs' and 'my nabs' in modern slang. _Feng_ (A. S.) = to
get, to steal, to snatch. _Prounces nobchete_ = prince's hat or
cap: _cheat_ (A. S.) = thing, and mainly used as an affix: thus,
_belly-chete_ = an apron; _cackling-chete_ = a fowl;
_crashing-chetes_ = the teeth; _nubbing-chete_ = the
gallows, and so forth. Line 8. _Cyarum, by Salmon_--the meaning
of _cyarum_ is unknown: _by Salmon_ (or _Solomon_) = a
beggar's oath, _i.e_.,  by the altar or mass. _Pek my jere_
= eat excrement: _cf_. 'turd in your mouth'. Line 9. _gan_ =
mouth. _My watch_, see _ante_, line 7. _Nace gere_ =
nauseous stuff: _cf. ante_, line 4: _gere_ = generic for
thing, stuff, or material. Line 10. _bene bouse_ = strong drink
or wine.


_The Beggar's Curse_

Thomas Dekker, one of the best known of the Elizabethan pamphleteers
and dramatists, was born in London about 1570, and began his literary
career in 1597-8 when an entry referring to a loan-advance occurs in
Henslowe's _Diary_. A month later forty shillings were advanced
from the same source to have him discharged from

the Counter, a debtor's prison. Dekker was a most voluminous writer,
and not always overparticular whence he got, or how he used, the
material for his tracts and plays. _The Belman of London Bringing to
Light the Most Notorious Villanies that are now practised in the
Kingdome_ (1608) of which three editions were published in one
year, consists mainly of pilferings from Harman's _Caveat for Common
Curselors_ first published in 1566-7. He did not escape conviction,
however, for Samuel Rowlands showed him up in _Martin Mark-All_.
Yet another instance of wholesale "conveyance" is mentioned in the
Note to "Canting Rhymes" (_ante_). In spite of this shortcoming,
however, and a certain recklessness of workmanship, the scholar of to-
day owes Dekker a world of thanks: his information concerning the
social life of his time is such as can be obtained nowhere else, and
it is, therefore, now of sterling value.

_Lanthorne and Candlelight_ is the second part of _The Belman
of London_. Published also in 1608, it ran to two editions in 1609,
a fourth appearing in 1612 under the title of _O per se O, or a new
Cryer of Lanthorne and Candlelight, Being an Addition or Lengthening
of the Belman's Second Night Walke_. Eight or nine editions of this
second part appeared between 1608 and 1648 all differing more or less
from each other, another variation occurring when in 1637 Dekker
republished _Lanthorne and Candlelight_ under the title of
_English Villanies_, shortly after which he is supposed to have
died.

_"Towre Out Ben Morts"_

Samuel Rowlands, a voluminous writer _circa_ 1570-1628, though
little known now, nevertheless kept the publishers busy for thirty
years, his works selling readily for another half century. Not the
least valuable of his numerous productions from a social and
antiquarian point of view is _Martin Mark-All, Beadle of Bridewell;
his Defence and Answere to the Belman of London_ (see both Notes
_ante_).

Martin Markall delivers himself of a vivid and "originall" account of
"the Regiment of Rogues, when they first began to take head, and how
they have succeeded one the other successively unto the sixth and
twentieth year of King Henry the Eighth, gathered out of the Chronicle
of Crackropes" etc. He then criticizes somewhat severely the errors
and omissions in Dekker's Canting glossary, adding considerably to it,
and finally joins issue with the Belman in an attempt to give "song
for song". Dekker's "Canting Rhymes" (plagiarised from Copland) and
"The Beggar's Curse" thus apparently gave birth to the present verses
and to those entitled "The Maunder's Wooing" that follow.

Stanza I, line i. _Ben_ = Lat. _bene_ = good. _Mort_ =
a woman, chaste or not. Line 3. _Rome-cove_ = "a great rogue" (B.
E., _Dict. Cant. Crew_, 1690), _i.e_.,  an organizer, or the
actual perpetrator of a robbery: _quire-cove_ = a subordinate
thief--the money had passed from the actual thief to his confederate.
_Rom_ (or _rum_) and _quier_ (or _queer_) enter
largely into combination, thus--_rom_ = gallant, fine, clever,
excellent, strong; _rom-bouse_ = wine or strong drink; _rum-
bite_ = a clever trick or fraud; _rum-blowen_ = a handsome
mistress; _rum-bung_ = a full purse; _rum-diver_ = a clever
pickpocket; _rum-padder_ = a well-mounted highwayman, etc.: also
_queere_ = base, roguish; _queer-bung_ = an empty purse;
_queer-cole_ = bad money; _queer-diver_ = a bungling
pickpocket; _queer-ken_ = a prison; _queer-mart_ = a
foundered whore, and so forth. _Budge_ = a general verb of
action, usually stealthy action: thus, _budge a beak_ = to give
the constable the slip, or to bilk a policeman; _to budge out_
(or _off_) = to sneak off; _to budge an alarm_ = to give
warning.

_The Maunder's Wooing_

_See_ previous Note.

Stanza II, line 2. _Autem mort_ = a wife; thus Harman,
_Caveat_ (1575):--"These Autem Mortes be maried wemen, as there
be but a fewe. For Autem in their Language is a Churche; so she is a
wyfe maried at the Church, and they be as chaste as a Cowe I have,
that goeth to Bull every moone, with what Bull she careth not." Line
5. _wap_ = to lie carnally with.

Stanza IV, line 5. _Whittington_ = Newgate, from the famous Lord
Mayor of London who left a bequest to rebuild the gaol. After standing
for 230 years Whittington's building was demolished in 1666.

Stanza V, line 2. _Crackmans_ = hedges or bushes. _Tip lowr
with thy prat_ = (literally) get money with thy buttocks,
_i.e._ by prostitution.

Stanza VI, line 2. _Clapperdogen_ = (B. E. _Dict. Cant.
Crew,_ 1690) "a beggar born and bred"; also Harman, _Caveat_,
etc. p. 44:--" these go with patched clokes, and have their morts with
them, which they call wives."

_"A Gage Of Ben Rom-Bouse"_

Thomas Middleton, another of the galaxy of Elizabethan writers
contributing so many sidelights on Shakspeare's life and times, is
supposed to have been of gentle birth. He entered Gray's Inn about
1593 and was associated with Dekker in the production of _The
Roaring Girl_, probably having the larger share in the composition.
Authorities concur in tracing Dekker's hand in the canting scenes, but
less certainly elsewhere. The original of Moll Cut-purse was a Mary
Frith (1584--1659), the daughter of a shoemaker in the Barbican.
Though carefully brought up she was particularly restive under
discipline, and finally became launched as a "bully, pickpurse,
fortune-teller, receiver and forger" in all of which capacities she
achieved considerable notoriety. As the heroine of _The Roaring
Girl_ Moll is presented in a much more favorable light than the
facts warrant.

Line 11. _And couch till a palliard docked my dell_ = (literally)
'And lie quiet while a beggar deflowered my girl', but here probably =
while a beggar fornicates with my mistress.

_"Bing Out, Bien Morts"_

[See Note to "The Beggar's Curse"]. Dekker introducing these verses
affirms "it is a canting song not ... composed as those of the
Belman's were, out of his owne braine, but by the Canter's themselves,
and sung at their meetings", in which, all things considered, Dekker
is probably protesting overmuch.

Stanza V, line 3. _And wapping dell that niggles well_ = a harlot
or mistress who "spreads" acceptably.

Stanza IX, line 2. _Bing out of the Rom-vile;_

i.e. to Tyburn, then the place of execution: _Rom-vile_ = London.

_The Song Of The Begger_

_The Description of Love_ is an exceedingly scarce little
"garland" which first appeared in 1620; but of that edition no copies
are known to exist. Of the sixth edition, from which this example is
taken, one copy is in the British Museum and another in the library
collected by Henry Huth Esq. A somewhat similar ballad occurs in the
Roxburgh Collection I, 42 (the chorus being almost identical), under
the title of "The Cunning Northern Beggar". The complete title is _A
Description of Love. With certain Epigrams, Elegies, and Sonnets. And
also Mast. Iohnson's Answere to Mast. Withers. With the Crie of
Ludgate, and the Song of the Begger. The sixth Edition. London,
Printed by M. F. for FRANCIS COULES at the Upper end of the Old-Baily
neere Newgate, 1629._

Stanza II, line I. _If a Bung be got by the Hie-law, i.e._ by
Highway robbery.

_The Maunder's Initation_

John Fletcher(1579--1625), dramatist, a younger son of Dr. Richard
Fletcher afterwards bishop of London, by his first wife Elizabeth, was
born in December 1579 at Rye in Sussex, where his father was then
officiating as minister. A 'John Fletcher of London' was admitted 15
Oct. 1591 a pensioner of Bene't (Corpus) College, Cambridge, of which
college Dr. Fletcher had been president. Dycc assumes that this John
Fletcher, who became one of the bible-clerks in 1593, was the
dramatist. Bishop Fletcher died, in needy circumstances, 15 June 1596,
and by his will, dated 26 Oct. 1593, left his books to be divided
between his sons Nathaniel and John.

_The Beggar's Bush_ was performed at Court at Christmas 1622, and
was popular long after the Restoration.

Fletcher was buried on 29 Aug. 1625 at St. Saviour's, Southwark. 'In
the great plague, 1625,' says Aubrey (_Letters written by Eminent
Persons,_ vol. ii. pt. i. p. 352), 'a knight of Norfolk or Suffolk
invited him into the countrey. He stayed but to make himselfe a suite
of cloathes, and while it was makeing fell sick of the plague and
died.'


_The High Pad's Boast_

See Note to "The Maunder's, Initiation", _ante_.

_The Merry Beggars_

Little is known of the birth or extraction of Richard Brome, and
whether he died in 1652 or 1653 is uncertain. For a time he acted as
servant to Ben Jonson. _The Jovial Crew_ was produced in 1641 at
The Cock-pit, a theatre which stood on the site of Pitt Place running
out of Drury Lane into Gt. Wild St.

Stanza I, line 5. _Go-well and Com-well_ = outgoing and incoming.

_A Mort's Drinking Song_

_See_ Note to "The Merry Beggars," _ante_.

"A Beggar I'll Be"

This ballad is from the Bagford Collection which, formed by John
Bagford (1651-1716), passed successively through the hands of James
West (president of the Royal Society), Major Pearson, the Duke of
Roxburghe and Mr. B. H. Bright, until in 1845 it and the more
extensive Roxburghe Collection became the property of the nation.

Stanza II, line 1. _Maunder_ = beggar. Line 2. _filer_ =
pickpocket; _filcher_ = thief. Line 3. _canter_ = a tramping
beggar or rogue. Line 4. _lifter_ = a shop-thief.

Stanza IV, line 8. _Compter_ (or _Counter_), _King's
Bench, nor the Fleet_, all prisons for debtors.

Stanza V, line 6, _jumble_ = to copulate.

Stanza VIII, line 5. _With Shinkin-ap-Morgan, with Blue-cap, or
Teague_ = With a Welshman, Scotchman, or Irishman--generic: as now
are Taffy, Sandy, and Pat.

_A Budg And Snudg Song_

Chappell in _Popular English Music of the Olden Time_ says that
this song appears in _The Canting Academy_ (2nd ed. 1674) but the
writer has been unable to find a copy of the book in question. The
song was very popular, and many versions (all varying) are extant. The
two given have been carefully collated. The portions in brackets [ ],-
-for example stanza II, line 6, stanza III, lines 1--7, stanza IV,
lines 5--8 etc.--only appear in the _New Canting Dict_. (1725).
It was sung to the tune now known as _There was a jolly miller once
lived on the river Dee_.

Title. _Budge_ = "one that slips into a house in the dark, and
taketh cloaks, coats, or what comes next to hand, marching off with
them" (B. E., _Dict. Cant. Crew_, 1690). _Snudge_ = "one
that lurks under a bed, to watch an opportunity to rob the house"--(B.
E., _Dict. Cant. Crew_, 1690).

Stanza I, line 7. _Whitt_= Newgate (see Note p. 204).

Stanza V, line 3. _Jack Ketch_, the public hangman 1663-1686.

_The Maunder's Praise Of His Strowling Mort_

_The Triumph of Wit_ by J. Shirley is a curious piece of
bookmaking--scissors and paste in the main--which ran through many
editions. Divided into three parts, the first two are chiefly
concerned with "the whole art and mystery of love in all its nicest
intrigues", "choice letters with their answers" and such like matters.
Part III contains "the mystery and art of Canting, with the original
and present management thereof, and the ends to which it serves, and
is employed: Illustrated with poems, songs and various intrigues in
the Canting language with the explanation, etc." The songs were
afterwards included in _The New Canting Dict._ (1725), and later
on in _Bacchus and Venus_ (1731).

Title. _Strowling Mort_ = a beggar's trull:--"pretending to be
widows, sometimes travel the countries ... are light-fingered, subtle,
hypocritical, cruel, and often dangerous to meet, especially when the
ruffler is with them" (B. E., _Dict. Cant. Crew_, 1690).

Stanza I, line 1. _Doxy_--"These Doxes be broken and spoyled of
their maydenhead by the upright men, and then they have their name of
Doxes, and not afore. And afterwards she is commen and indifferent for
any that wyll use her".--Harman, _Caveat_, p. 73. Line 3.
_prats_ = buttocks or thighs. Line 4. _wap_ = to copulate
(also stanza IV, line i).

Stanza II, line 4. _clip and kiss_ = to copulate.

_The Rum-Mort's Praise Of Her Faithless Maunder_

Obviously a companion song to the previous example: See Note
_ante_. _Rum-Mort_ = a beggar or gypsy queen.

Stanza I, line 1. _Kinching-cove_ = (literally) a child or young
lad: here as an endearment. Line 4. _Clapperdogeon_ = "The
Paillard or Clapperdogeons, are those that have been brought up to beg
from their infancy, and frequently counterfeit lameness, making their
legs, arms, and hands appear to be sore"--_Triumph of Wit_, p.
185.

Stanza II, line 1. _Dimber-damber_ = a chief man in the Canting
Crew, or the head of a gang. Line 2. _Palliard_ (See note Stanza
I). Line 3. _jockum_ =_penis_. Line 4. _glimmer_ =
fire; here, a pox or clap.

Stanza V, line 1. _crank_ (or _counterfeit-crank_)--"These
that do counterfet the cranke be yong knaves and yonge harlots that
deeply dissemble the falling sickness".--(Harman, _Caveat_, 1814,
p. 33). Line 1. _dommerar_= a beggar feigning deaf and dumb. Line
2. _rum-maunder_ = to feign madness. Line 3. _Abram-cove_ =
a beggar pretending madness to cover theft. Line 4. _Gybes well
jerk'd_ = pass or license cleverly forged.

_The Black Procession_

See Note as to J. Shirley on page 209.

_Frisky Moll's Song_

John Harper (d. 1742), actor, originally performed at Bartholomew and
Southwark fairs. On 27 Oct. 1721 his name appears as Sir Epicure
Mammon in the _Alchemist_ at Drury Lane. Here he remained for
eleven years, taking the parts of booby squires, fox-hunters, etc.,
proving himself what Victor calls 'a jolly facetious low comedian'.
His good voice was serviceable in ballad opera and farce. On account
of his 'natural timidity', according to Davies, he was selected by
Highmore, the patentee, in order to test the status of an actor, to be
the victim of legal proceedings taken under the Vagrant Act, 12 Queen
Anne, and on 12 Nov. 1733 he was committed to Bridewell as a vagabond.
On 20 Nov. he came before the chief justice of the Kings Bench. It was
pleaded on his behalf that he paid his debts, was well esteemed by
persons of condition, was a freeholder in Surrey, and a householder in
Westminster. He was discharged amid acclamations on his own
recognisance.

_The Canter's Serenade_

_The New Canting Dictionary_ (1725) is, in the main, a reprint of
_The Dictionary of the Canting_* _Crew_ (_c_. 1696)
compiled by B. E. The chief difference is that the former contains a
collection of Canting Songs, most of which are included in the present
collection.

Stanza I, line 3. _palliards--see_ Note, p. 210, ten lines from
bottom.


_"Retoure My Dear Dell"_

_See_ Note to "The Canter's Serenade." This song appears to be a
variation of a much older one, generally ascribed to Chas II, entitled
_I pass all my hours in a shady old grove_.


_The Vain Dreamer_

_See_ Note to "The Canter's Serenade."


_"When My Dimber Dell I Courted"_

_See_ Note to "The Canter's Serenade." The first two stanzas
appear in a somewhat different form as "a new song" to the time of
_Beauty's Ruin_ in _The Triumph of Wit_ (1707), of which the
first stanza is as follows:--

  When Dorinda first I courted,
    She had charms and beauty too;
  Conquering pleasures when she sported,
    The transport it was ever new:
  But wastful time do's now deceive her,
    Which her glories did uphold;
  All her arts can ne'er relieve her,
    Poor Dorinda is grown old.

Stanza I, line 4. _Wap_ = the act of kind. _Dimber dell_ =
pretty wench--"A dell is a yonge wenche, able for generation, and not
yet knowen or broken by the upright man ... when they have beene lyen
with all by the upright man then they be Doxes, and no Dells."--
(HARMAN).

Stanza III, line 3. _Upright-men_--"the second rank of the
Canting tribes, having sole right to the first night's lodging with
the Dells."--(B. E., _Dict. Cant. Crew_, 1696).


_The Oath Of The Canting Crew_

Bamfylde Moore Carew, the King of the Gypsies, born in 1693, was the
son of the Rector of Bickley, near Tiverton. It is related that to
avoid punishment for a boyish freak he, with some companions, ran away
and joined the gypsies. After a year and a half Carew returned for a
time, but soon rejoined his old friends. His career was a long series
of swindling and imposture, very ingeniously carried out, occasionally
deceiving people who should have known him well. His restless nature
then drove him to embark for Newfoundland, where he stopped but a
short time, and on his return he pretended to be the mate of a vessel,
and eloped with the daughter of a respectable apothecary of Newcastle
on Tyne, whom he afterwards married. He continued his course of
vagabond roguery for some time, and when Clause Patch, a king, or
chief of the gypsies, died, Carew was elected his successor. He was
convicted of being an idle vagrant, and sentenced to be transported to
Maryland. On his arrival he attempted to escape, was captured, and
made to wear a heavy iron collar, escaped again, and fell into the
hands of some friendly Indians, who relieved him of his collar. He
took an early opportunity of leaving his new friends, and got into
Pennsylvania. Here he pretended to be a Quaker, and as such made his
way to Philadelphia, thence to New York, and afterwards to New London,
where he embarked for England. He escaped impressment on board a man-
of-war by pricking his hands and face, and rubbing in bay salt and
gunpowder, so as to simulate smallpox. After his landing he continued
his impostures, found out his wife and daughter, and seems to have
wandered into Scotland about 1745, and is said to have accompanied the
Pretender to Carlisle and Derby. The record of his life from this time
is but a series of frauds and deceptions, and but little is absolutely
known of his career, except that a relative, Sir Thomas Carew of
Hackern, offered to provide for him if he would give up his wandering
life. This he refused to do, but it is believed that he eventually did
so after he had gained some prizes in the lottery. The date of his
death is uncertain. It is generally given, but on no authority, as
being in 1770 but 'I. P.', writing from Tiverton, in _Notes and
Queries_, 2nd series, vol. IV, p. 522, says that he died in 1758.
The story of his life in detail is found in the well-known, and
certainly much-printed, _Life and Adventures of Bamfylde Moore
Carew_, the earliest edition of which (1745) describes him on the
title-page as "the Noted Devonshire Stroller and Dogstealer". This
book professes to have been "noted by himself during his passage to
America", but though no doubt the facts were supplied by Carew
himself, the actual authorship is uncertain, though the balance of
probability lies with Robert Goadby, a printer and compiler of
Sherborne Dorsetshire, who printed an edition in 1749. A correspondent
of _Notes and Queries_, however, states that Mrs. Goadby wrote it
from Carew's dictation. [_N. and Q._ 2 S iii. 4; iv. 330, 440,
522],

Line 1. _Crank Cuffin_ = _Queer Cove_ = a rogue. Line 9.
_Stop-hole Abbey_, "the nick-name of the chief rendezvous of the
Canting Crew ".--(B. E., _Dict. Cant. Crew_, 1696). Line 17.
_Abram_ = formerly a mendicant lunatic of Bethlehem Hospital who
on certain days was allowed to go out begging: hence a beggar feigning
madness. _Ruffler crack_ = an expert rogue. Line 18.
_Hooker_ = "peryllous and most wicked Knaves... for, as they
walke a day times, from house to house, to demaund Charite... well
noting what they see... that will they be sure to have... for they
customably carry with them a staffe of V. of VI. foote long, in which
within one ynch of the tope thereof, ys a lytle hole bored through, in
which hole they putte an yron hoke, and with the same they wyll pluck
unto them quickly anything that they may reche therewith."--(Harman,
_Caveat_, 1869, p. 35, 36). Line 19. _Frater_ = "such as beg
with a sham-patent or brief for Spitals, Prisons, Fires, etc."--(B.
E.). Line 20. _Irish toyle_ = a beggar-thief, working under
pretence of peddling pins, lace, and such-like wares. Line 21.
_Dimber-damber_ = the chief of a gang: also an expert thief.
_Angler_ = hooker (see _ante_). Line 23. _swigman_ = a
beggar peddling haberdashery to cover theft and roguery.
_Clapperdogeon_ = a beggar born and bred, _see_ note p. 210,
tenth line from bottom. Line 24. _Curtal_--"a curtall is much
like to the upright man (that is, one in authority, who may "call to
account", "command a share", chastise those under him, and "force any
of their women to serve his turn"), but hys authority is not fully so
great. He useth commonly to go with a short cloke, like to grey
Friers, and his woman with him in like livery, which he calleth his
Altham if she be hys wyfe, and if she be his harlot, she is called hys
Doxy."--(HARMAN). Line 25. _Whip-jack_ = a rogue begging with a
counterfeit license. _Palliard_ = a beggar born and bred.
_Patrico_ = a hedge-priest. Line 26. _Jarkman_ = "he that
can write and reade, and sometime speake latin. He useth to make
counterfaite licenses which they call gybes, and sets to seales, in
their language called Jarkes. "--(HARMAN). Line 27. _Dommerar_ =
a rogue pretending deaf and dumb. _Romany_ = a gipsy. Line 28.
_The family_ = the fraternity of vagabonds.

_"Come All You Buffers Gay"_

In the Roxburghe Collection (ii. 504) is a ballad upon which the
present song is clearly based. It is called _The West Country Nymph,
or the little maid of Bristol_ to the time of _Young Jemmy_
(_i.e._ the Duke of Monmouth, Charles II's natural son). The
first stanza runs--

Come all you maidens fair,
  And listen to my ditty,
In Bristol city fair
  There liv'd a damsel pretty.

_The Potato Man_

Stanza II, line 2. _Cly_ = properly pocket, but here is obviously
meant the contents.

Stanza IV, line 1. _Blue bird's-eye_ = a blue and silk
handkerchief with white spots.

_A Slang Pastoral_

Of R. Tomlinson nothing is known. The Dr. Byrom whose poem is here
parodied is perhaps best remembered as the author of a once famous
system of shorthand. He was born in 1691, went to the Merchant
Taylor's School, and at the age of 16 was admitted a pensioner of
Trinity College Cambridge. It was here that he wrote _My time, O ye
muses_. He died in 1763, and his poems, no inconsiderable
collection, were published in 1773.

_"Ye Scamps, Ye Pads, Ye Divers"_

Stanza I, line 1. _The lay_ = a pursuit, a scheme: here =
thievery and roguery in general.

Stanza IV, line 4. _Like Blackamore Othello &c._--the reference
is to _Othello_, v. 2. "Yet she must die, else she'll betray more
men. Put out the light, and then--put out the light."

_The Sandman's Wedding_

Though George Parker's name is not formally attached to this "Cantata"
there would appear little doubt, from internal evidence, that it, with
the two songs immediately following, forms part of a characteristic
series from the pen of this roving soldier-actor. Parker was born in
1732 at Green Street, near Canterbury and was 'early admitted', he
says, 'to walk the quarterdeck as a midshipman on board the Falmouth
and the Guernsey'. A series of youthful indiscretions in London
obliged him to leave the navy, and in or about 1754 to enlist as a
common soldier in the 2Oth regiment of foot, the second battalion of
which became in 1758 the 67th regiment, under the command of Wolfe. In
his regiment he continued a private, corporal, and sergeant for seven
years, was present at the siege of Belleisle, and saw service in
Portugal, Gibraltar, and Minorca. At the end of the war he returned
home as a supernumerary excise-man. About 1761 his friends placed him
in the King's Head inn at Canterbury where he soon failed. Parker went
upon the stage in Ireland, and in company with Brownlow Ford, a
clergyman of convivial habits, strolled over the greater part of the
island. On his return to London he played several times at the
Haymarket, and was later introduced by Goldsmith to Colman. But on
account of his corpulence Colman declined his services. Parker then
joined the provincial strolling companies, and was engaged for one
season with Digges, then manager of the Edinburgh Theatre. At
Edinburgh he married an actress named Heydon, from whom, however, he
was soon obliged to part on account of her dissolute life. Returning
again to London, he set up as wandering lecturer on elocution, and in
this character travelled with varying success through England. In
November 1776 he set out on a visit to France, and lived at Paris for
upwards of six months on funds supplied by his father. His resources
being exhausted, he left Paris in the middle of July 1777 on foot. On
reaching England he made another lecturing tour, which proved
unsuccessful. His wit, humour, and knowledge of the world rendered him
at one time an indispensable appendage to convivial gatherings of a
kind; but in his later days he was so entirely neglected as to be
obliged to sell gingerbread-nuts at fairs and race-meetings for a
subsistance. He died in Coventry poorhouse in April 1800.

_The Happy Pair and The Bunter's Christening and The
Masqueraders_

See note (_ante_) to "The Sandman's Wedding". _Life's Painter
etc._ ran through several editions.

_The Flash Man of St. Giles_

Stanza II, line 7. _Drunk as David's sow_ = beastly drunk. Grose
(_Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue_) says: One David
Lloyd, a Welshman, who kept an ale-house at Hereford, had a sow with
six legs, which was an object of great curiosity. One day David's
wife, having indulged too freely, lay down in the sty to sleep, and a
company coming to see the sow, David led them to the sty, saying, as
usual, "There is a sow for you! Did you ever see the like?" One of the
visitors replied, "Well, it is the drunkenest sow I ever beheld."
Whence the woman was ever after called "Davy's sow."

_A Leary Mot_

Stanza III, line 1. _Cock and Hen Club_ = a free-and-easy for
both sexes.

Stanza IV, line 4. _Tom Cribb_--_see_ note p. 223.

_"The Night Before Larry was Stretched"_

Neither the authorship nor the date of these inimitable verses are
definitely known. According to the best authorities, Will Maher, a
shoemaker of Waterford, wrote the song. Dr. Robert Burrowes, Dean of
St. Finbar's Cork, to whom it has been so often attributed, certainly
did not. Often quoted in song book and elsewhere. Francis Sylvester
Mahony, better known as "Father Prout" contributed to _Froser's
Magazine_ the following translation into the French.

La mort de Socrate.

_Par l'Abbe de Prout, Cure du Mont-aux-Cressons, pres de Cork._

  A la veille d'etre pendu,
Notr' Laurent recut dans son gite,
  Honneur qui lui etait bien du,
De nombreux amis la visite;
  Car chacun scavait que Laurent
A son tour rendrait la pareille,
  Chapeau montre, et veste engageant,
Pour que l'ami put boire bouteille,
  Ni faire, a gosier sec, le saut.

  "Helas, notre garden!" lui dis-je,
"Combien je regrette ton sort!
  Te voila fleur, que sur sa tige
Moisonne la cruelle mort!"--
  "Au diable," dit-il, "le roi George!
Ca me fait la valeur d'un bouton;
  Devant le boucher qui m'egorge,
Je serai comme un doux mouton,
  Et saurai montrer du courage!"

  Des amis deja la cohorte
Remplissait son etroit reduit:
  Six chandelles, ho! qu'on apporte,
Donnons du lustre a cette nuit!
  Alors je cherchai a connaitre
S'il s'etait dument repenti?
  "Bah! c'est les fourberies des pretres
Les gredins, ils en ont menti,
  Et leurs contes d'enfer sont faux!"

  L'on demande les cartes. Au jeu
Laurent voit un larron qui triche;
  D'honneur tout rempli, il prend feu,
Et du bon coup de poign l'affiche.
  "Ha, coquin! de mon dernier jour
Tu croyais profiler, peut-etre;
  Tu oses me jouer ce tour!
Prends ca pour ta peine, vil traitre!
  Et apprends a te bien conduire!"

  Quand nous eumes cesse nos ebats,
Laurent, en ce triste repaire
  Pour le disposer au trepas,
Voit entrer Monsieur le Vicaire.
  Apres un sinistre regard,
Le front de sa main il se frotte,
  Disant tout haut, "Venez plus tard!"
Et tout has, "Vilaine calotte!"
  Puis son verre il vida deux fois.

  Lors il parla de l'echaufaud,
Et de sa derniere cravate;
  Grands dieux! que ca paraissait beau
De la voir mourir en Socrate!
  Le trajet en chantant il fit--
La chanson point ne fut un pseaume;
  Mais palit un peu quand il vit
La statute de Roy Guillaume--
  Les pendards n'aiment pas ce roi!

  Quand fut au bout de son voyage,
Le gibet fut pret en un clin:
  Mourant il tourna de visage
Vers la bonne ville de Dublin.
  Il dansa la carmagnole,
Et mount comme fit Malbrouck;
  Puis nous enterrames le drole
Au cimetiere de Donnybrook
  Que son ame y soit en repos!

Stanza V, line 3. _Kilmainham_, a gaol near Dublin.

Stanza VI, line 7. _King William_, the statute of William III
erected on College Green in commemoration of the Battle of the Boyne.
It was long the object of much contumely on the part of the
Nationalists. It was blown to pieces in 1836, but was subsequently
restored.

_The Song of the Young Prig_

Said to have been written by Little Arthur Chambers, the Prince of
Prigs, who was one of the most expert thieves of his time. He began to
steal when he was in petticoats, and died a short time before Jack
Sheppard came into notice. Internal evidence, however, renders this
attributed authorship very improbable.

Stanza I, line 1. _Dyots Isle, i.e.,_ Dyot St., St. Giles,
afterwards called George St. Bloomsbury, was a well-known rookery
where thieves and their associates congregated.

Stanza II, line 3. _And I my reading learnt betime From studying
pocket-books._ "Pocket-book" = reader.

Stanza IV, line 1. _To work capital_ = to commit a crime
punishable with death. Previous to 1829 many offences, now thought
comparatively trivial, were deemed to merit the extreme penalty of the
law.

_The Milling Match_

_Tom Cribb's Memorial to Congress_: With a Preface, Notes, and
Appendix. By One of the Fancy. London, Longmans & Co., 1819. There
were several editions. Usually, with good reason, ascribed to Thomas
Moore. It may be remarked that, though the Irish Anacreon's claim to
fame rests avowedly on his more serious contributions to literature,
he was, nevertheless, never so popular as when dealing with what, in
the early part of the present century, was known as THE FANCY.
Pugilism then took the place, in the popular mind, that football and
cricket now occupy. Tom Cribb was born at Hanham in the parish of
Bitton, Gloucestershire, in 1781, and coming to London at the age of
thirteen followed the trade of a bell-hanger, then became a porter at
the public wharves, and was afterwards a sailor. From the fact of his
having worked as a coal porter he became known as the 'Black Diamond,'
and under this appellation he fought his first public battle against
George Maddox at Wood Green on 7 Jan. 1805, when after seventy-six
rounds he was proclaimed the victor, and received much praise for his
coolness and temper under very unfair treatment. In 1807 he was
introduced to Captain Barclay, who, quickly perceiving his natural
good qualities, took him in hand, and trained him under his own eye.
He won the championship from Bob Gregson in 1808 but in 1809 he was
beaten by Jem Belcher. He subsequently regained the belt. After an
unsuccessful venture as a coal merchant at Hungerford Wharf, London,
he underwent the usual metamorphosis from a pugilist to a publican,
and took the Golden Lion in Southwark; but finding this position too
far eastward for his aristocratic patrons he removed to the King's
Arms at the corner of Duke Street and King Street, St. James's, and
subsequently, in 1828, to the Union Arms, 26 Panton Street, Haymarket.
On 24 Jan. 1821 it was decided that Cribb, having held the
championship for nearly ten years without receiving a challenge, ought
not to be expected to fight any more, and was to be permitted to hold
the title of champion for the remainder of his life. On the day of the
coronation of George IV, Cribb, dressed as a page, was among the
prizefighters engaged to guard the entrance to Westminster Hall. His
declining years were disturbed by domestic troubles and severe
pecuniary losses, and in 1839 he was obliged to give up the Union Arms
to his creditors. He died in the house of his son, a baker in the High
Street, Woolwich, on 11 May 1848, aged 67, and was buried in Woolwich
churchyard, where, in 1851, a monument representing a lion grieving
over the ashes of a hero was erected to his memory. As a professor of
his art he was matchless, and in his observance of fair play he was
never excelled; he bore a character of unimpeachable integrity and
unquestionable humanity.

_Ya Hip, My Hearties!_

Stanza III, line 8. _Houyhnhnms_. A race of horses endowed with
human reason, and bearing rule over the race of man--a reference to
Dean Swift's _Gulliver's Travels_ (1726).

_Sonnets For The Fancy_

Pierce Egan, the author of the adventures of Tom and Jerry was born
about 1772 and died in 1849. He had won his spurs as a sporting
reporter by 1812, and for eleven years was recognised as one of the
smartest of the epigrammatists, song-writers, and wits of the time.
_Boxiana_, a monthly serial, was commenced in 1818. It consisted
of 'Sketches of Modern Pugilism', giving memoirs and portraits of all
the most celebrated pugilists, contemporary and antecedent, with full
reports of their respective prize-fights, victories, and defeats, told
with so much spirited humour, yet with such close attention to
accuracy, that the work holds a unique position. It was continued in
several volumes, with copperplates, to 1824. At this date, having seen
that Londoners read with avidity his accounts of country sports and
pastimes, he conceived the idea of a similar description of the
amusements pursued by sporting men in town. Accordingly he announced
the publication of _Life in London_ in shilling numbers, monthly,
and secured the aid of George Cruikshank, and his brother, Isaac
Robert Cruikshank, to draw and engrave the illustrations in aquatint,
to be coloured by hand. George IV had caused Egan to be presented at
court, and at once accepted the dedication of the forthcoming work.
This was the more generous on the king's part because he must have
known himself to have been often satirised and caricatured mercilessly
in the _Green Bag_ literature by G. Cruikshank, the intended
illustrator. On 15 July 1821 appeared the first number of _Life in
London_; or, 'The Day and Night Scenes of Jerry Hawthorn, Esq., and
his elegant friend, Corinthian Jem, accompanied by Bob Logic, the
Oxonian, in their Rambles and Sprees through the Metropolis.' The
success was instantaneous and unprecedented. It took both town and
country by storm. So great was the demand for copies, increasing with
the publication of each successive number, month by month, that the
colourists could not keep pace with the printers. The alternate scenes
of high life and low life, the contrasted characters, and revelations
of misery side by side with prodigal waste and folly, attracted
attention, while the vivacity of dialogue and description never
flagged.

Stanza III, line 10. _New Drop_. The extreme penalty of the law,
long carried out at Tyburn (near the Marble Arch corner of Hyde Park),
was ultimately transferred to Newgate. The lament for "Tyburn's merry
roam" was, without doubt, heart-felt and characteristic. Executions
were then one of the best of all good excuses for a picnic and
jollification. Yet the change of scene to Newgate does not appear to
have detracted much from these functions as shows. "Newgate to-day,"
says a recent writer in _The Daily Mail_, is little wanted, and
all but vacant, as a general rule. In former days enormous crowds were
herded together indiscriminately--young and old, innocent and guilty,
men, women, and children, the heinous offender, and the neophyte in
crime. The worst part of the prison was the "Press Yard," the place
then allotted to convicts cast for death. There were as many as sixty
or seventy sometimes within these narrow limits, and most were kept
six months and more thus hovering between a wretched existence and a
shameful death. Men in momentary expectation of being hanged rubbed
shoulders with others still hoping for reprieve. If the first were
seriously inclined, they were quite debarred from private religious
meditation, but consorted, perforce, with reckless ruffians, who
played leap-frog, and swore and drank continually. Infants of tender
years were among the condemned; lunatics, too, raged furiously through
the Press Yard, and were a constant annoyance and danger to all. The
"condemned sermon" in the prison chapel drew a crowd of fashionable
folk, to stare at those who were to die, packed together in a long pew
hung with black, and on a table in front was placed an open coffin.
Outside, in the Old Bailey, on the days of execution, the awful scenes
nearly baffle description. Thousands collected to gloat over the dying
struggles of the criminals, and fought and roared and trampled each
other to death in their horrible eagerness, so that hundreds were
wounded or killed. Ten or a dozen were sometimes hanged in a row, men
and women side by side.


_The True Bottomed Boxer_

complete collection of ancient and modern songs in the English
language, with a classified Index... Embellished with a Frontispiece
and wood cuts, designed by George Cruikshank etc. 3vols. London, 1825-

Stanza I, line 1. _Moulsey-Hurst rig_ = a prize-fight: Moulsey-
Hurst, near Hampton Court, was long a favorite _venue_ for
pugilistic encounters. Line 3. _Fibbing a nob is most excellent
gig_ = getting in a quick succession of blows on the head is good
fun. Line 4. _Kneading the dough_ = a good pummelling. Line 6.
_Belly-go-firsters_ = an initial blow, generally given in the
stomach. Line 8. _Measuring mugs for a chancery job_ = getting
the head under the arm or 'in chancery'.

Stanza II, line 1. _Flooring_ = downing (a man). _Flushing_
= delivering a blow right on the mark, and straight from the shoulder.
Line 5. _Crossing_ = unfair fighting; shirking.

Stanza III, line 5. _Victualling-office_ = the stomach. Line 6.
_Smeller and ogles_ = nose and eyes. Line 7. _Bread-basket_
= stomach. Line 8. _In twig_ = in form; ready.

_Bobby And His Mary_

[See _ante_ for note on _Universal Songster_].

Stanza I, line 1. _Dyot Street_, see note page 222.

Stanza II, line 16. _St. Pulchre's bell_, the great bell of St.
Sepulchre's Holborn, close to Newgate, always begins to toll a little
before the hour of execution, under the bequest of Richard Dove, who
directed that an exhortation should be made to "... prisoners that are
within, Who for wickedness and sin are appointed to die, Give ear unto
this passing bell."

_Poor Luddy_

Thomas John Dibdin (1771-1841), the author of this song, was an actor
and dramatist--an illegitimate son of Charles Dibdin the elder. He
claimed to have written nearly 2000 songs.

_The Pickpocket's Chaunt_

Eugene Francois Vidocq was a native of Arras, where his father was a
baker. From early associations he fell into courses of excess which
led to his flying from the paternal roof. After various, rapid, and
unexampled events in the romance of real life, in which he was
everything by turns and nothing long, he was liberated from prison,
and became the principal and most active agent of police. He was made
chief of the Police de Surete under Messrs. Delavau and Franchet, and
continued in that capacity from the year 1810 till 1827, during which
period he extirpated the most formidable gangs of ruffians to whom the
excesses of the revolution and subsequent events had given full scope
for daring robberies and iniquitous excesses. He settled down as a
paper manufacturer at St. Mande near Paris.

Of Maginn (1793-1842) it may be said he was, without question, one of
the most versatile writers of his time. He is, perhaps, best
remembered in connection with the _Noctes Ambrosianae_, which
first appeared in _Blackwood_, and with the idea of which Maginn
is generally credited. He was also largely concerned with the
inception of _Fraser's_. Maginn's English rendering of Vidocq's
famous song first appeared in _Blackwood_ for July 1829. For the
benefit of the curious the original is appended. It will be seen that
Maginn was very faithful to his copy.

_On the Prigging Lay_

H. T. R., the English translator of Vidocq's _Memoirs_ (4 vol.,
1828-9), says of this and the following renderings from the French
that they "with all their faults and all their errors, are to be added
to the list of the translator's sins, who would apologise to the Muse
did he but know which of the nine presides over Slang poetry." The
original of "On the Prigging Lay" is as follows:--

  Travaillant d'ordinaire,
La sorgue dans Pantin, [1]
Dans mainte et mainte affaire
Faisant tres-bon choppin, [2]
Ma gente cambriole, [3]
Rendoublee de camelotte, [4]
De la dalle au flaquet; [5]

Sans regout ni morace, [6]
Sans taff et sans regret. [7]

_"Nix My Doll, Pals, Fake Away"_

Ainsworth in his preface to _Rookwood_ makes the following
remarks on this and the three following songs:--"As I have casually
alluded to the flash song of Jerry Juniper, I may be allowed to make a
few observations upon this branch of versification. It is somewhat
curious with a dialect so racy, idiomatic, and plastic as our own
cant, that its metrical capabilities should have been so little
essayed. The French have numerous _chansons d'argot_, ranging
from the time of Charles Bourdigne and Villon down to that of Vidocq
and Victor Hugo, the last of whom has enlivened the horrors of his
'_Dernier Jour d'un Condamne_" by a festive song of this class.
The Spaniards possess a large collection of _Romances de
Germania_, by various authors, amongst whom Quevedo holds a
distinguished place. We on the contrary, have scarcely any slang songs
of merit. This barreness is not attributable to the poverty of the
soil, but to the want of due cultivation. Materials are at hand in
abundance, but there have been few operators. Dekker, Beaumont and
Fletcher, and Ben Jonson, have all dealt largely in this jargon, but
not lyrically; and one of the earliest and best specimens of a
canting-song occurs in Brome's '_Jovial Crew;_' and in the
'_Adventures of Bamfylde Moore Carew_' there is a solitary ode
addressed by the mendicant fraternity to their newly-elected monarch;
but it has little humour, and can scarcely be called a genuine
canting-song. This ode brings us down to our own time; to the
effusions of the illustrious Pierce Egan; to Tom Moore's Flights of
'_Fancy;_' to John Jackson's famous chant, '_On the High Toby
Spice flash the Muzzle,_' cited by Lord Byron in a note to '_Don
Juan;_' and to the glorious Irish ballad, worth them all put
together, entitled '_The Night before Larry was stretched_.' This
is attributed to the late Dean Burrowes, of Cork. [_See_ Note, p.
220 _Ed_.]. It is worthy of note, that almost all modern
aspirants to the graces of the _Musa Pedestris_ are Irishmen. Of
all rhymesters of the '_Road_,' however, Dean Burrowes is, as
yet, most fully entitled to the laurel. Larry is quite 'the potato!'

"I venture to affirm that I have done something more than has been
accomplished by my predecessors, or contemporaries, with the
significant language under consideration. I have written _a purely
flash song_; of which the great and peculiar merit consists in its
being utterly incomprehensible to the uninformed understanding, while
its meaning must be perfectly clear and perspicuous to the practised
_patterer_ of _Romany_, or _Pedler's French_. I have,
moreover, been the first to introduce and naturalize amongst us a
measure which, though common enough in the Argotic minstrelsy of
France, has been hitherto utterly unknown to our _pedestrian_
poetry." How mistaken Ainsworth was in his claim, thus ambiguously
preferred, the present volume shows. Some years after the song alluded
to, better known under the title of '_Nix my dolly, pals,--fake
away!'_ sprang into extra-ordinary popularity, being set to music
by Rodwell, and chanted by glorious Paul Bedford and clever little
Mrs. Keeley.

_The Game Of High Toby_

and

_The Double Cross_

_See_ note to "Nix my Doll, Pals, etc.," _ante_.

_The House Breaker's Song_

G. W. M. Reynolds followed closely on the heels of Dickens when the
latter scored his great success in _The Pickwick Papers_. He was
a most voluminous scribbler, but none of his productions are of high
literary merit.

_The Faking Boy To The Crap Is Gone_

_The Nutty Blowen_

_The Faker's New Toast_

and

_My Mother_

"Bon Gualtier" was the joint _nom-de-plume_ of W. E. Aytoun and
Sir Theodore Martin. Between 1840 and 1844 they worked together in the
production of _The Bon Gualtier Ballads_, which acquired such
great popularity that thirteen large editions of them were called for
between 1855 and 1877. They were also associated at this time in
writing many prose magazine articles of a humorous character, as well
as a series of translations of Goethe's ballads and minor poems,
which, after appearing in _Blackwood's Magazine_, were some years
afterwards (1858) collected and published in a volume. The four pieces
above mentioned appeared as stated in _Tails Edinburgh Magazine_
under the title of "Flowers of Hemp, or the Newgate Garland," and are
parodies of well-known songs.

_The High Pad's Frolic_

and

_The Dashy, Splashy.... Little Stringer_

Leman Rede (1802-47) an author of numerous successful dramatic pieces,
and a contributor to the weekly and monthly journals of the day,
chiefly to the _New Monthly_ and _Bentley's_. He was born in
Hamburgh, his father a barrister.


Some of the best parts ever played by Liston, John Reeve, Charles
Mathews, Keeley, and G. Wild were written by him.

_The Bould Yeoman_

_The Bridle-Cull and his little Pop-Gun_

_Jack Flashman_

_Miss Dolly Trull_

and

_The By-Blow Of The Jug_

_See_ Note to "Sonnets for The Fancy" p. 225. Captain Macheath
was one of Egan's latest, and by no means one of his best,
productions. It is now very scarce.

_The Cadger's Ball_

John Labern, a once popular, but now forgotten music-hall artiste, and
song-writer, issued several collections of the songs of the day. It is
from one of these that "The Cadger's Ball" is taken.

_"Dear Bill, This Stone-Jug"_

The state of affairs described in this poem is now happily a thing of
the past. Newgate, as a prison, has almost ceased to be. Only when the
Courts are sitting do its functions commence, and then there is
constant coming and going between the old city gaol and the real
London prison of to-day, Holloway Castle.

_The Leary Man_

_The Vulgar Tongue_, by Ducarge Anglicus, is, as a glossary, of
no account whatever; the only thing not pilfered from Brandon's
_Poverty, Mendicity, and Crime_ being this song. Where that came
from deponent knoweth not.

_A Hundred Stretches Hence_

_The Rogue's Lexicon_, mainly reprinted from Grose's
_Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue_, is of permanent interest and
value to the philologist and student for the many curious survivals
of, and strange shades of meaning occurring in, slang words and
colloquilisms after transplantation to the States. G. W. Matsell was
for a time the chief of the New York police.

_The Chickaleary Cove_

Vance, a music-hall singer and composer in the sixties, made his first
great hit in _Jolly Dogs; or Slap-bang! here we are again_. This
was followed by _The Chickaleary Cove_: a classic in its way.

_'Arry at a Political Picnic_

The 'Arry Ballads' are too fresh in public memory to need extensive
quotation. The example given is a fair sample of the series; which,
taken as a whole, very cleverly "hit off" the idiosyncrasies and
foibles of the London larrikin.

Stanza VIII, line 4. _Walker_ = Be off!

_"Rum Coves that Relieve us"_

Heinrich Baumann, the author of _Londonism en_, an English-German
glossary of cant and slang, to which "Rum Coves that Relieve us" forms
the preface.

_Villon's Good Night_

_Villon's Straight Tip_

and

_Culture in the Slums_

William Ernest Henley, poet, critic, dramatist, and editor was born at
Gloucester in 1849, and educated at the same city. In his early years
(says _Men of the Time_) he suffered much from ill-health, and
the first section of his _Book of Verses_ (1888: 4th ed. 1893),
_In Hospital: Rhymes and Rhythms_, was a record of experiences in
the Old Infirmary, Edinburgh, in 1873-5. In 1875 he began writing for
the London magazines, and in 1877 was one of the founders as well as
the editor of _London_. In this journal much of his early verse
appeared. He was afterwards appointed editor of _The Magazine of
Art_, and in 1889 of _The Scots_, afterwards _The National
Observer_. To these journals, as well as to _The Athenaeum_
and _Saturday Review_ he has contributed many critical articles,
a selection of which was published in 1890 under the title of _Views
and Reviews_. In collaboration with Robert Louis Stevenson he has
published a volume of plays, one of which, _Beau Austin_, was
produced at the Haymarket Theatre in 1892. His second volume of
verses--_The Song of the Sword_--marks a new departure in style.
He has edited a fine collection of verses, _Lyra Heroica_, and,
with Mr. Charles Whibley, an anthology of English prose. In 1893 Mr.
Henley received the honour of an L.L.D. degree of St. Andrew's
university. At the present time he is also editing _The New
Review_, a series of _Tudor Translations_, a new _Byron_,
a new _Burns_, and collaborating with Mr. J. S. Farmer in
_Slang and its Analogues_; an historical dictionary of slang.

"_Villon's Straight Tip_: Stanza I, line I. _Screeve_ =
provide (or work with) begging-letters. Line 2. _Fake the broads_
= pack the cards. _Fig a nag_ = play the coper with an old horse

_"Tottie"_

_A Plank-Bed Ballad_

and

_The Rondeau of the Knock_

G. R. Sims ("Dagonet") needs little introduction to present-day
readers. Born in London in 1847, he was educated at Harwell College,
and afterwards at Bonn. He joined the staff of _Fun_ on the death
of Tom Hood the younger in 1874, and _The Weekly Despatch_ the
same year. Since 1877 he has been a contributor to _The Referee_
under the pseudonym of "Dagonet". A voluminous miscellaneous writer,
dramatist, poet, and novelist, M. Sims shows yet no diminution of his
versatility and power.

_Wot Cher!_

_Our Little Nipper_

and

_The Coster's Serenade_

Albert Chevalier, a "coster poet", music-hall artist, and musician of
French extraction was born in Hammersmith. He is a careful, competent
actor of minor parts, and sings his own little ditties extremely well.


APPENDIX

THERE are still one or two "waifs and strays" to be mentioned:--

I.

In _Don Juan_, canto XI, stanzas xvii--xix, Byron thus describes
one of his _dramatis personae_.

Poor Tom was once a kiddy upon town,
  A thorough varmint and a real swell...
Full flash, all fancy, until fairly diddled,
His pockets first, and then his body riddled.

       *        *        *        *        *

He from the world had cut off a great man
  Who in his time had made heroic bustle.
  Who in a row like Tom could lead the van,
Booze in the ken, or in the spellken hustle?
  Who queer a flat? Who (spite of Bow Street's ban)
  On the high-toby-splice so flash the muzzle?
Who on a lark, with Black-eyed Sal (his blowing)
So prime, so swell, so nutty, and so knowing?

In a note Byron says, "The advance of science and of language has
rendered it unnecessary to translate the above good and true English,
spoken in its original purity by the select mobility and their
patrons. The following is the stanza of a song which was very popular,
at least in my early days:--"

("If there be any German so ignorant as to require a traduction, I
refer him to my old friend and corporeal pastor and master John
Jackson, Esq., Professor of Pugilism.")

On the high toby splice flash the muzzle
  In spite of each gallows old scout;
If you at the spellken can't hustle
  You'll be hobbled in making a clout.
Then your blowing will wax gallows haughty,
  When she hears of your scaly mistake
She'll surely turn snitch for the forty--
  That her Jack may be regular weight.

John Jackson, to whom is attributed the slang song of which the
foregoing stanza is a fragment was the son of a London builder. He was
born in London on 28 Sept. 1769, and though he fought but thrice, was
champion of England from 1795 to 1803, when he retired, and was
succeeded by Belcher. After leaving the prize-ring, Jackson
established a school at No. 13 Bond Street, where he gave instructions
in the art of self-defence, and was largely patronised by the nobility
of the day. At the coronation of George IV he was employed, with
eighteen other prize-fighters dressed as pages, to guard the entrance
to Westminster Abbey and Hall. He seems, according to the inscription
on a mezzotint engraving by C. Turner, to have subsequently been
landlord of the Sun and Punchbowl, Holborn, and of the Cock at Button.
He died on 7 Oct. 1845 at No. 4 Lower Grosvenor Street West, London,
in his seventy-seventh year, and was buried in Brompton Cemetery,
where a colossal monument was erected by subscription to his memory.
Byron, who was one of his pupils, had a great regard for him, and
often walked and drove with him in public. It is related that, while
the poet was at Cambridge, his tutor remonstrated with him on being
seen in company so much beneath his rank, and that he replied that
"Jackson's manners were infinitely superior to those of the fellows of
the college whom I meet at 'the high table'" (J. W. Clark, Cambridge,
1890, p. 140). He twice alludes to his 'old friend and corporeal
pastor and master' in his notes to his poems (Byron, _Poetical
Works_, 1885-6, ii. 144, vi. 427), as well as in his 'Hints from
Horace' (ib. i. 503):

And men unpractised in exchanging knocks
Must go to Jackson ere they dare to box.

Moore, who accompanied Jackson to a prize-fight in December 1818,
notes in his diary that Jackson's house was 'a very neat establishment
for a boxer', and that the respect paid to him everywhere was 'highly
comical' (_Memoirs_, ii. 233). A portrait of Jackson, from an
original painting then in the possession of Sir Henry Smythe, bart.,
will be found in the first volume of Miles's 'Pugilistica' (opp. p.
89). There are two mezzotint engravings by C. Turner.

II.

IN Boucicault's _Janet Pride_ (revival by Charles Warner at the
Adelphi Theatre, London in the early eighties) was sung the following
(here given from memory):

The Convict's Song.

THE FAREWELL.
Farewell to old England the beautiful!
  Farewell to my old pals as well!
Farewell to the famous Old Ba-i-ly
    (_Whistle_).
  Where I used for to cut sich a swell,
    Ri-chooral, ri-chooral, Oh!!!

THE [WERDHICK?]
These seving long years I've been serving,
  And seving I've got for to stay,
All for bashin' a bloke down our a-alley,
    (_Whistle_).
  And a' takin' his huxters away!

THE COMPLAINT.
There's the Captain, wot is our Commanduer,
  There's the Bosun and all the ship's crew,
There's the married as well as the single 'uns,
    (_Whistle_).
  Knows wot we pore convicks goes through.

THE [SUFFERING?]
It ain't' cos they don't give us grub enough,
  It ain't' cos they don't give us clo'es:
It's a-cos all we light-fingred gentery
    (_Whistle_).
  Goes about with a log on our toes.

THE PRAYER.
Oh, had I the wings of a turtle-dove,
  Across the broad ocean I'd fly,
Right into the arms of my Policy love
    (_Whistle_).
  And on her soft bosum I'd lie!

THE MORRELL.
Now, all you young wi-counts and duchesses,
  Take warning by wot I've to say,
And mind all your own wot you touches is,
    (_Whistle_).
  Or you'll jine us in Botinny Bay!
    Oh!!!
    Ri-chooral, ri-chooral, ri-addiday,
      Ri-chooral, ri-chooral, iday.

MR. DOOLEY'S PHILOSOPHY

by

FINLEY PETER DUNNE







_Illustrated by_

F. OPPER.



[Illustration: POOR PEOPLE 'LL HAVE SIMPLE MEALS.]



_To the Hennessys of the world who suffer and are silent_




PREFACE


The reporter of these monologues would apologize for the frequent
reappearances of Mr. Dooley, if he felt the old gentleman would
appreciate an apology in his behalf. But Mr. Dooley has none of the
modesty that has been described as "an invention for protection against
envy," because unlike that one of his distinguished predecessors who
discovered this theory to excuse his own imperfect but boastful egotism,
he recognizes no such human failing as envy. Most of the papers in the
present collection of the sayings of this great and learned man have
appeared in the press of America and England. This will account for the
fact that they deal with subjects that have pressed hard upon the minds
of newspaper readers, statesmen, and tax-payers during the year. To
these utterances have been added a number of obiter dicta by the
philosopher, which, perhaps, will be found to have the reminiscent
flavor that appertains to the observations of all learned judges when
they are off the bench.

In some cases the sketches have been remodeled and care has been taken
to correct typographical blunders, except where they seemed to improve
the text. In this connection the writer must offer his profound
gratitude to the industrious typographer, who often makes two jokes grow
where only one grew before, and has added generously to the distress of
amateur elocutionists.

A BOOK REVIEW


"Well sir," said Mr. Dooley, "I jus' got hold iv a book, Hinnissy, that
suits me up to th' handle, a gran' book, th' grandest iver seen. Ye know
I'm not much throubled be lithrachoor, havin' manny worries iv me own,
but I'm not prejudiced again' books. I am not. Whin a rale good book
comes along I'm as quick as anny wan to say it isn't so bad, an' this
here book is fine. I tell ye 'tis fine."

"What is it?" Mr. Hennessy asked languidly.

"'Tis 'Th' Biography iv a Hero be Wan who Knows.' 'Tis 'Th' Darin'
Exploits iv a Brave Man be an Actual Eye Witness.' 'Tis 'Th' Account iv
th' Desthruction iv Spanish Power in th' Ant Hills,' as it fell fr'm th'
lips iv Tiddy Rosenfelt an' was took down be his own hands. Ye see 'twas
this way, Hinnissy, as I r-read th' book. Whin Tiddy was blowed up in
th' harbor iv Havana he instantly con-cluded they must be war. He
debated th' question long an' earnestly an' fin'lly passed a jint
resolution declarin' war. So far so good. But there was no wan to carry
it on. What shud he do? I will lave th' janial author tell th' story in
his own wurruds.

"'Th' sicrety iv war had offered me,' he says, 'th' command of a
rig'mint,' he says, 'but I cud not consint to remain in Tampa while
perhaps less audacious heroes was at th' front,' he says. 'Besides,' he
says, 'I felt I was incompetent f'r to command a rig'mint raised be
another,' he says. 'I detarmined to raise wan iv me own,' he says. 'I
selected fr'm me acquaintances in th' West,' he says, 'men that had
thravelled with me acrost th' desert an' th' storm-wreathed mountain,'
he says, 'sharin' me burdens an' at times confrontin' perils almost as
gr-reat as anny that beset me path,' he says. 'Together we had faced th'
turrors iv th' large but vilent West,' he says, 'an' these brave men had
seen me with me trusty rifle shootin' down th' buffalo, th' elk, th'
moose, th' grizzly bear, th' mountain goat,' he says, 'th' silver man,
an' other ferocious beasts iv thim parts,' he says. 'An' they niver
flinched,' he says. 'In a few days I had thim perfectly tamed,' he says,
'an' ready to go annywhere I led,' he says. 'On th' thransport goi'n to
Cubia,' he says, 'I wud stand beside wan iv these r-rough men threatin'
him as a akel, which he was in ivrything but birth, education, rank an'
courage, an' together we wud look up at th' admirable stars iv that
tolerable southern sky an' quote th' bible fr'm Walt Whitman,' he says.
'Honest, loyal, thrue-hearted la-ads, how kind I was to thim,' he says."

[Illustration: Read the articles by Roosevelt and Davis in the Car Fare
Magazine]

"'We had no sooner landed in Cubia than it become nicessry f'r me to
take command iv th' ar-rmy which I did at wanst. A number of days was
spint be me in reconnoitring, attinded on'y be me brave an' fluent body
guard, Richard Harding Davis. I discovered that th' inimy was heavily
inthrenched on th' top iv San Juon hill immejiately in front iv me. At
this time it become apparent that I was handicapped be th' prisence iv
th' ar-rmy,' he says. 'Wan day whin I was about to charge a block house
sturdily definded be an ar-rmy corps undher Gin'ral Tamale, th' brave
Castile that I aftherwards killed with a small ink-eraser that I always
carry, I r-ran into th' entire military force iv th' United States lying

says. 'Who ar-re ye?' says they. 'Colonel Rosenfelt,' says I. 'Oh,
excuse me,' says the gin'ral in command (if me mimry serves me thrue it
was Miles) r-risin' to his knees an' salutin'. This showed me 'twud be
impossible f'r to carry th' war to a successful con-clusion unless I was
free, so I sint th' ar-rmy home an' attackted San Juon hill. Ar-rmed
on'y with a small thirty-two which I used in th' West to shoot th' fleet
prairie dog, I climbed that precipitous ascent in th' face iv th' most
gallin' fire I iver knew or heerd iv. But I had a few r-rounds iv gall
mesilf an' what cared I? I dashed madly on cheerin' as I wint. Th'
Spanish throops was dhrawn up in a long line in th' formation known
among military men as a long line. I fired at th' man nearest to me an'
I knew be th' expression iv his face that th' trusty bullet wint home.
It passed through his frame, he fell, an' wan little home in far-off
Catalonia was made happy be th' thought that their riprisintative had
been kilt be th' future governor iv New York. Th' bullet sped on its mad
flight an' passed through th' intire line fin'lly imbeddin' itself in
th' abdomen iv th' Ar-rch-bishop iv Santiago eight miles away. This
ended th' war.'

"'They has been some discussion as to who was th' first man to r-reach
th' summit iv San Juon hill. I will not attempt to dispute th' merits iv
th' manny gallant sojers, statesmen, corryspondints an' kinetoscope men
who claim th' distinction. They ar-re all brave men an' if they wish to
wear my laurels they may. I have so manny annyhow that it keeps me broke
havin' thim blocked an' irned. But I will say f'r th' binifit iv
Posterity that I was th' on'y man I see. An I had a tillyscope.'"

"I have thried, Hinnissy," Mr. Dooley continued, "to give you a fair
idee iv th' contints iv this remarkable book, but what I've tol' ye is
on'y what Hogan calls an outline iv th' principal pints. Ye'll have to
r-read th' book ye'ersilf to get a thrue conciption. I haven't time f'r
to tell ye th' wurruk Tiddy did in ar-rmin' an' equippin' himself, how
he fed himsilf, how he steadied himsilf in battle an' encouraged himsilf
with a few well-chosen wurruds whin th' sky was darkest. Ye'll have to
take a squint into th' book ye'ersilf to l'arn thim things."

"I won't do it," said Mr. Hennessy. "I think Tiddy Rosenfelt is all r-
right an' if he wants to blow his hor-rn lave him do it."

"Thrue f'r ye," said Mr. Dooley, "an' if his valliant deeds didn't get
into this book 'twud be a long time befure they appeared in Shafter's
histhry iv th' war. No man that bears a gredge again' himsilf 'll iver
be governor iv a state. An' if Tiddy done it all he ought to say so an'
relieve th' suspinse. But if I was him I'd call th' book 'Alone in
Cubia.'"




AMERICANS ABROAD


"I wondher," said Mr. Dooley, "what me Dutch frind Oom Paul'll think
whin he hears that Willum Waldorf Asthor has given four thousan' pounds
or twinty thousan' iv our money as a conthribution to th' British
governmint?"

"Who's Willum Waldorf Asthor?" Mr. Hennessy asked. "I niver heerd iv
him."

"Ye wudden't," said Mr. Dooley. "He don't thravel in ye'er set. Willum
Waldorf Asthor is a gintleman that wanst committed th' sin iv bein'
bor-rn in this counthry. Ye know what orig-inal sin is, Hinnissy. Ye was
bor-rn with wan an' I was bor-rn with wan an' ivrybody was bor-rn with
wan. 'Twas took out iv me be Father Tuomy with holy wather first an' be
me father aftherward with a sthrap. But I niver cud find out what it
was. Th' sins I've committed since, I'm sure iv. They're painted red an'
carry a bell an' whin I'm awake in bed they stan' out on th' wall like
th' ilicthric signs they have down be State sthreet in front iv th'
clothin' stores. But I'll go to th' grave without knowin' exactly what
th' black orig-inal sin was I committed. All I know is I done wrong. But
with Willum Waldorf Asthor 'tis dif'rent. I say 'tis diff'rent with
Willum Waldorf Asthor. His orig-inal sin was bein' bor-rn in New York.
He cudden't do anything about it. Nawthin' in this counthry wud wipe it
out. He built a hotel intinded f'r jooks who had no sins but thim iv
their own makin', but even th' sight iv their haughty bills cud not
efface th' stain. He thried to live down his crime without success an'
he thried to live down to it be runnin' f'r congress, but it was no go.
No matther where he wint among his counthrymen in England some wan wud
find out he was bor-rn in New York an' th' man that ownded th' house
where he was spindin' th' night wud ast him if he was a cannibal an' had
he anny Indyan blood in his veins. 'Twas like seein' a fine lookin' man
with an intel-lecjal forehead an' handsome, dar-rk brown eyes an'
admirin' him, an' thin larnin' his name is Mudd J. Higgins. His accint
was proper an' his clothes didn't fit him right, but he was not bor-rn
in th' home iv his dayscindants, an' whin he walked th' sthreets iv
London he knew ivry polisman was sayin': 'There goes a man that pretinds
to be happy, but a dark sorrow is gnawin' at his bosom. He looks as if
he was at home, but he was bor-rn in New York, Gawd help him.'

"So this poor way-worn sowl, afther thryin' ivry other rimidy fr'm
dhrivin' a coach to failin' to vote, at las' sought out th' rile high
clark iv th' coort an' says he: 'Behold,' he says, 'an onhappy man,' he
says. 'With millyons in me pocket, two hotels an' onlimited credit, 'he
says, 'me hear-rt is gray,' he says. 'Poor sowl,' says th' clark iv th'
coort, 'What's ailin' ye'?' he says. 'Have ye committed some gr-reat
crime?' he says. 'Partly,' says Willum Waldorf Asthor. 'It was partly me
an' partly me folks,' he says. 'I was,' he says, in a voice broken be
tears, 'I was,' he says, 'bor-rn in New York,' he says. Th' clark made
th' sign iv th' cross an' says he: 'Ye shudden't have come here,' he
says. 'Poor afflicted wretch,' he says, 'ye need a clargyman,' he says.
'Why did ye seek me out?' he says. 'Because,' says Willum Waldorf
Asthor, 'I wish,' he says, 'f'r to renounce me sinful life,' he says. 'I
wish to be bor-rn anew,' he says. An' th' clark bein' a kind man helps
him out. An' Willum Waldorf Asthor renounced fealty to all foreign
sovereigns, princes an' potentates an' especially Mack th' Wanst, or
Twict, iv th' United States an' Sulu an' all his wur-ruks an' he come
out iv th' coort with his hat cocked over his eye, with a step jaunty
and high, afther years iv servile freedom a bondman at last!

"So he's a citizen iv Gr-reat Britain now an' a lile subject iv th'
Queen like you was Hinnissy befure ye was r-run out."

"I niver was," said Mr. Hennessy. "Sure th' Queen iv England was
renounced f'r me long befure I did it f'r mesilf--to vote."

"Well, niver mind," Mr. Dooley continued, "he's a citizen iv England an'
he has a castle that's as big as a hotel, on'y nobody goes there excipt
thim that's ast, an' not all of those, an' he owns a newspaper an' th'
editor iv it's the Prince iv Wales an' th' rayporthers is all jooks an'
th' Archbishop iv Canterbury r-runs th' ilivator, an' slug wan in th'
printin' office is th' Impror iv Germany in disgeese. 'Tis a pa-per I'd
like to see. I'd like to know how th' Jook iv Marlbro'd do th' McGovern
fight. An' some day Willum Waldorf Asthor'll be able to wurruk f'r his
own pa-aper, f'r he's goin' to be a earl or a markess or a jook or
somethin' gran'. Ye can't be anny iv these things without money,
Hinnissy, an' he has slathers iv it."

"Where does he get it?" demanded Mr. Hennessy.

"F'rm this counthry," said Mr. Dooley.

"I shud think," Mr. Hennessy protested stoutly, "if he's ashamed iv this
counthry he wudden't want to take money f'rm it."

"That's where ye're wrong," Mr. Dooley replied. "Take money annywhere ye
find it. I'd take money f'rm England, much as I despise that formerly
haughty but now dejected land, if I cud get anny from there. An' whin ye
come down to it, I dinnaw as I blame Willum Waldorf Asthor f'r shiftin'
his allegiance. Ivry wan to his taste as th' man said whin he dhrank out
iv th' fire extinguisher. It depinds on how ye feel. If ye ar-re a tired
la-ad an' wan without much fight in ye, livin' in this counthry is like
thryin' to read th' Lives iv the Saints at a meetin' iv th' Clan-na-
Gael. They'se no quiet f'r annybody. They's a fight on ivry minyit iv
th' time. Ye may say to ye'ersilf: 'I'll lave these la-ads roll each
other as much as they plaze, but I'll set here in th' shade an' dhrink
me milk punch, but ye can't do it. Some wan 'll say, 'Look at that
gazabo settin' out there alone. He's too proud f'r to jine in our simple
dimmycratic festivities. Lave us go over an' bate him on th' eye.' An'
they do it. Now if ye have fightin' blood in ye'er veins ye hastily gulp
down yeer dhrink an' hand ye'er assailant wan that does him no kind iv
good, an' th' first thing ye know ye're in th thick iv it an' its scrap,
scrap, scrap till th' undhertaker calls f'r to measure ye. An' 'tis tin
to wan they'se somethin' doin' at th' fun'ral that ye're sorry ye
missed. That's life in America. Tis a gloryous big fight, a rough an'
tumble fight, a Donnybrook fair three thousan' miles wide an' a ruction
in ivry block. Head an' ban's an' feet an' th' pitchers on th' wall. No
holds barred. Fight fair but don't f'rget th' other la-ad may not know
where th' belt line is. No polisman in sight. A man's down with twinty
on top iv him wan minyit. Th' next he's settin' on th' pile usin' a
base-ball bat on th' neighbor next below him. 'Come on, boys, f'r 'tis
growin' late, an' no wan's been kilt yet. Glory be, but this is th'
life!'

"Now, if I'm tired I don't want to fight. A man bats me in th' eye an' I
call f'r th' polis. They isn't a polisman in sight. I say to th' man
that poked me: 'Sir, I fain wud sleep.' 'Get up,' he says, 'an' be
doin',' he says. 'Life is rale, life is earnest,' he says, 'an' man was
made to fight,' he says, fetchin' me a kick. An' if I'm tired I say,
'What's th' use? I've got plenty iv money in me inside pocket. I'll go
to a place where they don't know how to fight. I'll go where I can get
something but an argymint f'r me money an' where I won't have to rassle
with th' man that bates me carpets, ayether,' I says, 'f'r fifty cints
overcharge or good govermint,' I says. An' I pike off to what Hogan
calls th' effete monarchies iv Europe an' no wan walks on me toes, an'
ivry man I give a dollar to becomes an acrobat an' I live comfortably
an' die a markess! Th' divvle I do!

"That's what I was goin' to say," Mr. Hennessy remarked. 'Ye wudden't
live annywhere but here."

"No," said Mr. Dooley, "I wudden't. I'd rather be Dooley iv Chicago than
th' Earl iv Peltvule. It must be that I'm iv th' fightin' kind."




SERVANT GIRL PROBLEM


Whin Congress gets through expellin' mimbers that believes so much in
mathrimony that they carry it into ivry relation iv life an' opens th'
dure iv Chiny so that an American can go in there as free as a Chinnyman
can come into this refuge iv th' opprissed iv th' wurruld, I hope'twill
turn its attintion to th' gr-reat question now confrontin' th' nation--
th' question iv what we shall do with our hired help. What shall we do
with thim?

"We haven't anny," said Mr. Hennessy.

"No," said Mr. Dooley. "Ar-rchey r-road has no servant girl problem. Th'
rule is ivry woman her own cook an' ivry man his own futman, an' be th'
same token we have no poly-gamy problem an' no open dure problem an' no
Ph'lippeen problem. Th' on'y problem in Ar-rchey r-road is how manny
times does round steak go into twelve at wan dollar-an-a-half a day.
But east iv th' r-red bridge, Hinnissy, wan iv th' most cryin' issues iv
th' hour is: What shall we do with our hired help? An' if Congress don't
take hold iv it we ar-re a rooned people."

"'Tis an ol' problem an' I've seen it arise an' shake its gory head ivry
few years whiniver th' Swede popylation got wurruk an' begun bein'
marrid, thus rayjoocin' th' visible supply iv help. But it seems 'tis
deeper thin that. I see be letters in th' pa-apers that servants is
insolent, an' that they won't go to wurruk onless they like th' looks iv
their employers, an' that they rayfuse to live in th' counthry. Why anny
servant shud rayfuse to live in th' counthry is more thin I can see.
Ye'd think that this disreputable class'd give annything to lave th'
crowded tinimints iv a large city where they have frinds be th'
hundherds an' know th' polisman on th' bate an' can go out to hateful
dances an' moonlight picnics--ye'd think these unforchnate slaves'd be
delighted to live in Mulligan's subdivision, amid th' threes an' flowers
an' bur-rds. Gettin' up at four o'clock in th' mornin' th' singin' iv
th' full-throated alarm clock is answered be an invisible choir iv
songsters, as Shakespere says, an' ye see th' sun rise over th' hills as
ye go out to carry in a ton iv coal. All day long ye meet no wan as ye
thrip over th' coal-scuttle, happy in ye'er tile an' ye'er heart is
enlivened be th' thought that th' childher in th' front iv th' house ar-
re growin' sthrong on th' fr-resh counthry air. Besides they'se always
cookin' to do. At night ye can set be th' fire an' improve ye'er mind be
r-readin' half th' love story in th' part iv th' pa-aper that th' cheese
come home in, an' whin ye're through with that, all ye have to do is to
climb a ladder to th' roof an' fall through th' skylight an' ye're in
bed."

[Illustration]


"But wud ye believe it, Hinnissy, manny iv these misguided women
rayfuse f'r to take a job that aint in a city. They prefer th' bustle
an' roar iv th' busy marts iv thrade, th' sthreet car, th' saloon on
three corners an' th' church on wan, th' pa-apers ivry mornin' with
pitchers iv th' s'ciety fav'rite that's just thrown up a good job at
Armours to elope with th' well-known club man who used to be yard-
masther iv th' three B's, G, L, & N., th' shy peek into th' dhry-goods
store, an' other base luxuries, to a free an' healthy life in th'
counthry between iliven P.M. an' four A.M. Wensdahs an' Sundahs. 'Tis
worse thin that, Hinnissy, f'r whin they ar-re in th' city they seem to
dislike their wurruk an' manny iv thim ar-re givin' up splindid jobs
with good large families where they have no chanst to spind their
salaries, if they dhraw thim, an' takin' places in shops, an' gettin'
marrid an' adoptin' other devices that will give thim th' chanst f'r to
wear out their good clothes. 'Tis a horrible situation. Riley th'
conthractor dhropped in here th' other day in his horse an' buggy on his
way to the dhrainage canal an' he was all wurruked up over th' question.
'Why,' he says, ''tis scand'lous th' way servants act,' he says. 'Mrs.
Riley has hystrics,' he says. 'An' ivry two or three nights whin I come
home,' he says, 'I have to win a fight again' a cook with a stove lid
befure I can move me family off th' fr-ront stoop,' he says. 'We threat
thim well too,' he says. 'I gave th' las' wan we had fifty cints an' a
cook book at Chris'mas an' th' next day she left befure breakfast,' he
says. 'What naytionalties do ye hire?' says I. 'I've thried thim all,'
he says, 'an',' he says, 'I'll say this in shame,' he says, 'that th'
Irish ar-re th' worst,' he says. 'Well,' says I, 'ye need have no
shame,' I says, 'f'r'tis on'y th' people that ar-re good servants
that'll niver be masthers,' I says. 'Th' Irish ar-re no good as servants
because they ar-re too good,' I says. 'Th' Dutch ar-re no good because
they aint good enough. No matther how they start they get th' noodle
habit. I had wan, wanst, an' she got so she put noodles in me tay,' I
says. 'Th' Swedes ar-re all right but they always get marrid th' sicond
day. Ye'll have a polisman at th' dure with a warrant f'r th' arrist iv
ye'er cook if ye hire a Boheemyan,' I says. 'Coons'd be all right but
they're liable f'r to hand ye ye'er food in ragtime, an' if ye ordher
pork-chops f'r dinner an' th' hall is long,'tis little ye'll have to eat
whin th' platter's set down,' I says. 'No,' says I, 'they'se no
naytionality now livin' in this counthry that're nathral bor-rn
servants,' I says. 'If ye want to save throuble,' I says, 'ye'll import
ye'er help. They'se a race iv people livin' in Cinthral Africa that'd be
jus' r-right. They niver sleep, tkey can carry twice their weight on
their backs, they have no frinds, they wear no clothes, they can't read,
they can't dance an' they don't dhrink. Th' fact is they're thoroughly
oneddycated. If ye cud tache thim to cook an' take care iv childher
they'd be th' best servants,' says I. 'An' what d'ye call thim"?' says
he. 'I f'rget,' says I. An' he wint away mad."

"Sure an' he's a nice man to be talkin' iv servants," said Mr. Hennessy.
"He was a gintleman's man in th' ol' counthry an' I used to know his
wife whin she wurruked f'r ----"

"S-sh," said Mr. Dooley. "They're beyond that now. Besides they speak
fr'm experyence. An' mebbe that's th' throuble. We're always harder with
our own kind thin with others. 'Tis I that'd be th' fine cinsor iv a
bartinder's wurruk. Th' more ye ought to be a servant ye'ersilf th' more
difficult'tis f'r ye to get along with servants. I can holler to anny
man fr'm th' top iv a buildin' an' make him tur-rn r-round, but if I
come down to th' sthreet where he can see I aint anny bigger thin he is,
an' holler at him, 'tis twinty to wan if he tur-rns r-round he'll hit me
in th' eye. We have a servant girl problem because, Hinnissy, it isn't
manny years since we first begun to have servant girls. But I hope
Congress'll take it up. A smart Congress like th' wan we have now ought
to be able to spare a little time fr'm its preparation iv new Jims iv
speech f'r th' third reader an' rig up a bill that'd make keepin' house
a recreation while so softenin' th' spirit iv th' haughty sign iv a
noble race in th' kitchen that cookin' buckwheat cakes on a hot day with
th' aid iv a bottle iv smokeless powdher'd not cause her f'r to sind a
worthy man to his office in slippers an' without a hat."

"Ah," said Mr. Hennessy, the simple democrat. "It wud be all r-right if
women'd do their own cookin'."

"Well," said Mr. Dooley. "'Twud be a return to Jacksonyan simplicity,
an' 'twud be a gr-reat thing f'r th' resthrant business."




THE TRANSVAAL


"It looks like war," said Mr. Hennessy, who had been glancing at the
flaming head-lines of an evening paper over Mr. Dooley's shoulder.

"It always does," said Mr. Dooley. "Since th' Czar iv Rooshia
inthrajooced his no-fight risolution, they'se been no chanst that they
wudden't be ructious."

"An' what's it all about?" demanded Mr. Hennessy. "I can't make head nor
tail iv it at all, at all."

"Well ye see 'tis this way," said Mr. Dooley. "Ye see th' Boers is a
simple, pasthral people that goes about their business in their own way,
raisin' hell with ivrybody. They was bor-rn with an aversion to society
an' whin th' English come they lit out befure thim, not likin' their
looks. Th' English kept comin' an' the Boers kept movin' till they
cudden't move anny further without bumpin' into th' Soodanese ar-rmy an'
thin they settled down an' says they, 'This far shall we go,' says they,
bein' a rellijous people, 'an' divvle th' sthep further.' An' they
killed off th' irrelijous naygurs an' started in f'r to raise cattle.
An' at night they'd set outside iv their dorps, which, Hinnissy, is
Dutch f'r two-story brick house an' lot, an' sip their la-ager an' swap
horses an' match texts fr'm th' Bible f'r th' seegars, while th' childer
played marbles with dimons as big as th' end iv ye'er thumb.

"Well, th' English heerd they was goold be th' bucket in ivry cellar
fr'm Oopencoff to Doozledorf, which, Hinnissy, is like New York an' San
Francisco, bein' th' exthreme pints iv th' counthry, an' they come on in
gr-reat hordes, sturdy Anglo-Saxons fr'm Saxony, th' Einsteins an'
Heidlebacks an' Werners an' whin they took out goold enough so's they
needed raycreation they wanted to vote. 'An',' says Joe Chamberlain, he
says, 'Be hivins, they shall vote,' he says. 'Is it,' he says, 'possible
that at this stage iv th' world's progress' he says, 'an English
gintleman shud be denied,' he says, 'th' right to dhrop off a thrain
annywhere in th' civilized wurruld an' cast his impeeryal vote?' he
says. 'Give thim th' franchise,' he says, 'or be this an' be that!' he
says, 'f'r we have put our hand to th' plough, an' we will not turn
back,' he says.

[Illustration]

"Kruger, that's th' main guy iv th' Dutch, a fine man, Hennissy, that
looks like Casey's goat an' has manny iv th' same peculyarities, he
says, 'All r-right,' he says, 'I'll give thim th' franchise,' he says.
'Whin?' says Joe Chamberlain. 'In me will,' says Kruger. 'Whin I die,'
he says, 'an' I hope to live to be a hundherd if I keep on smokin'
befure breakfast,' he says, 'I'll bequeath to me frinds, th' English, or
such iv thim as was here befure I come, th' inalienable an' sacred right
to demand fr'm me succissor th' privilege iv ilictin' an aldherman,' he
says. 'But,' he says, 'in th' mane-time,' he says, 'we'll lave things
the way they are,' he says. 'I'm old,' he say, 'an' not good-lookin','
he says, 'an' me clothes don't fit an' they may be marks iv food on me
vest,' he says, 'but I'm not more thin half crazy an' annytime ye find
me givin' annywan a chanst to vote me into a job dhrivin' a mule an' put
in an English prisidint iv this ray-public,' he says, 'ye may conclude
that ye'er Uncle Paul needs a guarjeen!' he says.

"'Far be it fr'm me to suggist anny but peaceful measures,' says Sir
Alfred Milner, that's th' lad they have down in Africa, th' Injun agent,
'f'r th' English an' Dutch shud wurruk together like brothers f'r th'
removal iv th' naygur popylation,' he says, 'but,' he says, 'as a
brother I politely suggest to ye that if ye don't give us what we want
we'll hand ye a fraternal punch!' he says. 'F'r,' he says,' 'we have put
our hand to th' plough,' he says, 'an' we cannot turn back,' he says.

"'What Sir Alfred Milner says is thrue,' says Lord Lelborne, an' what
th' divvle he has to do about it I dinnaw. 'Th' situation is such,' he
says, 'as to be intol'rable to a silf-rayspictin' Englishman,' he says.
'What a crime,' he says, 'that th' men who ar-re takin' most iv th'
money out iv th' counthry shud not be allowed to stick in anny iv th'
votes,' he says. 'We have, as Shakespeare says, put our hand to th'
plough,' he says, 'an' we cannot turn back,' he says. 'I agree corjally
with th' noble lord on th' r-red lounge abaft me,' says Lord Salisbury.
'With the echoes of me own noble sintimints on th' peace proclamation iv
me good frind, th' Czar iv Rooshia, still ringin' in me ears,' he says,
'it wud ill become me to speak iv foorce,' he says. 'I wud on'y say that
if th' Transvaal raypublic wud rather have a Dum-dum bullet in its tum-
tum thin grant to Englishmen th' r-right to run th' govermint, thin th'
Transvaal rapublic'll have both!' he says. 'I will add,' he says, 'that
we have put our hand to th' plough an' we will not turn back,' he says.

"Well, sir, 'twas up to Kruger an' he knocked th' ashes out iv his pipe
on his vest an' says he, 'Gintlemen,' he says, 'I wud like to do me best
to accomydate ye,' he says. 'Nawthin' short iv a severe attack iv
sickness wud plaze me so much as to see long lines iv Englishmen
marchin' up to th' polls an' depositin' their ballots again' me f'r
prisidint,' he says. 'But,' he says, 'I'm an old man!' he says. 'I was
ilicted young an' I niver done annything since,' he says. 'I wudden't
know what to do without it,' he says. 'What ye propose is to make an ex-
prisidint iv me. D'ye think I cud stand that? D'ye think at my age I wud
be contint to dash fr'm wan justice coort to another pleadin' f'r
habyas-corpus writs or test me principles iv personal expansion in a Noo
Jarsey village?' he says. 'I'd rather be a dead prisidint thin a live
ex-prisidint. If I have anny pollytical ambition I'd rather be a Grant
or a Garfield thin a Cleveland or a Harrison,' he says. 'I may've read
it in th' Bible, though I think I saw it in a scand'lous book me frind
Rhodes left in his bedroom las' time he called on me, that ye shud niver
discard an ace to dhraw to a flush,' he says. 'I deplore th' language
but th' sintimint is sound,' he says. 'An' I believe ye'er intintions to
presarve peace ar-re honest, but I don't like to see ye pullin' off
ye'er coat an' here goes f'r throuble while ye have ye'er arms in th'
sleeves,' he says. 'F'r,' he says, 'ye have put ye'er hand in th' reaper
an' it cannot turn back,' he says.

"An' there they go, Hinnissy. I'm not again England in this thing,
Hinnissy, an' I'm not again th' Boers. Like Mack I'm divided on a
matther iv principle between a desire to cemint th' 'lieance an' an
affiction f'r th' Dutch vote. But if Kruger had spint his life in a rale
raypublic where they burn gas he cud've settled th' business without
losin' sleep. If I was Kruger there'd've been no war."

"What wud ye have done?" Mr. Hennessy asked.

"I'd give thim th' votes," said Mr. Dooley. "But," he added
significantly, "I'd do th' countin'."




WAR AND WAR MAKERS


"I tell ye, Hinnissy," said Mr. Dooley, "Ye can't do th' English-
speakin' people. Oursilves an' th' hands acrost th' sea ar-re rapidly
teachin' th' benighted Lutheryan an' other haythin that as a race we're
onvincible an' oncatcheable. Th' Anglo-Saxon race meetin's now going on
in th' Ph'lippeens an' South Africa ought to convince annywan that give
us a fair start an' we can bate th' wurruld to a tillygraft office.

"Th' war our cousins be Sir Thomas Lipton is prosecutin', as Hogan says,
again th' foul but accrate Boers is doin' more thin that. It's givin' us
a common war lithrachoor. I wudden't believe at first whin I r-read th'
dispatches in th' pa-apers that me frind Gin'ral Otis wasn't in South
Africa. It was on'y whin I see another chapter iv his justly cillybrated
seeryal story, intitled 'Th' Capture iv Porac' that I knew he had an
imitator in th' mother counthry. An' be hivins, I like th' English la-
ad's style almost as well as our own gr-reat artist's. Mebbe'tis, as th'
pa-apers say, that Otis has writ himsilf out. Annyhow th' las' chapter
isn't thrillin'. He says: 'To-day th' ar-rmy undher my command fell upon
th' inimy with gr-reat slaughter an' seized th' important town of Porac
which I have mintioned befure, but,' he says, 'we ar-re fortunately now
safe in Manila.' Ye see he doesn't keep up th' intherest to th' end. Th'
English pote does betther."

"'Las' night at eight o'clock,' he says, 'we found our slendher but
inthrepid ar-rmy surrounded be wan hundhred thousan' Boers,' he says.
'We attackted thim with gr-reat fury,' he says, 'pursuin' thim up th'
almost inaccessible mountain side an' capturin' eight guns which we
didn't want so we give thim back to thim with siveral iv our own,' he
says. 'Th' Irish rig'mints,' he says, 'th' Kerry Rifles, th' Land
Leaguers' Own, an' th' Dublin Pets, commanded be th' Pop'lar Irish sojer
Gin'ral Sir Ponsonby Tompkins wint into battle singin' their well-known
naytional anthem: "Mrs. Innery Awkins is a fust-class name!" Th' Boers
retreated,' he says, 'pursued be th' Davitt Terrors who cut their way
through th' fugitives with awful slaughter,' he says. 'They have now,'
he says, 'pinethrated as far us Pretoria,' he says, 'th' officers
arrivin' in first-class carredges an' th' men in thrucks,' he says, 'an'
ar-re camped in th' bettin' shed where they ar-re afforded ivry
attintion be th' vanquished inimy,' he says. 'As f'r us,' he says, 'we
decided afther th' victhry to light out f'r Ladysmith.' he says, 'Th'
inimy had similar intintions,' he says, 'but their skill has been vastly
overrated,' he says. 'We bate thim,' he says 'we bate thim be thirty
miles,' he says. That's where we're sthrong, Hinnissy. We may get licked
on th' battle field, we may be climbin' threes in th' Ph'lippeens with
arrows stickin' in us like quills, as Hogan says, into th' fretful
porcupine or we may be doin' a mile in five minyits flat down th' pike
that leads to Cape Town pursued be th' less fleet but more ignorant
Boers peltin' us with guns full iv goold an' bibles, but in th' pages iv
histhry that our childhren read we niver turned back on e'er an inimy.
We make our own gloryous pages on th' battlefield, in th' camp an' in
th' cab'net meetin'."

"Well, 't is all r-right f'r ye to be jokin'," said Mr. Hennessy, "but
there's manny a brave fellow down there that it's no joke to."

"Thrue f'r ye," said Mr. Dooley, "an' that's why I wisht it cud be fixed
up so's th' men that starts th' wars could do th' fightin'. Th' throuble
is that all th' prelimin'ries is arranged be matchmakers an' all they'se
left f'r fighters is to do th' murdherin'. A man's got a good job at
home an' he wants to make it sthronger. How can he do it? Be throwin'
out some one that's got an akelly good job down th' sthreet. Now he
don't go over as I wud an' say, 'Here Schwartzmeister (or Kruger as th'
case may be) I don't like ye'er appearance, ye made a monkey iv me in
argymint befure th' neighborhood an' if ye continyue in business ye'll
hurt me thrade, so here goes to move ye into th' sthreet!' Not that la-
ad. He gets a crowd around him an' says he: 'Kruger (or Schwartzmeister
as th' case may be) is no good. To begin with he's a Dutchman. If that
ain't enough he's a cantin', hymn singin' murdhrous wretch that wuddent
lave wan iv our counthrymen ate a square meal if he had his way. I'll
give ye all two dollars a week if ye'll go over an' desthroy him.' An'
th' other la-ad, what does he do? He calls in th' neighbors an' says he:
'Dooley is sindin' down a gang iv savages to murdher me. Do ye lave
ye'er wurruk an' ye'er families an' rally ar-round me an' where ye see
me plug hat wave do ye go in th' other direction,' he says, 'an' slay
th' brutal inimy,' he says. An' off goes th' sojers an' they meet a lot
iv la-ads that looks like thimsilves an' makes sounds that's more or
less human an' ates out iv plates an' they swap smokin' tobacco an'
sings songs together an' th' next day they're up early jabbing holes in
each other with baynits. An' whin its all over they'se me an'
Chamberlain at home victoryous an' Kruger an' Schwartzmeister at home
akelly victoryous. An' they make me prime minister or aldherman but whin
I want a man to put in me coal I don't take wan with a wooden leg.

"I'll niver go down again to see sojers off to th' war. But ye'll see me
at th' depot with a brass band whin th' men that causes wars starts f'r
th' scene iv carnage. Whin Congress goes forth to th' sun-kissed an'
rain jooled isles iv th' Passyfic no more heartier cheer will be beard
thin th' wan or two that rises fr'm th' bosom iv Martin Dooley. Says I,
give thim th' chanst to make histhry an' lave th' young men come home
an' make car wheels. If Chamberlain likes war so much 'tis him that
ought to be down there in South Africa peltin' over th' road with ol'
Kruger chasin' him with a hoe. Th' man that likes fightin' ought to be
willin' to turn in an' spell his fellow-counthrymen himsilf. An' I'd
even go this far an' say that if Mack wants to subjoo th' dam
Ph'lippeens----"

"Ye're a thraitor," said Mr. Hennessy.

"I know it," said Mr. Dooley, complacently.

"Ye're an anti-expansionist."

"If ye say that again," cried Mr. Dooley, angrily, "I'll smash in ye'er
head."




UNDERESTIMATING THE ENEMY


"What d'ye think iv th' war?" Mr. Hennessy asked.

"I think I want to go out an' apologize to Shafter," said Mr. Dooley.

"I'm like ivrybody else, be hivins, I thought war was like shootin'
glass balls. I niver thought iv th' glass balls thrainin' a dinnymite
gun on me. 'Tis a thrait iv us Anglo-Saxons that we look on an inimy as
a target. If ye hit him ye get three good see-gars. We're like people
that dhreams iv fights. In me dhreams I niver lost wan fight. A man I
niver saw befure comes up an' says something mane to me, that I can't
raymimber, an' I climb into him an' 'tis all over in a minyit. He niver
hits me, or if he does I don't feel it. I put him on his back an' bate
him to death. An' thin I help mesilf to his watch an' chain an' me
frinds come down an' say, 'Martin, ye haven't a scratch,' an' con-
grathlate me, an' I wandher ar-roun' th' sthreets with a chip on me
shoulder till I look down an' see that I haven't a stitch on me but a
short shirt. An' thin I wake up. Th' list iv knock-outs to me credit in
dhreams wud make Fitzsimmons feel poor. But ne'er a wan iv thim was
printed in th' pa-apers."

"'Tis so with me frinds, th' hands acrost th' sea. They wint to sleep
an' had a dhream. An' says they: 'We will sind down to South Africa thim
gallant throops that have won so manny hard-fought reviews,' they says,
'captained,' they says, 'be th' flower iv our aristocracy,' they says.
'An' whin th' Boers come out ar-rmed with rollin' pins an' bibles,' they
says, 'We'll just go at thim,' they says, 'an' walk through thim an'
that night we'll have a cotillyon at Pretoria to which all frinds is
invited,' they says. An' so they deposit their intellects in th' bank at
home, an' th' absent-minded beggars goes out in thransports iv
pathreetism an' pothry. An' they'se a meetin' iv th' cabinet an' 'tis
decided that as th' war will on'y las' wan week 'twill be well f'r to
begin renamin' th' cities iv th' Thransvaal afther pop'lar English
statesmen--Joechamberlainville an' Rhodesdorp an' Beitfontein. F'r they
have put their hands to th' plough an' th' sponge is squeezed dhry, an'
th' sands iv th' glass have r-run out an' th' account is wiped clean."

"An' what's th' Boer doin' all this time? What's me frind th' Boer
doin'. Not sleepin', Hinnissy, mind ye. He hasn't anny dhreams iv
conquest. But whin a man with long whiskers comes r-ridin' up th' r-road
an' says: 'Jan Schmidt or Pat O'Toole or whativer his name is, ye're
wanted at th' front,' he goes home an' takes a rifle fr'm th' wall an'
kisses his wife an' childher good-bye an' puts a bible in th' tails iv
his coat an' a stovepipe hat on his head an' thramps away. An' his wife
says: 'Good-bye, Jan. Don't be long gone an' don't get shooted.' An' he
says: 'Not while I've got a leg undher me an' a rock in front iv me,' he
says. I tell ye, Hinnissy, ye can't beat a man that fights f'r his home
an' counthry in a stovepipe hat. He might be timpted f'r to come out
fr'm cover f'r his native land, but he knows if he goes home to his wife
with his hat mussed she won't like it, an' so he sets behind a rock an'
plugs away. If th' lid is knocked off he's fatally wounded."

"What's th' raysult, Hinnissy? Th' British marches up with their bands
playin' an' their flags flyin'. An' th' Boers squat behind a bouldher or
a three or set comfortable in th' bed iv a river an' bang away. Their
on'y thradition is that it's betther to be a live Boer thin a dead hero,
which comes, perhaps, to th' same thing. They haven't been taught f'r
hundherds iv years that 'tis a miracle f'r to be an officer an' a
disgrace to be a private sojer. They know that if they're kilt they'll
have their names printed in th' pa-apers as well as th' Markess iv
Doozleberry that's had his eyeglass shot out. But they ain't lookin' f'r
notoriety. All they want is to get home safe, with their counthry free,
their honor protected an' their hats in good ordher. An' so they hammer
away an' th' inimy keeps comin', an' th' varyous editions iv th' London
pa-apers printed in this counthry have standin' a line iv type
beginnin', 'I regret to state.'"

"All this, Hinnissy, comes fr'm dhreamin' dhreams. If th' British had
said, 'This unclean an' raypeecious people that we're against is also
very tough. Dirty though they be, they'll fight. Foul though their
nature is, they have ca'tridges in their belts. This not bein' England
an' th' inimy we have again us not bein' our frinds, we will f'rget th'
gloryous thraditions iv th' English an' Soudan ar-rmies an' instead iv
r-rushin' on thim sneak along yon kindly fence an' hit thim on th' back
iv th' neck,'--they'd be less, 'I r-regret-to-states' and more 'I'm
plazed-to-reports.' They wud so, an' I'm a man that's been through
columns an' columns iv war. Ye'll find, Hinnissy, that 'tis on'y ar-
rmies fights in th' open. Nations fights behind threes an' rocks. Ye can
put that in ye're little book. 'Tis a sayin' I made as I wint along."

"We done th' same way oursilves," said Mr. Hennessy.

"We did that," said Mr. Dooley. "We were in a dhream, too. Th' on'y
thing is th' other fellow was in a thrance. We woke up first. An' anny-
how I'm goin' to apologize to Shafter. He may not have anny medals f'r
standin' up in range iv th' guns but, be hivins, he niver dhrove his
buckboard into a river occypied be th' formerly loathed Castile."




THE WAR EXPERT


Mr. Dooley was reading the war news--not our war news but the war news
we are interested in--when Mr. Hennessy interrupted him to ask "What's a
war expert?"

"A war expert," said Mr. Dooley, "is a man ye niver heerd iv befure. If
ye can think iv annywan whose face is onfamilyar to ye an' ye don't
raymimber his name, an' he's got a job on a pa-aper ye didn't know was
published, he's a war expert. 'Tis a har-rd office to fill. Whin a war
begins th' timptation is sthrong f'r ivry man to grab hold iv a gun an
go to th' fr-ront. But th' war expert has to subjoo his cravin' f'r
blood. He says to himsilf 'Lave others seek th' luxuries iv life in
camp,' he says. 'F'r thim th' boat races acrost th' Tugela, th' romp
over the kopje, an' th' game iv laager, laager who's got th' laager?" he
says. 'I will stand be me counthry,' he says, 'close,' he says. 'If it
falls,' he says, 'it will fall on me,' he says. An' he buys himsilf a
map made be a fortune teller in a dhream, a box iv pencils an' a field
glass, an' goes an' looks f'r a job as a war expert. Says th' editor iv
th' pa-aper: 'I don't know ye. Ye must be a war expert,' he says. 'I
am,' says th' la-ad. 'Was ye iver in a war?' says th' editor. 'I've been
in nawthin' else,' says th' la-ad. 'Durin' th' Spanish-American War, I
held a good job as a dhramatic critic in Dedham, Matsachoosets,' he
says. 'Whin th' bullets flew thickest in th' Soodan I was spoortin'
editor iv th' Christyan Advocate,' he says. 'I passed through th'
Franco-Prooshan War an' held me place, an' whin th' Turks an' Rooshans
was at each other's throats, I used to lay out th' campaign ivry day on
a checker board,' he says. 'War,' he says, has no turrors f'r me,' he
says. 'Ye're th man f'r th' money,' says th' editor. An' he gets th'
job."

"Thin th' war breaks out in earnest. No matther how manny is kilt,
annything that happens befure th' war expert gets to wurruk is on'y what
we might call a prelimin'ry skirmish. He sets down an' bites th' end iv
his pencil an' looks acrost th' sthreet an' watches a man paintin' a
sign. Whin th' man gets through he goes to th' window an' waits to see
whether th' polisman that wint into th' saloon is afther a dhrink or
sarvin' a warrant. If he comes r-right out 'tis a warrant. Thin he sets
back in a chair an' figures out that th' pitchers on th' wall pa-aper
ar-re all alike ivry third row. Whin his mind is thurly tuned up be
these inthricate problems, he dashes to his desk an' writes what you an'
I read th' nex' day in th' pa-apers."

"Clarence Pontoon, th' military expert iv th' London Mornin' Dhram,
reviewin' Gin'ral Buller's position on th' Tugela, says: 'It is manifest
fr'm th' dispatches tellin' that Gin'ral Buller has crost th' Tugela
River that Gin'ral Buller has crost th' Tugela River. This we r-read in
spite iv th' cinsor. Th' question is which side he has crost to. On
Friday he was on th' north side in th' mornin' an' on th' south side at
night, an' in th' river at noon. We heerd nawthin' Sathurdah mornin'.
Th' presumption is that they was nawthin' to hear. Therefore it is aisy
to imagine Gin'ral Buller, findin' his position on th' north side
ontenable an' his position on th' south side onbearable, is
thransportin' his troops up th' river on rafts an' is now engagin' th'
inimy between Spitzozone an' Rottenfontein, two imminsely sthrong
points. All this dimonsthrates th' footility an' foolishness iv
attimptin' to carry a frontal position agains' large, well-fed Dutchmen
with mud in th' fr-ront iv thim."

"'I cal'clate that it wud require thirty millyon thurly dauntless
Britions to ixicute such a manoover, tin Boers ar-rmed with pop bottles
bein' now considhered th' akel iv a brigade. What I wud do if I was
Buller, an' I thank Hivin I'm not, wud be move me ar-rmy in half-an-hour
over th' high but aisily accessible mountains to th' right iv
Crowrijoy's forces, an' takin' off me shoes so he cudden't hear thim
squeak, creep up behind th' Dutch an' lam their heads off. Afther this
sthroke 'twud be aisy f'r to get th' foorces iv Fr-rinch, Gatacre,
Methoon, an' Winston Churchill together some afthernoon, invite th'
inimy to a band concert, surround an' massacree thim. This adroit move
cud be ixicuted if Roberts wud on'y make use iv th' ixicillint bus
sarvice between Hokesmith an' Mikesmith. It is exthraordinary that th'
gin'ral on th' groun' has not seen th' possibilities so apparent at a
distance.'"

"That's wan kind iv war expert, Hinnissy. Another kind is th' wan that
gives it good to th' gover'mint. Says Willum McGlue, war expert iv th'
London Mornin' Growl, who's supposed to be cheek be jowl with Lord
Wolseley. 'England's greatness is slippin' away. Th' failure iv th'
gover'mint to provide a well-equipped, thurly pathriotic ar-rmy iv Boers
to carry on this war undher th' leadership iv gallant Joobert is goin'
to be our roonation. We ar-re bethrayed be a lazy, effete, side-
whiskered, golf-playin' gover'mint that wud rather lose this fight thin
win it because they ar-re tired iv holdin' office. What can be said f'r
public men so lost to shame that they spell Kopje with a "c" an' ar-re
sindin' Englishmen to th' ends iv th' wurruld to fight f'r England? Down
with thim!'"

"Well sir, 'tis a gr-reat thing f'r a counthry to have th' likes iv thim
ar-round to direct manoovers that'd be gatherin' dust on th' shelf if
th' gin'rals had their say, an' to prove to th' wurruld that th' English
ar-re not frivolous, excitable people like us an' th' Frinch, but can
take a batin' without losin' their heads."

"Sure," said Mr. Hennessy, "tis not thim that does th' fightin'. Th' la-
ads with th' guns has that job."

"Well," said Mr. Dooley, "they'se two kinds iv fightin'. Th' experts
wants th' ar-rmy to get into Pretoria dead or alive, an' th' sojers
wants to get in alive. I'm no military expert, Hinnissy. I'm too well
known. But I have me own opinyon on th' war. All this talk about th'
rapid fire gun an' modhren methods iv warfare makes me wondher. They'se
not so much diff'rence between war now an' war whin I was a kid, as they
let on. Th' gun that shoots ye best fr'm a distance don't shoot ye so
well close to. A pile iv mud is a pile iv mud now just th' same as it
was whin Gin'ral Grant was pokin' ar-round. If th' British can get over
th' mud pile they win th' fight. If they can't they're done. That's all
they'se to it. Mos' men, sthrongest backs, best eyes an' th' ownership
iv th' mud piles. That's war, Hinnissy. Th' British have th' men.
They're shy iv backs, eyes an' mud piles, an' they will be until they
larn that sheep-herdin' an' gin'ralship ar-re diff'rent things, an' fill
up their ar-rmy with men that ar-re not fightin' f'r money or glory, but
because they want to get home to their wives alive."

"Ye talk like an' ol book," said Mr. Hennessy, in disgust. "Ye with ye-
re maundhrin' ar-re no betther thin thim expert la-ads."

"Well annyhow," said Mr. Dooley thoughtfully, "th' expert is sarvin' a
useful purpose. Th' papers says th' rapid fire gun'll make war in th'
future impossible. I don't think that, but I know th' expert will."




MODERN EXPLOSIVES


"If iver I wanted to go to war," said Mr. Dooley, "an' I niver did, th'
desire has passed fr'm me iv late. Ivry time I read iv th' desthructive
power iv modhern explosives col' chills chase each other up an' down me
spine."

"What's this here stuff they calls lyddite?" Mr. Hennessy asked.

"Well, 'tis th' divvle's own med'cine," said Mr. Dooley. "Compared with
lyddite joynt powdher is Mrs. Winslow's soothin' surup, an' ye cud lave
th' childher play base-ball with a can iv dinnymite. 'Tis as sthrong as
Gin'ral Crownjoy's camp th' day iv th' surrinder an' almost as sthrong
as th' pollytics iv Montana. Th' men that handles it is cased in six
inch armor an' played on be a hose iv ice wather. Th' gun that shoots it
is always blown up be th' discharge. Whin this deadly missile flies
through th' air, th' threes ar-re withered an' th' little bur-rds falls
dead fr'm th' sky, fishes is kilt in th' rivers, an' th' tillyphone
wires won't wurruk. Th' keen eyed British gunners an' corryspondints
watches it in its hellish course an' tur-rn their faces as it falls into
th' Boer trench. An' oh! th' sickly green fumes it gives off, jus' like
pizen f'r potato bugs! There is a thremenjous explosion. Th' earth is
thrown up f'r miles. Horses, men an' gun carredges ar-re landed in th'
British camp whole. Th' sun is obscured be Boer whiskers turned green.
Th' heart iv th' corryspondint is made sick be th' sight, an' be th'
thought iv th' fearful carnage wrought be this dhread desthroyer in th'
ranks iv th' brave but misguided Dutchmen. Th' nex' day deserters fr'm
th' Boer ranks reports that they have fled fr'm th' camp, needin' a
dhrink an' onable to stand th' scenes iv horror. They announce that th'
whole Boer ar-rmy is as green as wall paper, an' th' Irish brigade has
sthruck because ye can't tell their flag fr'm th' flag iv th' r-rest iv
th' Dutch. Th' Fr-rinch gin'ral in command iv th' Swedish corps lost his
complexion an' has been sint to th' hospital, an' Mrs. Gin'ral
Crownjoy's washin' that was hangin' on th' line whin th' bombardmint
comminced is a total wreck which no amount iv bluin' will save. Th'
deserters also report that manny iv th' Boers ar-re outspannin',
trekkin', loogerin', kopjein' an' veldtin' home to be dyed, f'r'tis not
known whether lyddite is a fast color or will come out in th' wash."

"In spite iv their heavy losses th' Boers kept up a fierce fire. They
had no lyddite, but with their other divvlish modhern explosives they
wrought thremenjous damage. F'r some hours shells burst with turr'ble
precision in th' British camp. Wan man who was good at figures counted
as manny as forty-two thousan' eight hundhred an' sivin burstin' within
a radyus iv wan fut. Ye can imagine th' hor-rible carnage. Colonel C. G.
F. K. L. M. N. O. P. Hetherington-Casey-Higgins lost his eye-glass tin
times, th' las' time almost swallowin' it, while ye'er faithful
corryspondint was rindered deaf be th' explosions. Another Irish
rig'mint has disappearded, th' Twelve Thousandth an' Eighth, Dublin
Fusiliers. Brave fellows, 'tis suspicted they mistook th' explosion of
lyddite f'r a Pathrick's Day procession an' wint acrost to take a look
at it."

"Murdher, but 'tis dhreadful to r-read about. We have to change all our
conciptions iv warfare. Wanst th' field was r-red, now 'tis a br-right
lyddite green. Wanst a man wint out an' died f'r his counthry, now they
sind him out an' lyddite dyes him. What do I mane? 'Tis a joke I made.
I'll not explane it to ye. Ye wudden't undherstand it. 'Tis f'r th'
eddycated classes."

"How they're iver goin' to get men to fight afther this I cudden't tell
ye. 'Twas bad enough in th' ol' days whin all that happened to a sojer
was bein' pinithrated be a large r-round gob iv solder or stuck up on
th' end iv a baynit be a careless inimy. But now-a-days, they have th'
bullet that whin it enthers ye tur-rns ar-round like th' screw iv a
propeller, an' another wan that ye might say goes in be a key-hole an'
comes out through a window, an' another that has a time fuse in it an'
it doesn't come out at all but stays in ye, an' mebbe twinty years
afther, whin ye've f'rgot all about it an' ar-re settin' at home with
ye'er fam'ly, bang! away it goes an' ye with it, carryin' off half iv
th' roof. Thin they have guns as long as fr'm here to th' rollin' mills
that fires shells as big as a thrunk. Th' shells are loaded like a
docthor's bag an' have all kinds iv things in thim that won't do a bit
iv good to man or beast. If a sojer has a weak back there's something in
th' shell that removes a weak back; if his head throubles him, he can
lose it; if th' odher iv vilets is distasteful to him th' shell smothers
him in vilet powdher. They have guns that anny boy or girl who knows th'
typewriter can wurruk, an' they have other guns on th' music box plan,
that ye wind up an' go away an' lave, an' they annoy anny wan that comes
along. They have guns that bounces up out iv a hole in th' groun', fires
a millyon shells a minyit an' dhrops back f'r another load. They have
guns that fire dinnymite an' guns that fire th' hateful, sickly green
lyddite that makes th' inimy look like fiat money, an' guns that fire
canned beef f'r th' inimy an' distimper powdher for th' inimy's horses.
An' they have some guns that shoot straight."

"Well, thin," Mr. Hennessy grumbled, "it's a wondher to me that with all
thim things they ain't more people kilt. Sure, Gin'ral Grant lost more
men in wan day thin th' British have lost in four months, an' all he had
to keep tab on was ol' fashioned bullets an' big, bouncin' iron balls."

"Thrue," said Mr. Dooley. "I don't know th' reason, but it mus' be that
th' betther gun a man has th' more he thrusts th' gun an' th' less he
thrusts himsilf. He stays away an' shoots. He says to himsilf, he says:
'They'se nawthin' f'r me to do,' he says, 'but load up me little lyddite
cannon with th' green goods,' he says, 'an' set here at the organ,' he
says, 'pull out th' stops an' paint th' town iv Pretoria green,' he
says. 'But,' he says, 'on sicond thought, suppose th' inimy shud hand it
back to me,' he says. 'Twud be oncomfortable,' he says. 'So,' he says,
'I'll jus' move me music back a mile,' he says, 'an' peg away, an' th'
longest gun takes th' persimmons,' he says. 'Tis this way: If ye an' I
fall out an' take rifles to each other, 'tis tin to wan nayether iv us
gets clost enough to hit. If we take pistols th' odds is rayjooced. If
we take swords I may get a hack at ye, but if we take a half-nelson lock
'tis even money I have ye'er back broke befure th' polis comes."

"I can see in me mind th' day whin explosives'll be so explosive an'
guns'll shoot so far that on'y th' folks that stay at home'll be kilt,
an' life insurance agents'll be advisin' people to go into th' ar-rmy. I
can so. 'Tis thrue what Hogan says about it."

"What's that?" Mr. Hennessy asked.

"Th' nation," said Mr. Dooley, "that fights with a couplin' pin extinds
its bordhers at th' cost iv th' nation that fights with a clothes pole."

"Well, sir," said Mr. Dooley, "tis a fine rayciption th' Boer dillygates
is havin' in this counthry."

"They'll be out here nex' week," said Mr. Hennessy.

"They will that," Mr. Dooley replied, "an' we'll show thim that our
inthrest in small raypublics fightin' f'r their liberty ain't
disappeared since we become an impeeryal nation. No, sir. We have as
much inthrest as iver, but we have more inthrests elsewhere."

"Oom Paul, he says to th' la-ads: 'Go,' he says, 'to me good an' great
frind, Mack th' Wanst, an' lay th' case befure him,' he says. 'Tell
him,' he says, 'that th' situation is just th' same as it was durin'
Wash'nton's time,' he says, 'on'y Wash'nton won, an' we're rapidly
losin' kopjes till we soon won't have wan to sthrike a match on,' he
says. An' off goes th' good men. Whin they started the Boers was doin'
pretty well, Hinnissy. They were fightin' Englishmen, an' that's a lawn
tinnis to a rale fightin' man. But afther awhile the murdherin' English
gover'mint put in a few recreent but gallant la-ads fr'm th' ol' dart--
we ought to be proud iv thim, curse thim--Pat O'Roberts, an' Mike
McKitchener, an' Terrence O'Fr-rinch--an' they give th' view--halloo an'
wint through th' Dutch like a party comin' home fr'm a fifteenth iv
August picnic might go through a singerbund. So be th' time th'
dillygates got to Europe it was: 'James, if thim br-rave but misguided
Dutch appears, squirt th' garden hose on thim. I'll see th' British
embassadure this afthernoon.' Ye see, Hinnissy, 'twas ol' Kruger's play
to keep on winnin' battles till th' dillygates had their say. Th' amount
iv sympathy that goes out f'r a sthrugglin' people is reg'lated,
Hinnissy, be th' amount iv sthrugglin' th' people can do. Th' wurruld,
me la-ad, is with th' undher dog on'y as long as he has a good hold an'
a chanst to tur-rn over."

"Well, sir, whin th' dillygates see they cudden't do business in Europe,
says they to thimsilves: 'We'll pike acrost th' ragin' sea,' they says,
'an in th' home iv Wash'nton, Lincoln, an' Willum J. Bryan, ye bet we'll
have a hearin',' an' they got wan. Ivrybody's listenin' to thim. But no
wan replies. If they'd come here three months ago, befure Crownjoy was
suffocated out iv his hole in th' groun', they'd be smokin' their pipes
in rockin' chairs on th' veranda iv th' white house an' passin' th'
bucket between thim an' Mack. But 'tis diff'rent now. 'Tis diff'rent
now. Says Willum J. Bryan: 'I can't see thim mesilf, f'r it may not be
long befure I'll have to dale with these inthricate problems, I hope an'
pray, but Congressman Squirtwather, do ye disguise ye'ersilf as a
private citizen an' go down to th' hotel an' tell these la-ads that I'm
with thim quietly if public opinyon justifies it an' Mack takes th'
other side. Tell thim I frequently say to mesilf that they're all r-
right, but I wudden't want it to go further. Perhaps they cud be
injooced to speak at a dimmycratic meetin' unbeknown to me,' he says.

"Sicrety Hay meets thim in a coal cellar, wearin' a mask. 'Gintlemen,'
says he, 'I can assure ye th' prisidint an' mesilf feels mos' deeply f'r
ye. I needn't tell ye about mesilf,' he says. 'Haven't I sint me own son
into ye'er accursed but liberty-lovin' counthry,' he says. 'As f'r Mack,
I assure ye he's hear-rtbroken over th' tur-rn affairs have taken,' he
says. 'Early in th' war he wrote to Lord Salisberry, sayin' he hoped
'twud not be continyued to iliction day, an' Salisberry give him a gruff
response. Tur-rned him down, though both ar-re Anglo-Saxons,' he says.
'Las' night his sobs fairly shook th' white house as he thought iv ye
an' ye'er sthruggle. He wants to tell ye how much he thinks iv ye, an'
he'll meet ye in th' carredge house if ye'll shave off ye'er whiskers
an' go as clam-peddlers. Ye'll reco'nize him in a green livery. He'll
wear a pink carnation in his buttonhole. Give th' names iv Dorsey an'
Flannagan, an' if th' English ambassadure goes by get down on ye'er
ban's an' knees an' don't make a sign till he's out iv sight,' he says.
'Th' stout party in blue near by'll be Mark Hanna. He may be able to
arrange a raypublican meetin' f'r ye to addhress,' he says. 'The gr-
reat hear-rt iv th' raypublican party throbs f'r ye. So does Mack's,' he
says. 'So does mine,' he says."

"Well, th' dillygates met Mack an' they had a pleasant chat. 'Will ye,'
says they, 'inthervene an' whistle off th' dogs iv war?' they says.
'Whisper,' says Mack, th' tears flowin' down his cheeks. 'Iver since
this war started me eyes have been fixed on th' gallant or otherwise,
nation or depindancy, fightin' its brave battle f'r freedom or rebellin'
again' th' sov'reign power, as the case may be,' he says. 'Unofficially,
my sympathy has gone out to ye, an' bur-rnin' wurruds iv unofficial
cheer has been communicated unofficially be me to me official fam'ly,
not, mind ye, as an official iv this magnificent an' liberty-lovin'
raypublic, but as a private citizen,' he says. 'I feel, as a private
citizen, that so long,' he says, 'as the br-right star iv liberty shines
resplindent over our common counthries, with th' example iv Washin'ton
in ye'er eyes, an' th' iliction comin' on, that ye must go forward an'
conker or die,' he says. 'An',' he says, 'Willum McKinley is not th' man
to put annything in ye'er way,' he says. 'Go back to me gr-reat an' good
frind an' tell him that th' hear-rt iv th' raypublican party throbs f'r
him,' he says. 'An' Sicrety Hay's,' he says, 'an' mine,' he says,
'unofficially,' he says. 'Me official hear-rt,' he says, 'is not
permitted be th' constitootion to throb durin' wurrukin' hours,' he
says.

"An' so it goes. Ivrywhere th' dillygates tur-rns they see th' sign:
'This is me busy day.' An' whin they get back home they can tell th'
people they found th' United States exudin' sympathy at ivry pore--
'marked private.'"

"Don't ye think th' United States is enthusyastic f'r th' Boers?" asked
the innocent Hennessy.

"It was," said Mr. Dooley. "But in th' las' few weeks it's had so manny
things to think iv. Th' enthusyasm iv this counthry, Hinnissy, always
makes me think iv a bonfire on an ice-floe. It burns bright so long as
ye feed it, an' it looks good, but it don't take hold, somehow, on th'
ice."




THE CHINESE SITUATION


"Well, sir," said Mr. Hennessy, "to think iv th' audacity iv thim
Chinymen! It do bate all."

"It do that," said Mr. Dooley. "It bates th' wurruld. An' what's it
comin' to? You an' me looks at a Chinyman as though he wasn't good f'r
annything but washin' shirts, an' not very good at that. Tis wan iv th'
spoorts iv th' youth iv our gr-reat cities to rowl an impty beer keg
down th' steps iv a Chinee laundhry, an' if e'er a Chinyman come out to
resint it they'd take him be th' pigtail an' do th' joynt swing with
him. But th' Chinyman at home's a diff'rent la-ad. He's with his frinds
an' they're manny iv thim an' he's rowlin' th' beer kegs himsilf an'
Westhren Civilization is down in th' laundhry wondhrin' whin th'
police'll come along."

"Th' Lord f'rgive f'r sayin' it, Hinnissy, but if I was a Chinyman,
which I will fight anny man f'r sayin,' an' was livin' at home, I'd tuck
me shirt into me pants, put me braid up in a net, an' go out an' take a
fall out iv th' in-vader if it cost me me life. Here am I, Hop Lung
Dooley, r-runnin' me little liquor store an' p'rhaps raisin' a family in
th' town iv Koochoo. I don't like foreigners there anny more thin I do
here. Along comes a bald-headed man with chin whiskers from Baraboo,
Wisconsin, an' says he: 'Benighted an' haythen Dooley,' says he, 'ye
have no God,' he says. 'I have,' says I. 'I have a lot iv thim,' says I.
'Ye ar-re an oncultivated an' foul crather,' he says. 'I have come six
thousan' miles f'r to hist ye fr'm th' mire iv ignorance an' irrellijon
in which ye live to th' lofty plane iv Baraboo,' he says. An' he sets
down on an aisy chair, an' his wife an' her friends come in an' they
inthrojooce Mrs. Dooley to th' modhren improvements iv th' corset an'
th' hat with th' blue bur-rd onto it, an' put shame into her because she
hasn't let her feet grow, while th' head mission'ry reads me a pome out
iv th' _Northwesthren Christyan Advocate_. 'Well,' says I, 'look
here, me good fellow,' I says. 'Me an' me people has occypied these here
primises f'r manny years,' I says, 'an' here we mean to stay,' I says.
'We're doin' th' best we can in th' matther iv gods,' says I. 'We have
thim cast at a first-rate foundhry,' I says, 'an' we sandpa-aper thim
ivry week,' says I. 'As f'r knowin' things,' I says, 'me people wrote
pomes with a markin' brush whin th' likes iv ye was r-runnin' ar-round
wearin' a short pelisse iv sheepskins an' batin' each other to death
with stone hammers,' says I. An' I'm f'r firin' him out, but bein' a
quite man I lave him stay."

"Th' nex' day in comes a man with a suit iv clothes that looks like a
tablecloth in a section house, an' says he: 'Poor ignorant haythen,' he
says, 'what manner iv food d'ye ate?' he says. 'Rice,' says I, 'an' rats
is me fav'rite dish,' I says. 'Deluded wretch,' says he. 'I riprisint
Armour an' Company, an' I'm here to make ye change ye'er dite,' he says.
'Hinceforth ye'll ate th' canned roast beef iv merry ol' stock yards or
I'll have a file iv sojers in to fill ye full iv ondygistible lead,' he
says. An' afther him comes th' man with Aunt Miranda's Pan Cakes an'
Flaked Bran an' Ye'll-perish-if-ye-don't-eat-a-biscuit an' other
riprisintatives iv Westhern Civilization, an' I'm to be shot if I don't
take thim all."

"Thin a la-ad runs down with a chain an' a small glass on three sticks
an' a gang iv section men that answers to th' name iv Casey, an' pro-
ceeds f'r to put down a railroad. 'What's this f'r?' says I. 'We ar-re
th' advance guard iv Westhren Civilization,' he says, 'an we're goin' to
give ye a railroad so ye can go swiftly to places that ye don't want to
see,' he says. 'A counthry that has no railroads is beneath contimpt,'
he says. 'Casey,' he says,'sthretch th' chain acrost yon graveyard,' he
says. 'I aim f'r to put th' thrack just befure that large tombstone
marked Riquiescat in Pace, James H. Chung-a-lung,' he says. 'But,' says
I, 'ye will disturb pah's bones,' says I, 'if ye go to layin' ties,' I
says. 'Ye'll be mixin' up me ol' man with th' Cassidy's in th' nex' lot
that,' I says, 'he niver spoke to save in anger in his life,' I says.
'Ye're an ancestor worshiper, heathen,' says the la-ad, an' he goes on
to tamp th' mounds in th' cimitry an ballast th' thrack with th' remains
iv th' deceased. An' afther he's got through along comes a Fr-rinchman,
an' an Englishman, an' a Rooshan, an' a Dutchman, an' says wan iv them:
'This is a comfortable lookin' saloon,' he says. 'I'll take th' bar, ye
take th' ice-box an' th' r-rest iv th' fixtures.' 'What f'r?' says I.
'I've paid th' rent an' th' license,' says I. 'Niver mind,' says he.
'We're th' riprisintatives iv Westhren Civilization,' he says, 'an' 'tis
th' business iv Westhren Civilization to cut up th' belongings iv
Easthren Civilization,' he says. 'Be off,' he says, 'or I'll pull ye'er
hair,' he says. 'Well,' says I, 'this thing has gone far enough,' I
says. 'I've heerd me good ol' cast-iron gods or josses abused,' I says,
'an' I've been packed full iv canned goods, an' th' Peking Lightnin'
Express is r-runnin' sthraight through th' lot where th' bones iv me
ancesthors lies,' I says. 'I've shtud it all,' I says, 'but whin ye come
here to bounce me off iv me own primises,' I says, 'I'll have to take
th' leg iv th' chair to ye,' I says. An' we're to th' flure."

"That's th' way it stands in Chiny, Hinnissy, an' it looks to me as
though Westhren Civilization was in f'r a bump. I mind wanst whin a
dhrunk prize fighter come up th' r-road and wint to sleep on Slavin's
steps. Some iv th' good sthrong la-ads happened along an' they were near
bein' at blows over who shud have his watch an' who shud take his hat.
While they were debatin' he woke up an' begin cuttin' loose with hands
an' feet, an' whin he got through he made a collection iv th' things
they dhropped in escapin' an' marched ca'mly down th' sthreet. Mebbe
'twill tur-rn out so in Chiny, Hinnissy. I see be th' pa-apers that
they'se four hundherd millyons iv thim boys an' be hivins! 'twuddent
surprise me if whin they got through batin' us at home, they might say
to thimsilves: 'Well, here goes f'r a jaunt ar-roun' the wurruld.' Th'
time may come, Hinnissey, whin ye'll be squirtin' wather over Hop Lee's
shirt while a man named Chow Fung kicks down ye'er sign an' heaves rocks
through ye'er windy. The time may come, Hinnissy. Who knows?"

"End ye'er blather," said Mr. Hennessy. "They won't be anny Chinymen
left whin Imp'ror Willum gets through."

"Mebbe not," says Mr. Dooley. "He's a sthrong man. But th' Chinymen have
been on earth a long time, an' I don't see how we can push so manny iv
thim off iv it. Annyhow, 'tis a good thing f'r us they ain't Christyans
an' haven't larned properly to sight a gun."




MINISTER WU


"Well, sir, me little Chinee frind Woo must be havin' th' time iv his
life in Wash'nton these warm days," said Mr. Dooley.

"Who's he?" asked Mr. Hennessy.

"He's th' Chinee ministher," said Mr. Dooley, "an' his business is f'r
to supply fresh hand-laundhried misinformation to the sicrety iv state.
Th' sicrety iv state is settin' in his office feelin' blue because he's
just heerd be a specyal corryspondint iv th' London Daily Pail at
Sydney, Austhreelya, who had it fr'm a slatewriter in Duluth that an ar-
rmy iv four hundherd an' eight thousan' millyon an' sivinty-five
bloodthirsty Chinee, ar-rmed with flatirnes an' cryin', 'Bung Loo!'
which means, Hinnissy, 'Kill th' foreign divvles, dhrive out th'
missionries, an' set up in Chiny a gover'mint f'r the Chinee,' is
marchin' on Vladivostook in Siberyia, not far fr'm Tinsin."

A knock comes at th' dure an' Woo enthers. 'Well,' says he, with a happy
smile, ''tis all right.' 'What's all right?' says the sicrety iv state.
'Ivrything,' says Woo. 'I have just found a letter sewed in a shirt fr'm
me frind Lie Much, th' viceroy iv Bumbang. It is dated th' fourth hour
iv th' third day iv th' eighth or green-cheese moon,' he says. 'What day
is that?' says the sicrety iv state. 'It's Choosdah, th' fourth iv July;
Winsdah, th' eighth iv October, an' Thursdah, the sivinteenth iv March,'
he says. 'Pathrick's day,' says th' sicrety iv state. 'Thrue f'r ye,'
says Woo. 'What year?' says Jawn Hay. 'The year iv th' big wind,' says
Woo. 'Good,' says John Hay, 'proceed with ye'er story.' 'Here's th'
letther,' says Woo. 'I know 'tis genooyine because it is an ol' dhress
patthern used be th' impress. It says: 'Oscar Woo, care iv himsilf,
annywhere: Dear Woo, brother iv th' moon, uncle iv th' sun, an' roommate
iv th' stars, dear sir: Yours iv th' eighth day iv th' property moon
rayceived out iv th' air yesterdah afthernoon or to-morrow, an' was glad
to note ye ar-re feelin' well. Ivrything over here is th' same ol' pair
iv boots. Nawthin' doin'. Peking is as quiet as th' gr-rave. Her
majesty, th' impress, is sufferin' slightly fr'm death be poison, but is
still able to do th' cookin' f'r the Rooshan ambassadure. Th' impror was
beheaded las' week an' feels so much betther f'r the op'ration that he
expicts to be quarthered nex' Sundah. He's always wanted to rayjooce his
weight. Some iv th' Boxers called on th' foreigners at Tinsin las' week
an' met a warrum rayciption. Th' foreigners aftherward paid a visit to
thim through a hole in th' wall, an' a jolly day concluded with a foot
race, at which our people are becomin' expert. Some iv th' boys expicts
to come up to Peking nex' week, an' th' people along th' line iv th'
railroad are gettin' ready f'r thim. This is really all the news I have,
excipt that cherries ar-re ripe. Me pin is poor, me ink is dhry, me love
f'r you can niver die. Give me regards to Sicrety Hay whin he wakes up.
I remain, illusthrus cousin iv th' risin' dawn, thruly ye'ers, Li.

P. S.--If ye need anny more information take a longer dhraw.'

"'That,' says Woo, 'is wan way iv r-readin' it. Read upside down it says
that the impress has become a Swedenboorjan. I will r-read it standin'
on me head whin I get home where I can pin down me overskirt; thin I'll
r-read it in a lookin' glass; thin I'll saw it into sthrips an' r-run it
through a wringer an' lave it stand in a tub iv bluein', an' whin its
properly starched I'll find out what it says. Fin'lly I'll cut it into
small pieces an' cook with rice an' lave it to rest in a cool place, an'
thin 'twill r-read even betther. I hope ye're satisfied,' he says. 'I
am,' says Jawn Hay. 'I'll tillygraft to Mark that ivrything is all r-
right,' he says, 'an' that our relations with his majesty or her majesty
or their Boxerships or th' Down-with-th'-foreign-divvlers or whoiver's
runnin' th' shop over beyant are as they ought to be or worse or
betther, as th' case may be,' he says. 'Good,' says Woo, 'ye're a man
afther me own heart,' he says. 'I'll sind ye a little book wrote be a
frind iv mine in Peking,' he says. ''Tis called "Heart to Heart Lies I
Have Had," he says. 'Ye'll like it,' he says. 'In the manetime,' he
says, 'I must write a secret message to go out be to-night's hot-air
express to me corryspondint in Meriden, Connecticut, urgin' him to sind
more im-peeryal edicks iv a fav'r-able nature,' he says. 'I've on'y had
twinty so far, an' I'm gettin' scrivener's palsy,' he says. 'But befure
I go,' he says, 'I bet ye eight millyon yens, or three dollars an'
eighty-four cints iv ye'er money, that ye can't pick out th' shell this
here pea is undher,' he says. An' they set down to a game iv what is
known at Peking as diplomacy, Hinnissy, but on Randolph sthreet viadock
is called the double dirty."

"I don't believe wan wurrud iv what's in th' pa-apers about Chiny," said
Mr. Hennessy.

"Well," said Mr. Dooley, "if ye believe annything ye'll believe
ivrything. 'Tis a grand contist that's goin' on between Westhren an'
Easthren civilliezation. 'Tis a joke iv me own, Hinnissy, an' ye'd
undherstand it if ye knew spellin. Th' Westhren civilization, Hinnissy
--that's us--is a pretty good liar, but he's a kind iv rough-an'-tumble
at it. He goes in head down, an' ivry lie he tells looks like all th'
others. Ye niver see an Englishman that had anny judgment in lyin'. Th'
corryspondint iv th' Daily Pail is out iv his class. He's carryin' lies
to Lieville. How in th' wurruld can we compete with a counthry where
ivry lab'rer's cottage projooces lies so delicate that th' workmen iv
th' West can't undherstand thim? We make our lies be machinery; they
tur-rn out theirs be hand. They imitate th' best iv our canned lies to
deceive people that likes that kind, but f'r artists they have lies that
appeals to a more refined taste. Sure I'd like to live among thim an'
find out th' kind iv bouncers they tell each other. They must be gr-
rand. I on'y know their export lies now--th' surplus lies they can't use
at home. An' th' kind they sind out ar-re betther thin our best. Our
lies is no more thin a conthradiction iv th' thruth; their lies appeals
to th' since iv honesty iv anny civilized man."

"They can't hurt us with their lies," said Mr. Hennessy of our Western
civilization. "We have th' guns an' we'll bate thim yet"

"Yes," said Mr. Dooley, "an' 'twill be like a man who's had his house
desthroyed be a cyclone gettin' up an' kickin' at th' air."




THE FUTURE OF CHINA


"Be th' time th' Chinese gets through with this here job o' theirs,"
said Mr. Dooley, "they'll know a thing or two about good manners an'
Christyan idees."

"They need thim," said Mr. Hennessy.

"They do so," said Mr. Dooley. "An' they'll get thim. By an' by th'
allied foorces will proceed to Peking. It may not be in ye'er life time
or in mine, or in th' life time iv th' ministhers, Hinnissy. They ar-re
in no hurry. Th' ministhers ar-re as comfortable as they can be on a
dite iv polo ponies an' bamboo, an' they have exercise enough dodgin'
cannon balls to have no fear iv indygisthion. They'se no need of haste.
Th' allied foorces must take no step forward while wan ar-rmed foe
survives. It was rayported last week that th' advance had begun, but on
sindin' out scouts 'twas discovered that th' asphalt road to th' capital
was not r-ready an' th' gallant sojer boys was afraid to risk their
beecycles on a defictive pavement. Thin th' parlor cars ordhered be th'
Rooshan admiral has not arrived an' wan iv th' Frinch gin'rals lost an
omelette, or whativer 'tis they wear on their shouldhers, an' he won't
budge till it can be replaced fr'm Pahrs. A sthrong corps iv miners an'
sappers has gone ahead f'r to lo-cate good resthrants on th' line iv
march, but th' weather is cloudy an' th' silk umbrellys haven't arrived,
an' they'se supposed to be four hundhred millyon Chiny-men with
pinwheels an' Roman candles blockin' th' way, so th' advance has been
postponed indifinitely. Th' American foorces is r-ready f'r to start
immejately, but they ar-re not there yet. Th' British gin'ral is waitin'
f'r th' Victorya cross befure he does annything, an' th' Japanese an'
th' Rooshan is dancin' up an' down sayin' 'Afther you, me boy.'"

"But afther awhile, whin th' frost is on th' pumpkin an' th' corn is in
th' shock, whin th' roads has been repaired, an' ivry gin'ral's lookin'
his best, an' in no danger iv a cold on th' chist, they'll prance away.
An' whin they get to th' city iv Peking a fine cillybration is planned
be th' mission'ries. I see th' programme in th' pa-aper: First day, 10
A.M., prayers be th' allied mission'ries; 1 P.M., massacree iv the
impress an' rile fam'ly; sicond day, 10 A.M., scatthrin' iv remains iv
former kings; 11 A.M., disecration iv graves gin'rally; 2 P.M.,
massacree iv all gin'rals an' coort officials; third day, 12 noon,
burnin' iv Peking; foorth day, gran' pop'lar massacree an' division iv
territ'ry, th' cillybration to close with a rough-an'-tumble fight among
th' allies."

"'Twill be a gr-reat occasion, Hinnissy, an' be-dad I'd like to be there
to see it. Ye can't go too sthrong again' th' Chinee. Me frind th'
impror iv Germany put it right. 'Brave boys,' says he, 'ye ar-re goin'
out now,' he says, 'f'r to carry th' light iv Christyanity,' he says,
'an' th' teachin's iv th' German Michael,' he says, 'to th' benighted
haythen beyant,' he says. 'Me an' Mike is watchin' ye' he says, 'an' we
ixpict ye to do ye'er duty,' he says. 'Through you,' he says, 'I propose
to smash th' vile Chinee with me mailed fist,' he says. 'This is no six-
ounce glove fight, but demands a lunch-hook done up in eight-inch armor
plate,' he says. 'Whin ye get among th' Chinee,' he says, 'raymimber
that ye ar-re the van guard iv Christyanity,' he says, 'an' stick ye'er
baynet through ivry hated infidel ye see,' he says. 'Lave thim
undherstand what our westhren civilization means,' he says, 'an' prod
thim good an' hard,' he says. 'Open their heads with ye'er good German
swords to Eu-ropyan culture an' refinement,' he says. 'Spare no man that
wears a pigtail,' he says. 'An,' he says, 'me an' th' German Michael
will smile on ye as ye kick th' linin' out iv th' dhragon an' plant on
th' walls iv Peking th' banner,' he says, 'iv th' cross, an',' he says,
'th' double cross,' he says. 'An' if be chance ye shud pick up a little
land be th' way, don't lave e'er a Frinchman or Rooshan take it fr'm ye,
or ye'll feel me specyal delivery hand on th' back iv ye'er neck in a
way that'll do ye no kind iv good. Hock German Michael,' he says, 'hock
me gran'father, hoch th' penny postage fist,' he says, 'hock mesilf,' he
says. An th' German impror wint back to his bedroom f'r to wurruk on th'
book he's goin' to br-ring out nex' year to take th' place iv th' bible.

"He's th' boy f'r me money. Whin th' German throops takes their part in
th' desthruction iv Peking they'll be none iv th' allied foorces 'll
stick deeper or throw th' backbone iv th' impress' ol' father higher
thin th' la-ads fr'm th' home iv th' sausage. I hope th' cillybration
'll occur on Chris'mas day. I'd like to hear th' sojers singin' 'Gawd r-
rest ye, merry Chinnymen' as they punchered thim with a baynit."

"'Twill be a good thing," said Mr. Hennessy.

"It will that," said Mr. Dooley.

"'Twill civilize th' Chinnymen," said Mr. Hennessy.

"'Twill civilize thim stiff," said Mr. Dooley. "An' it may not be a bad
thing f'r th' r-rest iv th' wurruld. Perhaps contack with th' Chinee may
civlize th' Germans."




PLATFORM MAKING


"That sthrikes me as a gran' platform," said Mr. Hennessy. "I'm with it
fr'm start to finish."

"Sure ye are," said Mr. Dooley, "an' so ye'd be if it begun: 'We
denounce Terence Hinnissy iv th' Sixth Ward iv Chicago as a thraitor to
his country, an inimy iv civilization, an' a poor thing.' Ye'd say:
'While there are wan or two things that might be omitted, th' platform
as a whole is a statesmanlike docymint, an' wan that appeals to th'
intelligince iv American manhood.' That's what ye'd say, an' that's what
all th' likes iv ye'd say. An' whin iliction day comes 'round th' on'y
question ye'll ast ye'ersilf is: 'Am I with Mack or am I with Billy
Bryan?' An accordin'ly ye'll vote."

"'Tis always th' same way, an' all platforms is alike. I mind wanst whin
I was an alter-nate to th' county con-vintion--'twas whin I was a power
in pollytics an' th' on'y man that cud do annything with th' Bohemian
vote--I was settin' here wan night with a pen an' a pot iv ink befure
me, thryin' to compose th' platform f'r th' nex' day, f'r I was a lithry
man in a way, d'ye mind, an' I knew th' la-ads'd want a few crimps put
in th' raypublicans in a ginteel style, an' 'd be sure to call on me f'r
to do it. Well, I'd got as far down as th' tariff an' was thryin' f'r to
express me opinyon without swearin', whin who shud come in but Lafferty,
that was sicrety iv McMahon, that was th' Main Guy in thim days, but
aftherward thrun down on account iv him mixin' up between th' Rorkes an'
th' Dorseys. Th' Main Guy Down Town said he wudden't have no throuble in
th' ward, an' he declared McMahon out. McMahon had too much money
annyhow. If he'd kept on, dollar bills'd have been extinct outside iv
his house. But he was a sthrong man in thim days an' much liked."

"Anyhow, Lafferty, that was his sicrety, come in, an' says he: 'What are
ye doin' there?' says he. 'Step soft,' says I; 'I am at wurruk,' I says.
'Ye shudden't do lithry wurruk on an empty stomach,' says he. 'I do
nawthin' on an empty stomach but eat,' says I. 'I've had me supper,' I
says. 'Go 'way,' says I, 'till I finish th' platform,' I says. 'What's
th' platform?' says he.'F'r th' county con-vintion,' says I.

"Well, sir, he set down on a chair, an' I thought th' man was goin' to
die right there on the premises with laughter. 'Whin ye get through with
ye'er barkin',' says I, 'I'll throuble ye to tell me what ye may be
doin' it f'r,' I says. 'I see nawthin' amusin' here but ye'er prisince,'
I says, 'an' that's not a divvle iv a lot funnier than a wooden leg,' I
says, f'r I was mad. Afther awhile he come to, an' says he: 'Ye don't
raally think,' says he, 'that ye'll get a chanct to spring that
platform,' he says. 'I do,' says I. 'Why,' he says, 'the platform has
been adopted,' he says. 'Whin?' says I. 'Befure ye were born,' says he.
'In th' reign iv Bildad th' first,' says he--he was a larned man, was
Lafferty, though a dhrinkin' man. All sicreties iv pollyticians not in
office is dhrinkin' men, Hinnissy. 'Ive got th' copy iv it here in me
pocket,' he says. 'Th' boss give it to me to bring it up to date,' he
says. 'They was no sthrike last year an' we've got to put a sthrike
plank in th' platform or put th' prisident iv th' Lumber Shovers' union
on th' county board, an',' he says, 'they ain't room,' he says.

"'Why,' says Lafferty, 'ye ought to know th' histhry iv platforms,' he
says. An' he give it to me, an' I'll give it to ye. Years ago, Hinnissy,
manny years ago, they was a race between th' dimmycrats an' th'
raypublicans f'r to see which shud have a choice iv principles. Th'
dimmycrats lost. I dinnaw why. Mebbe they stopped to take a dhrink.
Annyhow, they lost. Th' raypublicans come up an' they choose th' 'we
commind' principles, an' they was nawthin' left f'r the dimmycrats but
th' 'we denounce an' deplores.' I dinnaw how it come about, but th'
dimmycrats didn't like th' way th' thing shtud, an' so they fixed it up
between thim that whichiver won at th' iliction shud commind an'
congratulate, an' thim that lost shud denounce an' deplore. An' so it's
been, on'y the dimmycrats has had so little chanct f'r to do annything
but denounce an' deplore that they've almost lost th' use iv th' other
wurruds.

"Mack sets back in Wash'nton an' writes a platform f'r th' comity on
risolutions to compose th' week afther. He's got a good job--forty-nine
ninety-two, sixty-six a month--an' 'tis up to him to feel good. 'I--I
mean we,' he says, 'congratulate th' counthry on th' matchless
statesmanship, on-shrinkin' courage, steady devotion to duty an'
principle iv that gallant an' hon'rable leader, mesilf,' he says to his
sicrety. 'Take that,' he says, 'an' elaborate it,' he says. 'Ye'll find
a ditchnry on th' shelf near the dure,' he says, 'if ye don't think I've
put what I give ye sthrong enough,' he says. 'I always was,' he says,
'too retirin' f'r me own good,' he says. 'Spin out th' r-rest,' he says,
'to make about six thousan' wurruds,' he says, 'but be sure don't write
annything too hot about th' Boer war or th' Ph'lippeens or Chiny, or th'
tariff, or th' goold question, or our relations with England, or th'
civil sarvice,' he says. 'Tis a foolish man,' he says,'that throws a
hunk iv coal fr'm his own window at th' dhriver iv a brick wagon,' he
says."

"But with Billy Bryan 'tis diff'rent. He's out in Lincoln, Neebrasky,
far fr'm home, an' he says to himsilf: 'Me throat is hoarse, an' I'll
exercise me other fac'lties,' he says. 'I'll write a platform,' he says.
An' he sets down to a typewriter, an' denounces an' deplores till th'
hired man blows th' dinner horn. Whin he can denounce an' deplore no
longer he views with alarm an' declares with indignation. An' he sinds
it down to Kansas City, where th' cot beds come fr'm."

"Oh, ye're always pitchin' into some wan," said Mr. Hennessy. "I bet ye
Willum Jennings Bryan niver see th' platform befure it wint in. He's too
good a man."

"He is all iv that," said Mr. Dooley. "But ye bet he knows th' rale
platform f'r him is: 'Look at th' bad breaks Mack's made,' an' Mack's
platform is: 'Ye'd get worse if ye had Billy Bryan.' An' it depinds on
whether most iv th' voters ar-re tired out or on'y a little tired who's
ilicted. All excipt you, Hinnissy. Ye'll vote f'r Bryan?"

"I will," said Mr. Hennessy.

"Well," said Mr. Dooley, "d'ye know, I suspicted ye might."




THE YACHT RACES


"In th' ol' times whin I was a yachtsman--" began Mr. Dooley.

"Scowman," said Mr. Hennessy.

"Yachtsman," said Mr. Dooley. "Whin I was a yachtsman, all a man needed
to race was a flat-bottomed boat, an umbrella, an' a long dhrink. In
thim days 'twas 'Up with th' mainsail an' out with th' jib, an' Cap'n
Jawn first to th' Lake View pumpin' station f'r th' see-gars.' Now 'tis
'Ho, f'r a yacht race. Lave us go an' see our lawyers.' 'Tis 'Haul away
on th' writ iv ne exeat,' an' 'Let go th' peak capias.' 'Tis 'Pipe all
hands to th' Supreme Coort.' 'Tis 'A life on th' boundin' docket an' a
home on th' rowlin' calendar.' Befure we die, Sir Lipton'll come over
here f'r that Cup again an' we'll bate him be gettin' out an overnight
injunction. What's th' use iv buildin' a boat that's lible to tip an'
spill us all into th' wet? Turn th' matther over to th' firm iv Wiggins,
Schultz, O'Mally, Eckstein, Wopoppski, Billotti, Gomez, Olson, an'
McPherson, an' lave us have th' law on him."

"I don't suppose, Hinnissy, I ought to be gettin' off me little jokes on
a seeryous matther like this. What's it all about, says ye? Well, ye
see, 'tis this way. Wanst befure th' war some la-ad fr'm this counthry
took a boat acrost th' Atlantic an' run it again an English boat an' iv
coorse, he won, not bein' tied to th' dock, an' they give him a Cup. I
don't know why they give him a cup, but they give him a cup. He brought
it back here an' handed it to a yacht club, which is an assocyation,
Hinnissy, iv mimbers iv th' Bar. He says: 'Ye keep that cup on ye'er
mantle-piece an' if e'er an Englishman wants it, don't ye give it to
him.' Afther awhile, an Englishman that ownded a boat come afther th'
cup, an 'twas lave go altogether, an' th' las' man to th' line knows
what he is. He's an Englishman, iv coorse. That was all r-right too. But
th' time come whin th' lagal pro-fission took a hand in th' game. 'Look
here,' says they. 'Ye've vilated nearly all th' statues iv th' State iv
Noo Jarsey already,' they says, 'an' if ye ain't careful, ye'll be
hauled up f'r contimpt iv coort,' they says. So they took th' matther in
hand an' dhrew up th' r-right pa-apers. 'State iv Noo York, county iv
Cook, s. s. Know all men be these prisints. To all magisthrates an'
polis officers, greetin.' In re Sir Lipton again th' Cup. Ordhered that
if Sir Lipton shall secure said Cup fr'm aforesaid (which he won't) he
must build a boat as follows: Wan hundherd an' twinty chest, fifty-four
waist, hip an' side pockets, carryin' three hundherd an' sixty-three
thousan' cubic feet iv canvas; th' basement iv th' boat to be papered in
green with yellow flowered dado, open plumbin', steam heat throughout,
th' tinant to pay f'r all repairs. Be means iv this infernal machine, if
enable to kill off th' rile fam'ly, he will attimpt to cross th' stormy
Atlantic, an' if successful, will arrive at th' risidince iv th' party
of th' first part, said John Doe. Wanst there, he will consult with
mimbers iv th' Noo York Bar Association, who will lead him to a firm iv
competent expert accountants, who will give him his time, which is two
minyits measured be th' invarse ratio iv th' distance fr'm th' binnacle
to th' cook-stove, an' fr'm th' cook-stove, east be north to th'
bowspirit. He will thin take his foolish boat down th' bay, an' if he
keeps his health, he can rayturn to th' grocery business, f'r he's a
jolly good fellow which nobody can deny.'

"Ye can see this, Hinnissy, that yachtin' has become wan iv thl larned
pro-fissions. 'Tis that that got th' la-ad fr'm Boston into it. They's a
jolly Jack Tar f'r ye. In dhrawin' up a lease or framin' a bond, no more
gallant sailor rides th' waves thin hearty Jack Larsen iv th'
Amalgamated Copper Yacht Club. 'What ho?' says he. 'If we're goin' to
have a race,' he says, 'shiver me timbers if I don't look up th' law,'
he says. So he become a yachtsman. 'But,' says th' Noo York la-ads, thim
that has th' Cup on their mantel-piece, 'Ye can race on'y on two
conditions.' 'What ar-re they?' says Larsen. 'Th' first is that ye
become a mimber iv our club.' 'With pleasure,' says he. 'Ye can't,' says
they. 'An' havin' complied with this first condition, ye must give us
ye'er boat,' says they. 'We don't want it,' they says. 'Th' terms suit
me entirely,' says Cap. Larsen. 'I'm a simple sailor man an' I'll give
ye me boat undher th' following conditions,' he says. 'First, that ye
won't take it; second, that ye'll paint me name on th' side iv it in red
letters, three feet high; third, that ye'll inthra-jooce me to th'
Prince iv Wales; foorth, that I'll sail it mesilf. Nawthin',' he says,
'wud give me gr-reater pleasure thin to have me handsome an' expinsive
raft in th' hands iv men who I wud considher it an honor to know,' he
says. 'An' so,' he says, 'I'll on'y ask ye to sign a bond an' lave a
small security, say about five hundherd thousan' dollars, in me hands in
case anny paint shud be knocked off me boat," he says. 'Yachtin' is a
gintleman's spoort,' he says, 'an' in dalin' with gintlemen,' he says,
'ye can't be too careful,' he says."

"What's Sir Lipton doin' all this time?" asked Mr. Hennessy.

"He's preparin' his bond, makin' his will, an' goin' through th' other
lagal preliminaries iv th' race. He's built a boat too. Th' King of
England was aboord iv her, an' he was near killed, be havin' a mast fall
on him. Th' Lord knows how he escaped. A mass iv steel weighin' a
hundherd thousan' ton fell on his Majesty an' bounced off. Sir Lipton
felt pretty bad about it. He didn't mind losin' a mast or two, but he
didn't want annywan to know he had th' king aboord. 'Twud hurt business.
'Boys,' says he to th' rayporthers, 'th' King's on me yacht. D'ye hear
me? Th' King's on me yacht. But don't say annything about it. I don't
want to have it known. Don't print it onless ye have to, an' thin put it
in an inconspicuous place, like th' first page. He's here sure enough,
boys. Th' mast just fell on his Majesty. It nearly kilt him. I'm not
sure it didn't kill him. He remained perfectly cool throughout. So did
I. I was almost cold. So did both iv us. But, mind not a wurrud iv this
in th' pa-apers.' I don't know how th' rayporthers got hold iv it. But
they're a pryin' lot."

"How did th' mast come to fall?" asked Mr. Hennessy, eagerly. "D'ye
suppose Sir Lipton is wan iv us?"

"S-sh," said Mr. Dooley, adding, softly, "he was bor-rn in Limerick."




POLYGAMY


"How manny wives has this here man Roberts that's thryin' to break into
Congress?" Mr. Dooley asked.

"I dinnaw," said Mr. Hennessy; "I nivver heerd iv him."

"I think it's three," said Mr. Dooley. "No wondher he needs wurruk an'
is fightin' hard f'r th' job. I'm with him too, be hivens. Not that I'm
be taste or inclination a marryin' man, Hinnissy. They may get me to th'
altar some day. Th' best iv us falls, like Cousin George, an' there ar-
re designin' women in this very block that I have me own throubles in
dodgin'. But anny time ye hear iv me bein' dhrawn fr'm th' quite
miseries an' exclusive discomforts iv single life ye may know that they
have caught me asleep an' chloroformed me. It's thrue. But f'r thim that
likes it, it's all r-right, an' if a man's done something in his youth
that he has to do pinance f'r an' th' stations iv th' cross ain't
sthrong enough, lave him, says I, marry as manny women as he wants an'
live with them an' die contint. Th' Mormons thinks they ar-re commanded
be the Lord f'r to marry all th' ineligeable Swede women. Now, I don't
believe th' Lord iver commanded even a Mormon f'r to do annything so
foolish, an' if he did he wudden't lave th' command written on a pie-
plate an' burrid out there at Nauvoo, in Hancock county, Illinye. Ye can
bet on that, Hinnissy."

"But if anny wan believes 'twas done, I say, lave him believe it an'
lave him clasp to his bosom as manny Olesons as 'll have him. Sure in
th' prisint state iv th' mathrimonyal market, as Hogan calls it, whin he
goes down to coort th' rich Widow O'Brien, th' la-ad that wants to
engage in interprises iv that sort ought to have a frind in ivry wan but
th' men that keeps imploymint agencies.

"But no. Th' minyit a Mormon thries to break into a pollytical job, a
dillygation rises an' says they: 'What!' they says, 'permit this
polluted monsther f'r to invade th' chaste atmosphere,' they says, 'iv
th' house iv riprisintatives,' they says. 'Permit him f'r to parade his
fam'ly down Pinnsylvanya Av'noo an' block thraffic,' they says. 'Permit
him mebbe to set in th' chair wanst occypied be th' laminted
Breckinridge,' they says. An' they proceed f'r to hunt th' poor, crowded
man. An' he takes a day off to kiss his wife fr'm house to house, an'
holds a meetin' iv his childher to bid thim good-by an' r-runs to hide
in a cave till th' dillygation raymimbers that they have husbands iv
their own an' goes home to cook th' supper.

"A Mormon, Hinnissy, is a man that has th' bad taste an' th' rellijion
to do what a good manny other men ar-re restrained fr'm doin' be
conscientious scruples an' th' polis. I don't want anny wife; ye,
Hinnissy, ar-re satisfied, not to say con-tint, with wan; another la-ad
feels that he'd be lonesome without tin. 'Tis a matther iv disposition.
If iver I got started th' Lord on'y knows where I'd bring up. I might be
like me frind an' fellow-sultan, Hadji Mohammed. Hadji has wives to
burn, an' wanst in awhile he bur-rns wan. He has a betther job thin
Congressman."

"Th' best a congressman can get is foorth-class postmasther an' a look
in at th' White House on visitin' day. But Hadji, th' pop'lar an'
iloquent sultan iv Sulu an' Bazeen iv th' Ohio iv th' Passyfic, owns his
own palace an' disthributes his own jobs. No man can hold th' office iv
bow-sthringer iv our impeeryal domain without a certy-ficate fr'm Hadji.
From th' highest office in th' land to th' lowest, fr'm th' chief
pizener to th' throne, to th' humblest ixicutioner that puts a lady in a
bag an' dumps her into th' lake in th' Nine Millionth Assimbly district
they look to Hadji Mohammed f'r their places. He is th' High Guy, th'
Main Thing. He's ivrybody. When he quits wurrk th' governmint is over
f'r th' day. An' does annywan thry to interfere with Hadji? Does annywan
say 'Hadji, ye'll have to abandon two or three hundherd iv ye 'er
firesides. Ye ar-re livin' jus' inside th' left field fince iv our
domain an' 'tis a rule iv th' game that we've taken ye into that no wan
shall have more thin wan wife at a time that annywan knows iv. In'
behalf iv th' comity iv th' Society f'r th' Supprission iv Poly-gamy, I
request ye to discard Nora an' Eileen an' Mary Ann an' Sue an' Bimbi an'
th' r-rest iv th' bunch, an' cleave on'y to Lucille. I judge be her
looks that she's th' first Missus Haitch.'

"No, sir. If he did he'd reach th' ship that runs between our outlying
wards without a hair to his head. Instead iv reproachin' Hadji with his
domestic habits, wan iv th' envoys that ar-re imployed in carryin'
messages fr'm th' prisidint to his fellow-citizens, proceeds to th'
pretty little American village iv Sulu, where he finds Hadji settin' up
on a high chair surrounded be wives. 'Tis a domestic scene that'd make
Brigham Young think he was a bachelor. Hadji is smokin' a good seegar
an' occasionally histin' a dhrink iv cider, an' wan iv th' ladies is
playin' a guitar, an' another is singin' 'I want ye my Sulu,' an'
another is makin' a tidy, an' three or four hundred more ar-re sewin'
patches on th' pants iv th' Hadji kids. An' th' ambassadure he says:
'Mos' rile an' luminous citizen, here is a copy iv th' Annual
Thanksgivin' pro-clamation,' he says. 'Tis addhressed to all th' hearty
husbandmen iv our belovid counthry, manin' you among others,' he says.
'An' here,' he says, 'is th' revised constitution,' he says. 'Th'
original wan,' he says, 'was intinded f'r ol' stick-in-th'-muds that
wudden't know th' difference between a harem an' a hoe,' he says. 'This
wan,' he says, 'is more suited f'r th' prisint gay an' expansive times,'
he says. 'It permits a man to cleave to as manny wives,' he says, 'as
his race, color, an' prevyous condition iv servitude will permit,' he
says. 'Thank ye kindly,' says Hadji, 'I'll threasure these here papers
as a vallyable meminto fr'm that far distant home iv mine which I have
niver see,' he says. 'I'd inthrojooce ye to Mrs. Hadji wan by wan,' he
says, 'but 'twud be betther,' he says, 'f'r to stand up here an' be
prisinted to her as a whole,' he says, 'f'r,' he says, ''tis growing
late an' I want ye to come up to th' house,' he says, 'an' pick a
mission'ry with me,' he says. 'A Baptist,' he says, 'raised on th'
farm,' he says. An' Hadji holds his job an' looks for'rard to th' day
whin we'll have female suffrage an' he can cast th' solid vote iv Sulu
for himsilf f'r prisident."

"Thin," said Mr. Hennessy, "ye'er frind Roberts ought to move to what-
d'ye-call-th' place."

"That's what I'm thinkin'," said Mr. Dooley. "But 'tis too bad f'r him
he was bor-rn at home."




PUBLIC FICKLENESS


Mr. Dooley put his paper aside and pushed his spectacles up on his
forehead. "Well," he said, "I suppose, afther all, we're th' mos'
lively nation in th' wurruld. It doesn't seem many months ago since ye,
Hinnissy, was down at th' depot cheerin' th' departin' heroes----"

"I niver was," said Mr. Hennessey. "I stayed at home."

"Since ye was down cheerin' th' departin' heroes," Mr. Dooley continued,
"an' thryin' to collect what they owed ye. Th' papers was full iv news
iv th' war. Private Jawn Thomas Bozoom iv Woonsocket, a mimber iv th'
gallant an' devoted Wan Hundhred an' Eighth Rhode Island, accidentally
slipped on a orange peel while attimptin' to lave th' recruitin' office
an' sustained manny con-tu-sions. He rayfused to be taken home an'
insisted on jinin' his rig'mint at th' rayciption in th' fair groun's.
Gallant Private Bozoom! That's th' stuff that American heroes ar-re made
iv. Ye find thim at th' forge an' at th' plough, an' dhrivin' sthreet
cars, an' ridin' in th' same. The favored few has th' chanst to face th'
bullets iv th'inimy. 'Tis f'r these unknown pathrites to prove that a
man can sarve his counthry at home as well as abroad. Private Bozoom
will not be f'rgot be his fellow-counthrymen. A rayciption has been
arranged f'r him at th' Woonsocket op'ry-house, an' 'tis said if he will
accipt it, th' vote iv th' State iv Rhode Island'll be cast f'r him f'r
prisidint. 'Tis at such times as this that we reflict that th' wurruld
has wurruk f'r men to do, an' mere politicians mus' retire to th' rear."

"That was a few months ago. Where's Bozoom now? If iver ye go to
Woonsocket, Hinnissy, which Gawd f'rbid, ye'll find him behind th'
counther iv th' grocery store ladlin' out rutabaga turnips into a brown
paper cornucopy an' glad to be alive. An' 'tis tin to wan, an' more thin
that, that th' town humorist has named him th' orange-peel hero, an'
he'll go to his grave with that name. Th' war is over an' th' state iv
war exists. If ye saw a man fall fr'm th' top iv a tin-story buildin'
'twud startle ye, wanst. If it happened again, 'twud surprise ye. But if
ye saw a man fall ivry fifteen minyits ye'd go home afther awhile f'r
supper an' ye wuddent even mintion it to ye'er wife."

"I don't know how manny heroes they ar-re in th' Philippeens. Down there
a man is ayether a sojer or a casualty. Bein' a casualty is no good. I
cud say about a man: 'He was a hero in th' war with Spain,' but how can
I say: 'Shake hands with Bill Grady, wan iv th' ladin' casualties iv our
late war?' 'Twud be no more thin to say he was wan iv th' gallant men
that voted f'r prisidint in 1896.'"


[Illustration]


"No, Hinnissy, people wants novelties in war. Th' war fashions iv 1898
is out iv style. They ar-re too full in th' waist an' too long in th'
skirt. Th' style has changed. There ar-re fifty thousand backward men in
th' fair isles iv th' Passyfic fightin' to free th' Philippeen fr'm
himsilf an' becomin' a casualty in th' operation, but no one is
charterin' ar-rmy hospital ships f'r thim."

"No one is convartin' anny steam yachts f'r thim. No wan is sindin'
eighty tons iv plum puddin' to complete th' wurruk iv destruction.
They ar-re in a war that'd make th' British throops in Africa think
they were drillin' f'r a prize banner. But'tis an onfashionable war.'
'Tis an ol' war made over fr'm garments formerly worn be heroes. Whin
a man is out in th' counthry with wan newspaper an' has read th'
authentic dispatches fr'm Ladysmith an' Harrismith an' Willumaldensmith
an' Mysteriousbillysmith an' the meetin' iv th' czar iv Rooshia with th'
Impror Willum an' th' fire in th' packin' house an' th' report iv th'
canal thrustees an' th' fightin' news an' th' want ads, an' afther he
has r-read thim over twinty times he looks at his watch an' says he,
'Holy smoke, 'tis two hours to thrain time an' I suppose I'll have to r-
read th' news fr'm th' Philippeens.' War, be hivins, is so common that I
believe if we was to take on a fight with all th' wurruld not more thin
half th' popylation iv New England'd die iv hear-rt disease befure they
got into th' cellars."

"Th' new style iv war is made in London an' all our set is simply stuck
on it. Th' casualties in th' Philippeens can walk home, but is it
possible that many thrue an' well-dhressed American can stand to see th'
signs iv th' ancient British aristocracy taken care iv be their own
gover'mint? 'What,' says Lady what's-her-name (her that was th' daughter
iv wan iv our bravest an' best racontoors). 'What.' she says, 'will anny
American woman residin' in London see men shot down,' she says, 'that
has but recently played polo in our very sight,' she says, 'an' be
brought home in mere thransports,' she says. 'Ladies,' she says, 'lave
us equip a hospital ship,' she says. 'I thrust,' she says, 'that all iv
us has been long enough fr'm home to f'rget our despicable domestic
struggles,' she says, 'an' think on'y iv humanity,' she says. An' whin
she opens up th' shop f'r subscriptions ye'd think fr'm th' crowd that
'twas th' first night iv th' horse show. I don't know what Lem Stiggins
iv Kansas, marked down in th' roll, Private in th' Twintieth Kansas,
Severely, I don't know what Private Severely thinks iv it. An' I wuddent
like to know till afther Thanks-givin'."

"Don't be blatherin'," said Mr. Hennessy. "Sure ye can't ixpict people
to be inthrested f'river in a first performance."

"No," said Mr. Dooley, "but whin th' audjeence gives th' comp'ny an
encore it ought at laste to pretind that it's not lavin' f'r th' other
show."




KENTUCKY POLITICS


"If th' Presidint doesn't step in an' interfere," said Mr. Hennessy,
"they'll be bloodshed in Kentucky."

"What business is it iv Mack's?" Mr. Dooley protested. "Th' war's in
this counthry, man alive! If 'twas in Boolgahria or Chiny or on th' head
waters iv th' Bozoon river in th' sooltynate iv--iv--I dinnaw what--
thin'twud be th' jooty iv our gover'mint f'r to resolve that th'
inthrests iv humanity an' civilization an' th' advancement iv th' human
kind required that we shud step in an' put a head on wan or both iv th'
parties. But they'se no reason now, me boy, f'r us to do annything, f'r
these are our own people, an' 'tis wan iv their rights, undher th'
martial law that's th' foundation iv our institutions, to bate each
other to death whiniver an' whereiver they plaze. 'Twud be all r-right
f'r the Impror Willum to come in an' take a hand, but Gawd help him if
he did, or th' Prsidint iv th' Fr-rinch or th' Impror iv Chiny. 'Twud be
all r-right f'r thim. An' though we might meet thim at th' dure an' hand
thim wan f'r their impydince, we'd be in th' wrong. Twud be a good job
f'r Aggynaldoo, too, if he cud find himsilf an' had th' time It must be
clear to him be what news he hears whin th' other pigrim father, Sinitor
Hoar, calls on him in th' three where he makes his home, that what
Kentucky needs now is wan an' on'y wan stable govermint an' a little
public peace. He might restore peace at home an' abroad be cuttin' in,
but th' poor la-ad has other things to think iv. I'd like to see him. It
must be near a year since he had a shave or a hair cut, barrin' ridges
made be bullets as he cleared th' fences."

"It looks to me as though th' raypublican is wr-rong," said Mr.
Hennessy, with the judicial manner of a man without prejudices.

"Iv coorse he's wrong," said Mr. Dooley. "He starts wrong. An' th'
dimmycrats ar-re r-right. They're always r-right. Tis their position.
Th' dimmycrats ar-re right an' the raypublicans has th' jobs. It all
come up because our vinerated party, Hinnissy, ain't quick at th' count.
Man an' boy I've taken an intherest in politics all me life, an' I find
th' on'y way to win an iliction is to begin f'r to count th' minyit
ye've completed th' preliminaries iv closin' th' polls an' killin' th'
other judges an' clerks.

"Th' dimmycrats counted, but th' count come too late. Be th' time th'
apparent an' hidjous majority iv th' raypublicans was rayjooced to
nawthin' an' a good liberal, substantial, legal an' riotous dimmycratic
majority put in its place be ordher iv th' coorts, th' commonwealth iv
Kentucky an' Jack Chinn, th' raypublican has been so long in th'job an'
has become so wedded to it that ye cuddent shake him out with a can iv
joynt powdher. It seems to him that there niver was a time whin he
wasn't gov'nor."

[Illustration]

"Th' dimmycrats get together an' call on that learned an' incorruptible
joodishary that's done so much to ilivate the party into high office,
an' whin th' dure iv th' saloon is locked they say 'Bill,' they say,
'we're bein' robbed iv our suffrage,' says they. 'Th' hated enimy has
stolen th' ballot an' thrampled on th' r-rights iv th' citizens,' says
they, 'in the southern part iv th' state faster thin we cud undo their
hellish wurruk in our own counties,' they says. 'They now hol' th'
jobs,' they say, 'an' if they stay in they'se no more chanst iv iver
ilictin' a dimmycrat again thin there wud be iv ilictin' a raypublican
if we got in,' they say. 'Do ye mix us up a replevy writ an' we'll go
over an' haul th' chair fr'm undher thim,' they say."

"So th' judge passes out a replevy writ be vartue iv th' thrust that's
been reposed in him be th' comity and gives it to Colonel Jack Chinn,
wan iv th' leaders iv th' Kentucky bar, f'r to serve. An' Colonel Jack
Chinn ar-rms himsilf as becomes a riprisintative iv a gr-reat coort
goin' to sarve a sacred writ iv replevy on th' usurper to th' loftiest
or wan iv th' loftiest jobs that th' people iv a gloryous state can
donate to a citizen. He sthraps on three gatlin' guns, four revolvers,
two swords, a rifle, a shot gun, a baseball bat, a hand grenade (to be
used on'y in case iv thirst), a pair iv handcuffs, brass knuckles, a
sandbag, a piece of lead pipe in a stockin', a rabbit's foot f'r luck, a
stove lid an' a can iv dinnymite, an' with siveral iv his cillybrated
knives behind his ears, in his hair, between his teeth, an' gleamin'
fr'm his pockets, he sallies forth on his sacred mission, an' gives th'
writ to a clerk to sarve, an' stays in town himsilf, where he
successfully resists all charges iv th' bartinder. Th' clerk goes up to
th' state house, where th' gov'nor is ixicutin' th' high thrust reposed
in him be himsilf, behind breastworks an' guarded be some iv th' most
desp'rate an' pathriotic ruffyans in th' state. 'What have ye there?'
says his ixcillincy, with his hand on th' sthring iv a dinnymite gun. 'A
writ fr'm th' coort bouncin' ye fr'm ye'er high office,' says th' clerk.
'As a law abidin' citizen,' says his ixcillincy, 'an' an official
enthrusted be th' people iv this glad state with th' exicution iv th'
statutes I bow to th' law,' he says. 'But,' he says, 'I'll be hanged if
I'll bow to th' decree iv anny low browed pussillanimous dimmycratic
coort,' he says, 'Sojers,' he says, 'seize this disturber iv th' peace
an' stick him in th' cellar. Jawn,' he says, 'ar-rm ye'ersilf an'
proceed to th' raypublican timple iv justice in Hogan's saloon an' have
th' stanch an' upright Judge Blood prepare some good honest writs iv th'
party iv Lincoln an' Grant,' he says. 'In th' manetime, as th'
constitootion has lost its sights an' the cylinder don't revolve,' he
says, 'I suspind it an' proclaim martial law,' he says. 'I want a law,'
he says, 'that mesilf an' all other good citizens can rayspict,' he
says. 'I want wan,' he says, 'that's been made undher me own personal
supervision,' he says. 'Hand-made, copper distilled, wan hun-dherd an'
tin proof martial law ought to be good enough for anny Kentuckyan,' he
says. So th' next ye hear th' sojers ar-re chasin' th' coorts out iv th'
state, th' legislature is meetin' in Duluth, Pinsacola, an' Bangor,
Maine, an' a comity iv citizens consistin' iv some iv the best gun
fighters iv th' state ar-re meetin' to decide how th' conthroversay can
be decided without loss iv blood or jobs. While they're in session th'
gov'nor is in contimpt iv coort, the coorts ar-re in contimpt iv th'
gov'nor, an' if annybody but Tiddy Rosenfclt has anny other feelin' f'r
ayether iv thim I haven't heerd him speak."

"They ought to fire out the raypublican," said Mr. Hennessy. "Sure 'tis
comin' to a nice state iv affairs whin th' likes iv him can defy the
coorts."

"Thrue f'r ye," said Mr. Dooley. "But I don't like th' looks iv it fr'm
our side iv th' house. Whiniver a dimmycrat has to go to coort to win an
iliction I get suspicious. They'se something wr-rong in Kentucky,
Hinnissy. We were too slow. Th' inimy got th' first cheat."




YOUNG ORATORY


"They'se wan thing that this counthry ought to be thankful f'r," said
Mr. Dooley, laying down his paper, "an' that is that we still have a lot
iv young an' growin' orators f'r to lead us on."

"Who's been oratin' now?" Mr. Hennessy asked.

"Me young frind Sinitor Beveridge, th' child orator iv Fall Creek. This
engagin' an' hopeful la-ad first made an impression with his eloquince
at th' age iv wan whin he addhressed a meetin' iv th' Tippecanoe club on
th' issues iv th' day. At th' age iv eight he was illicted to th' United
States Sinit, rayjoocin' th' average age iv that body to ninety-three
years. In th' sinit, bein' a modest child, he rayfused to speak f'r five
minyits, but was fin'lly injooced f'r to make a few thousan' remarks on
wan iv th' subjects now much discussed by orators whin th' dures ar-re
closed an' th' fire escapes broken."

"His subject was th' Ph'lippeens, an' he said he'd just come fr'm there.
'I have cruised,' he says, 'f 'r two thousan' miles through th' Ar-rchey
Pelago--that's a funny name--ivry minyit a surprise an' delight to those
that see me,' he says. 'I see corn growin' on banana threes; I see th'
gloryous heights iv Ding Dong that ar-re irradyatin'. civilization like
quills upon th' fretful porcypine,' he says. 'I see rice, coffee, rolls,
cocoanuts, choice seegars, oats, hay, hard and soft coal, an' Gen'ral
Otis--an' there's a man that I rayspict,' he says. 'I see flowers
bloomin' that was superyor to anny conservatory in Poolasky county,' he
says. 'I see th' low and vicious inhabitants iv th' counthry soon, I
thrust, to be me fellow-citizens, an' as I set there an' watched th' sea
rollin' up its uncounted millyons iv feet iv blue wather, an' th' stars
sparklin' like lamp-posts we pass in th' night, as I see th' mountains
raisin' their snow-capped heads f'r to salute th' sun, while their feet
extinded almost to th' place where I shtud; whin I see all th' glories
iv that almost, I may say, thropical clime, an' thought what a good
place this wud be f'r to ship base-burnin' parlor stoves, an' men's
shirtings to th' accursed natives iv neighborin' Chiny, I says to
mesilf, 'This is no mere man's wurruk. A Higher Power even than Mack,
much as I rayspict him, is in this here job. We cannot pause, we cannot
hesitate, we cannot delay, we cannot even stop! We must, in other
wurruds, go on with a holy purpose in our hearts, th' flag over our
heads an' th' inspired wurruds iv A. Jeremiah Beveridge in our ears,' he
says. An' he set down."

"Well, sir,'twas a gr-reat speech. 'Twas a speech ye cud waltz to. Even
younger men thin Sinitor Beveridge had niver made grander orations. Th'
throuble is th' sinit is too common f'r such magnificent sintimints; its
too common and its too old. Th' young la-ad comes fr'm home, where's
he's paralyzed th' Lithry Society an' th' Debatin' Club, an' he loads
himsilf up with a speech an' he says to himsilf: 'Whin I begin peggin'
ar-round a few iv these vilets I'll make Ol' Hoar look like confederate
money,' an' th' pa-apers tell that th' Infant Demostheens iv Barry's
Junction is about f'r to revive th oratorical thraditions iv th' sinit
an' th' fire department comes up f'r a week, an' wets down th' capitol
buildin'. Th' speech comes off, they ain't a dhry eye in th' House, an'
th' pa-apers say: 'Where's ye'er Dan'l Webster an' ye'er Champ Clark,
now?' An' th' young man goes away an' has his pitchers took on a
kinetoscope. He has a nice time while it lasts, Hinnissy, but it don't
las' long. It don't las' long. Th' la-ad has th' wind, but it's
endurance that counts."

"Th' wise ol' boys with their long whiskers discusses him over th'
sivin-up game, an' says wan iv thim: 'What ye think iv th' kid's
speech?' ''Twas a good speech,' says th' other. 'It carries me back to
me own boyhood days. I made a speech just like that durin' th' Mexican
War. Oh, thim days, thim days! I lead th' ace, Mike.' An' afther awhile
th' Boy Demostheens larns that while he's polishin' off his ipigrams,
an' ol' guy, that spinds all his time sleepin' on a bench, is polishin'
him off. Th' man that sinds seeds to his constitooents lasts longer thin
th' wan that sinds thim flowers iv iloquence, an' though th' hand iv
Gawd may be in th' Ph'lippeen question, it hasn't interfered up to date
in th' sergeant-at-arms question. An' whin th' young man sees this he
says, 'sky,' whin he means 'sky' an' not 'th' jooled canopy iv hiven,'
an' he says, 'Ph'lippeens,' an' not 'th' gloryous isles iv th'
Passyfic,' an' bein' onto th' character iv his fellow-sinitors, he
mintions nobody higher in their prisence thin th' steward iv th'
capitol. An' he niver makes a speech but whin he wants to smoke, an'
thin he moves that th' sinit go into executive session. Thin he's a rale
sinitor. I've seen it manny's th' time--th' boy orator goin' into th'
sinit, an' comin' out a deef mute. I've seen a man that made speeches
that was set to music an' played be a silver cornet band in Ioway that
hadn't been in Congress f'r a month befure he wudden't speak above a
whisper or more thin an inch fr'm ye'er ear."

"Do ye think Hiven sint us to th' Ph'lippeens?" Mr. Hennessy asked.

"I don't know," said Mr. Dooley, "th' divvle take thim."




PUBLIC GRATITUDE


"This man Dewey--," began Mr. Dooley.

"I thought he was ye'er cousin George," Mr. Hennessy interrupted.

"I thought he was," said Mr. Dooley, "but on lookin' closer at his
features an' r-readin' what th' pa-apers says about him, I am convinced
that I was wrong. Oh, he may be a sicond cousin iv me Aunt Judy. I'll
not say he ain't. There was a poor lot, all iv them. But I have no close
rilitives in this counthry. 'Tis a way I have of savin' a little money.
I'm like th' good an' gr-rateful American people. Th' further ye stay
away fr'm thim th' more they like ye. Sicond-cousin-iv-me Aunt-Judy-
George made a mistake comin' home, or if he did come home he ought've
invistigated his welcome and see that it wasn't mined. A man cud stand
up all day an' lave Packy Mountjoy whale away at him, but th' affiction
iv th' American people is always aimed thrue an' is invaryably fatal."

"Th' la-ad Dougherty was in to-day, an' he exprissed th' feelin's iv
this grateful raypublic. He says, says he, 'This fellow Dewey ain't what
I thought he was,' he says. 'I thought he was a good, broad, lib'ral
man, an' it turns out he's a cheap skate,' he says. 'We made too much
fuss over him,' he says. 'To think,' he says, 'iv him takin' th' house
we give him an' tur-rnin' it over to his wife,' he says. ''Tis
scand'lous,' he says. 'How much did ye con-thribute?' says I. 'I didn't
give annything,' he says 'The collector didn't come around, an' I'm glad
now I hung on to me coin,' he says. 'Well,' says I, 'I apprechate ye'er
feelin's,' I says. 'Ye agree with th' other subscribers,' I says. 'But
I've med up me mind not to lave annywan talk to me about Dewey,' I says,
'unless,' I says, 'he subscribed th' maximum amount iv th'
subscription,' I says, 'thirty-eight cints,' I says. 'So I'll thank ye
to tip-toe out,' I says, 'befure I give ye a correct imitation iv Dewey
an' Mountjoy at th' battle of Manila,' I says. An' he wint away."

"Th' throuble with Dewey is he was so long away he lost his
undherstanding iv th' thrue feelin' iv th' American people. George r-
read th' newspapers, an' he says to himself: 'Be hivins, they think well
iv what I done. I guess I'll put a shirt in me thrunk an' go home, f'r
'tis hot out here, an' ivrybody'll be glad f'r to see me,' he says. An'
he come along, an' New York was r-ready f'r him. Th' business in
neckties had been poor that summer, an' they was necessity f'r pullin'
it together, an' they give George a welcome an' invited his admirers
fr'm th' counthry to come in an' buy something f'r th' little wans at
home. An' he r-rode up Fifth Avnoo between smilin' rows iv hotels an'
dhrug stores, an' tin-dollar boxes an' fifty-cint seats an' he says to
himsilf: 'Holy smoke, if Aggynaldoo cud on'y see me now.' An' he was
proud an' happy, an' he says: 'Raypublics ar-re not always ongrateful.'
An' they ain't. On'y whin they give ye much gratichood ye want to freeze
some iv it, or it won't keep."

"'Tis unsafe f'r anny man alive to receive th' kind wurruds that ought
to be said on'y iv th' dead. As long as George was a lithograph iv
himsilf in a saloon window he was all r-right. Whin people saw he cud
set in a city hall hack without flowers growin' in it an' they cud look
at him without smoked glasses they begin to weaken in their devotion.
'Twud've been th' same, almost, if he'd married a Presbyteeryan an'
hadn't deeded his house to his wife. 'Dewey don't look much like a
hero,' says wan man. 'I shud say not,' says another. 'He looks like
annybody else.' 'He ain't a hero,' says another. 'Why, annybody cud've
done what he did. I got an eight-year-old boy, an' if he cudden't take a
baseball club an' go in an' bate that Spanish fleet into junk in twinty
minyits I'd call him Alger an' thrade him off f'r a bicycle,' he says.
'I guess that's r-right. They say he was a purty tough man befure he
left Wash'n'ton.' 'Sure he was. Why, so-an'-so-an'-so-an'-so.' 'Ye don't
tell me!' 'Is there annything in that story about his beatin' his poor
ol' aunt an' her iliven childher out iv four dollars?' 'I guess that's
straight. Ye can tell be th' looks iv him he's a mean man. I niver see a
man with squintin' eyes an' white hair that wudden't rob a church!'
'He's a cow'rd, too. Why, he r-run away at th' battle iv Manila.
Ivrybody knows it. I r-read what Joe What's-His-Name wrote--th' br-rave
corryspondint. He says this feller was sick at his stummick an' retired
befure th' Spanish fire. Why, what'd he have to fight but a lot iv ol'
row-boats? A good swimmer with sharp teeth cud've bit his way through
th' whole Spanish fleet. An' he r-run away. I tell ye, it makes me tired
to think iv th' way we abused th' Spanyards not long ago. Why, say, they
done a lot betther thin this fellow Dewey, with his forty or fifty men-
iv-war an' this gran' nation, miles away, standin' shoulder to shoulder
at his back. They niver tur-rned over their property to their wives.'
'Yes,' says wan man, 'Dewey was a cow'rd. Let's go an' stone his house.'
'No,' says the crowd, 'he might come out. Let's go down to th' v'riety
show an' hiss his pitcher in th' kinetoscope.' Well!'"

"Well what?" demanded Mr. Hennessy.

"Well," Mr. Dooley continued, "I was on'y goin' to say, Hinnissy, that
in spite iv me hathred iv George as a man--a marrid man--an' me contimpt
f'r his qualities as a fighter, in spite iv th' chickens he has stole
an' the notes he has forged an' th' homes he has rooned, if he was to
come r-runnin' up Archey road, as he might, pursooed be ladies an'
gintlemen an' th' palajeem iv our liberties peltin him with rotten eggs
an' ol' cats, I'd open th' dure f'r him, an' whin he come in I'd put me
fut behind it an' I'd say to th' grateful people: 'Fellow-citizens,' I'd
say, 'lave us,' I'd say. 'They'se another hero down in Halstead Sthreet
that's been marrid. Go down an' shivaree him. An' you, me thrusted
collagues iv th' press, disperse to ye'er homes,' I'd say. 'Th' keyholes
is closed f'r th' night, I'd say. An' thin I'd bolt th' dure an' I'd
say, 'George, take off ye'er coat an' pull up to th' fire. Here's a
noggin' iv whisky near ye'er thumb an' a good seegar f'r ye to smoke.
I'm no hero-worshiper. I'm too old. But I know a man whin I see wan, an'
though we cudden't come out an' help ye whin th' subscription list wint
wild, be sure we think as much iv ye as we did whin ye'er name was first
mintioned be th' stanch an' faithful press. Set here, ol' la-ad, an'
warrum ye'er toes by th' fire. Set here an' r-rest fr'm th' gratichood
iv ye'er fellow-counthrymen, that, as Shakspere says, biteth like an asp
an' stingeth like an adder. R-rest here, as ye might r-rest at th'
hearth iv millyons iv people that cud give ye no house but their own!"

"I dinnaw about that," said Mr. Hennessy. "I like Dewey, but I think he
oughtn't to've give away th' gift iv th' nation."

"Well," said Mr. Dooley, "if 'twas a crime f'r an American citizen to
have his property in his wife's name they'd be close quarthers in th'
pinitinchry."




MARRIAGE AND POLITICS


"I see," said Mr. Hennessy, "that wan iv thim New York joods says a man
in pollytics oughtn't to be marrid."

"Oh, does he?" said Mr. Dooley.

"Well, 'tis little he knows about it. A man in pollytics has got to be
marrid. If he ain't marrid where'll he go f'r another kind iv throuble?
An' where'll he find people to support? An unmarrid man don't get along
in pollytics because he don't need th' money. Whin he's in th' middle iv
a prim'ry, with maybe twinty or thirty iv th' opposite party on top iv
him, thinks he to himsilf: 'What's th' good iv fightin' f'r a job?
They'se no wan depindant on me f'r support,' an' he surrinders. But a
marrid man says: 'What'll happen to me wife an' twelve small childher if
I don't win out here today?' an' he bites his way to th' top iv th' pile
an' breaks open th' ballot box f'r home and fireside. That's th' thruth
iv it, Hinnissy. Ye'll find all th' big jobs held be marrid men an' all
th' timpry clerkships be bachelors."

"Th' reason th' New York jood thinks marrid men oughtn't to be in
pollytics is because he thinks pollytics is spoort. An' so it is. But it
ain't amachoor spoort, Hinnissy. They don't give ye a pewter mug with
ye'er name on it f'r takin' a chanst on bein' kilt. 'Tis a profissional
spoort, like playin' base-ball f'r a livin' or wheelin' a thruck. Ye
niver see an amachoor at annything that was as good as a profissional.
Th' best amachoor ball team is beat be a bad profissional team; a
profissional boxer that thrains on bock beer an' Swiss cheese can lam
the head off a goold medal amachoor champeen that's been atin' moldy
bread an' dhrinkin' wather f'r six months, an' th' Dago that blows th'
cornet on th' sthreet f'r what annywan 'll throw him can cut the figure
eight around Dinnis Finn, that's been takin' lessons f'r twinty year.
No, sir, pollytics ain't dhroppin' into tea, an' it ain't wurrukin' a
scroll saw, or makin' a garden in a back yard. 'Tis gettin' up at six
o'clock in th' mornin' an' r-rushin' off to wurruk, an' comin' home at
night tired an' dusty. Double wages f'r overtime an' Sundahs."

"So a man's got to be marrid to do it well. He's got to have a wife at
home to make him oncomfortable if he comes in dhrunk, he's got to have
little prattlin' childher that he can't sind to th' Young Ladies'
academy onless he stuffs a ballotbox properly, an' he's got to have a
sthrong desire f'r to live in th' av'noo an' be seen dhrivin' downtown
in an open carredge with his wife settin' beside him undher a r-red
parasol. If he hasn't these things he won't succeed in pollytics--or
packin' pork. Ye niver see a big man in pollytics that dhrank hard, did
ye? Ye never will. An' that's because they're all marrid. Th'
timptation's sthrong, but fear is sthronger."

"Th' most domestic men in th' wurruld ar-re politicians, an' they always
marry early. An' that's th' sad part iv it, Hinnissy. A pollytician
always marries above his own station. That's wan sign that he'll be a
successful pollytician. Th' throuble is, th' good woman stays planted
just where she was, an' he goes by like a fast thrain by a whistlin'
station. D'ye mind O'Leary, him that's a retired capitalist now, him
that was aldherman, an' dhrainage thrustee, an' state sinitor f'r wan
term? Well, whin I first knew O'Leary he wurruked down on a railroad
section tampin' th' thrack at wan-fifty a day. He was a sthrong, willin'
young fellow, with a stiff right-hand punch an' a schamin' brain, an'
anny wan cud see that he was intinded to go to th' fr-ront. Th'
aristocracy iv th' camp was Mrs. Cassidy, th' widdy lady that kept th'
boordin'-house. Aristocracy, Hinnissy, is like rale estate, a matther iv
location. I'm aristocracy to th' poor O'Briens back in th' alley, th'
brewery agent's aristocracy to me, his boss is aristocracy to him, an'
so it goes, up to the czar of Rooshia. He's th' pick iv th' bunch, th'
high man iv all, th' Pope not goin' in society. Well, Mrs. Cassidy was
aristocracy to O'Leary. He niver see such a stylish woman as she was
whin she turned out iv a Sundah afthernoon in her horse an' buggy. He'd
think to himsilf, 'If I iver can win that I'm settled f'r life,' an' iv
coorse he did. 'Twas a gran' weddin'; manny iv th' guests didn't show up
at wurruk f'r weeks."

"O'Leary done well, an' she was a good wife to him. She made money an'
kept him sthraight an' started him for constable. He won out, bein' a
sthrong man. Thin she got him to r-run f'r aldher-man, an' ye shud've
seen her th' night he was inaugurated! Be hivins, Hinnissy, she looked
like a fire in a pawnshop, fair covered with dimons an' goold watches
an' chains. She was cut out to be an aldherman's wife, and it was worth
goin' miles to watch her leadin' th' gran' march at th' Ar-rchy Road
Dimmycratic Fife an' Dhrum Corps ball."

"But there she stopped. A good woman an' a kind wan, she cudden't go th'
distance. She had th' house an' th' childher to care f'r an' her eddy-
cation was through with. They isn't much a woman can learn afther she
begins to raise a fam'ly. But with O'Leary 'twas diffrent. I say 'twas
diff'rent with O'Leary. Ye talk about ye'er colleges, Hinnissy, but
pollytics is th' poor man's college. A la-ad without enough book larnin'
to r-read a meal-ticket, if ye give him tin years iv polly-tical life,
has th' air iv a statesman an' th' manner iv a jook, an' cud take anny
job fr'm dalin' faro bank to r-runnin th' threasury iv th' United
States. His business brings him up again' th' best men iv th' com-
munity, an' their customs an' ways iv speakin' an' thinkin' an robbin'
sticks to him. Th' good woman is at home all day. Th' on'y people she
sees is th' childher an' th' neighbors. While th' good man in a swallow-
tail coat is addhressin' th' Commercial club on what we shud do f'r to
reform pollytics, she's discussin' th' price iv groceries with th'
plumber's wife an' talkin' over th' back fince to the milkman. Thin
O'Leary moves up on th' boolyvard. He knows he'll get along all r-right
on th' boolyvard. Th' men'll say: 'They'se a good deal of rugged common
sinse in that O'Leary. He may be a robber, but they's mighty little that
escapes him.' But no wan speaks to Mrs. O'Leary. No wan asts her opinion
about our foreign policy. She sets day in an' day out behind th' dhrawn
curtains iv her three-story brownstone risidence prayin' that somewan'll
come in an' see her, an if annywan comes she's frozen with fear. An'
'tis on'y whin she slips out to Ar-rchey r-road an' finds th' plumber's
wife, an' sets in th' kitchen over a cup iv tay, that peace comes to
her. By an' by they offer O'Leary th' nommynation f'r congress. He knows
he's fit for it. He's sthronger thin th' young lawyer they have now.
People'll listen to him in Wash'nton as they do in Chicago. He says:
'I'll take it.' An' thin he thinks iv th' wife an' they's no Wash'nton
f'r him. His pollytical career is over. He wud niver have been constable
if he hadn't marrid, but he might have been sinitor if he was a
widower."

"Mrs. O'Leary was in to see th' Dargans th' other day. 'Ye mus' be very
happy in ye'er gran' house, with Mr. O'Leary doin' so well,' says Mrs.
Dargan. An' th' on'y answer th' foolish woman give was to break down an'
weep on Mrs. Dargan's neck."

"Yet ye say a pollytician oughtn't to get marrid," said Mr. Hennessy.

"Up to a certain point," said Mr. Dooley, "he must be marrid. Afther
that--well, I on'y say that, though pollytics is a gran' career f'r a
man, 'tis a tough wan f'r his wife."




ALCOHOL AS FOOD


"If a man come into this saloon--" Mr. Hennessy was saying.

"This ain't no saloon," Mr. Dooley interrupted. "This is a resthrant."

"A what?" Mr. Hennessy exclaimed.

"A resthrant," said Mr. Dooley. "Ye don't know, Hinnissy, that liquor is
food. It is though. Food--an' dhrink. That's what a doctor says in the
pa-apers, an' another doctor wants th' gover'mint to sind tubs iv th'
stuff down to th' Ph'lipeens. He says 'tis almost issintial that people
shud dhrink in thim hot climates. Th' prespiration don't dhry on thim
afther a hard pursoot iv Aggynaldoo an' th' capture iv Gin'ral
Pantaloons de Garshy; they begin to think iv home an' mother sindin'
down th' lawn-sprinkler to be filled with bock, an' they go off
somewhere, an' not bein' able to dhry thimsilves with dhrink, they want
to die. Th' disease is called nostalgia or home-sickness, or thirst."

"'What we want to do f'r our sojer boys in th' Ph'lipeens besides
killin' thim,' says th' ar-rmy surgeon, 'is make th' place more
homelike,' he says. 'Manny iv our heroes hasn't had th' deleeryum
thremens since we first planted th' stars an' sthripes,' he says, 'an'
th' bay'nits among th' people,' he says. 'I wud be in favor iv havin'
th' rigimints get their feet round wanst a week, at laste,' he says.
'Lave us,' he says, 'reform th' reg'lations,' he says, 'an' insthruct
our sojers to keep their powdher dhry an' their whistles wet,' he says."

"Th' idee ought to take, Hinnissy, f'r th' other doctor la-ad has
discovered that liquor is food. 'A man,' says he, 'can live f'r months
on a little booze taken fr'm time to time,' he says 'They'se a gr-reat
dale iv nourishment in it,' he says. An' I believe him, f'r manny's th'
man I know that don't think iv eatin' whin he can get a dhrink. I
wondher if the time will iver come whin ye'll see a man sneakin' out iv
th' fam'ly enthrance iv a lunch-room hurridly bitin' a clove! People may
get so they'll carry a light dinner iv a pint iv rye down to their
wurruk, an' a man'll tell ye he niver takes more thin a bottle iv beer
f'r breakfast. Th' cook'll give way to th' bartinder and th' doctor 'll
ordher people f'r to ate on'y at meals. Ye'll r-read in th' pa-apers
that 'Anton Boozinski, while crazed with ham an' eggs thried to kill his
wife an' childher.' On Pathrick's day ye'll see th' Dr. Tanner Anti-Food
Fife an' Drum corpse out at th' head iv th' procession instead iv th'
Father Macchews, an' they'll be places where a man can be took whin he
gets th' monkeys fr'm immodhrate eatin'. Th' sojers 'll complain that
th' liquor was unfit to dhrink an' they'll be inquiries to find out who
sold embammin' flood to th' ar-rmy--Poor people 'll have simple meals--
p'raps a bucket iv beer an' a little crame de mint, an' ye'll r-read in
th' pa-apers about a family found starvin' on th' North side, with
nawthin' to sustain life but wan small bottle iv gin, while th' head iv
th' family, a man well known to the polis, spinds his wages in a low
doggery or bakeshop fuddlin' his brains with custars pie. Th' r-rich 'll
inthrajoose novelties. P'raps they'll top off a fine dinner with a
little hasheesh or proosic acid. Th' time'll come whin ye'll see me in a
white cap fryin' a cocktail over a cooksthove, while a nigger hollers to
me: 'Dhraw a stack iv Scotch,' an' I holler back: 'On th' fire.' Ye will
not."

"That's what I thought," said Mr. Hennessy.

"No," said Mr. Dooley. "Whisky wudden't be so much iv a luxury if'twas
more iv a necissity. I don't believe 'tis a food, though whin me frind
Schwartzmeister makes a cocktail all it needs is a few noodles to look
like a biled dinner. No, whisky ain't food. I think betther iv it thin
that. I wudden't insult it be placin' it on th' same low plane as a
lobster salad. Father Kelly puts it r-right, and years go by without him
lookin' on it even at Hallowe'en. 'Whisky,' says he, 'is called the
divvle, because,' he says, ''tis wan iv the fallen angels,' he says. 'It
has its place,' he says, 'but its place is not in a man's head,' says
he. 'It ought to be th' reward iv action, not th' cause iv it,' he says.
'It's f'r th' end iv th' day, not th' beginnin',' he says. 'Hot whisky
is good f'r a cold heart, an' no whisky's good f'r a hot head,' he says.
'Th' minyit a man relies on it f'r a crutch he loses th' use iv his
legs. 'Tis a bad thing to stand on, a good thing to sleep on, a good
thing to talk on, a bad thing to think on. If it's in th' head in th'
mornin' it ought not to be in th' mouth at night. If it laughs in ye,
dhrink; if it weeps, swear off. It makes some men talk like good women,
an' some women talk like bad men. It is a livin' f'r orators an' th'
death iv bookkeepers. It doesn't sustain life, but, whin taken hot with
wather, a lump iv sugar, a piece iv lemon peel, and just th' dustin' iv
a nutmeg-grater, it makes life sustainable."

"D'ye think ye-ersilf it sustains life"? asked Mr. Hennessy.

"It has sustained mine f'r many years," said Mr. Dooley.




HIGH FINANCE


"I think," said Mr. Dooley, "I'll go down to th' stock yards an' buy a
dhrove iv Steel an' Wire stock."

"Where wud ye keep it?" asked the unsuspecting Hennessy.

"I'll put it out on th' vacant lot," said Mr. Dooley, "an' lave it grow
fat by atin' ol' bur-rd cages an' tin cans. I'll milk it hard, an' whin
'tis dhry I'll dispose iv it to th' widdies an' orphans iv th' Sixth
Ward that need household pets. Be hivins, if they give me half a chanst,
I'll be as gr-reat a fi-nanceer as anny man in Wall sthreet.

"Th' reason I'm so confident iv th' value iv Steel an' Wire stock,
Hinnissy, is they're goin' to hur-rl th' chairman iv th' comity into
jail. That's what th' pa-apers calls a ray iv hope in th' clouds iv
dipression that've covered th' market so long. 'Tis always a bull
argymint. 'Snowplows common was up two pints this mornin' on th' rumor
that th' prisidint was undher ar-rest.' 'They was a gr-reat bulge in
Lobster preferred caused be th' report that instead iv declarin' a
dividend iv three hundhred per cint. th' comp'ny was preparin' to
imprison th' boord iv directors.' 'We sthrongly ricommind th' purchase
iv Con and Founder. This comp'ny is in ixcillint condition since th'
hangin' iv th' comity on reorganization.'"

"What's th' la-ad been doin', Hinnissy? He's been lettin' his frinds in
on th' groun' flure--an' dhroppin' thim into th' cellar. Ye know
Cassidy, over in th' Fifth, him that was in th' ligislachure? Well, sir,
he was a gr-reat frind iv this man. They met down in Springfield whin
th' la-ad had something he wanted to get through that wud protect th'
widdies an' orphans iv th' counthry again their own avarice, an' he
must've handed Cassidy a good argymint, f'r Cassidy voted f'r th' bill,
though threatened with lynchin' be stockholders iv th' rival comp'ny. He
come back here so covered with dimons that wan night whin he was
standin' on th' rollin' mill dock, th' captain iv th' Eliza Brown
mistook his shirt front f'r th' bridge lights an' steered into a soap
facthry on th' lee or gas-house shore."

"Th' man made a sthrong impression on Cassidy. 'Twas: 'As me frind Jawn
says,' or 'I'll ask Jawn about that,' or 'I'm goin' downtown to-day to
find out what Jawn advises.' He used to play a dollar on th' horses or
sivin-up f'r th' dhrinks, but afther he met Jawn he wanted me to put in
a ticker, an' he wud set in here figurin' with a piece iv chalk on how
high Wire'd go if hoopskirts come into fashion again. 'Give me a dhrop
iv whisky,' he says, 'f'r I'm inthrested in Distillers,' he says, 'an'
I'd like to give it a shove,' he says. 'How's Gas?' he says. 'A little
weak, to-day,'" says I.

"Twill be sthronger,' he says. 'If it ain't,' says I, 'I'll take out th'
meter an' connect th' pipe with th' ventilator. I might as well bur-rn
th' wind free as buy it,'" I says.

"A couple iv weeks ago he see Jawn an' they had a long talk about it.
'Cassidy,' says Jawn, 'ye've been a good frind iv mine,' he says, 'an'
I'd do annything in the wurruld f'r ye, no matther what it cost ye,' he
says. 'If ye need a little money to tide over th' har-rd times till th'
ligislachure meets again buy'--an' he whispered in Cassidy's ear. 'But,'
he says,'don't tell annywan. 'Tis a good thing, but I want to keep it
bottled up,'" he says.

"Thin Jawn took th' thrain an' begun confidin' his secret to a few
select frinds. He give it to th' conductor on th' thrain, an' th'
porther, an' th' candy butcher; he handed it to a switchman that got on
th' platform at South Bend, an' he stopped off at Detroit long enough to
tell about it to the deepo' policeman. He had a sign painted with th'
tip on it an' hung it out th' window, an' he found a man that carrid a
thrombone in a band goin' over to Buffalo, an' he had him set th' good
thing to music an' play it through th' thrain. Whin he got to New York
he stopped at the Waldorf Asthoria, an' while th' barber was powdhrin'
his face with groun' dimons Jawn tol' him to take th' money he was goin'
to buy a policy ticket with an' get in on th' good thing. He tol' th'
bootblack, th' waiter, th' man at th' news-stand, th' clerk behind th'
desk, an' th' bartinder in his humble abode. He got up a stereopticon
show with pitchers iv a widow-an-orphan befure an' afther wirin', an' he
put an advertisement in all th' pa-apers tellin' how his stock wud make
weak men sthrong. He had th' tip sarved hot in all th' resthrants in
Wall sthrcet, an' told it confidintially to an open-air meetin' in
Madison Square. 'They'se nawthin,' he says, 'that does a tip so much
good as to give it circulation,' he says. 'I think, be this time,' he
says, 'all me frinds knows how to proceed, but--Great Hivins!' he says.
'What have I done? Whin all the poor people go to get th' stock they
won't be anny f'r thim. I can not lave thim thus in th' lurch. Me
reputation as a gintleman an' a fi-nanceer is at stake,' he says.
'Rather than see these brave people starvin' at th' dure f'r a morsel iv
common or preferred, I'll--I'll sell thim me own stock,' he says. An' he
done it. He done it, Hinnissy, with unfalthrin' courage an' a clear eye.
He sold thim his stock, an' so's they might get what was left at a
raysonable price, he wrote a confidintial note to th' pa-apers tellin'
thim th' stock wasn't worth thirty cints a cord, an' now, be hivins,
they're talkin' iv puttin' him in a common jail or pinitinchry
preferred. Th' ingratichood iv man."

"But what about Cassidy?" Mr. Hennessy asked.

"Oh," said Mr. Dooley, "he was in here las' night. 'How's our old frind
Jawn?' says I. He said nawthin'. 'Have ye seen ye'er collidge chum iv
late?' says I. 'Don't mintion that ma-an's name,' says he. 'To think iv
what I've done f'r him,' he says, 'an' him to throw me down,' he says.
'Did ye play th' tip?' says I. 'I did,' says he. 'How did ye come out?'
says I. 'I haven't a cint lift but me renommynation f'r th'
ligislachure,' says he. 'Well,' says I, 'Cassidy,' I says, 'ye've been
up again what th' pa-apers call hawt finance,' I says. 'What th'
divvle's that?' says he. 'Well,' says I, 'it ain't burglary, an' it
ain't obtainin' money be false pretinses, an' it ain't manslaughter,' I
says. 'It's what ye might call a judicious seliction fr'm th' best
features iv thim ar-rts,' I says. 'T'was too sthrong f'r me,' he says.
'It was,' says I. 'Ye're about up to simple thransom climbin', Cassidy,'
I says."




THE PARIS EXPOSITION


"If this r-rush iv people to th' Paris exposition keeps up," said Mr.
Hennessy, "they won't be enough left here f'r to ilict a prisidint."

"They'll be enough left," said Mr. Dooley. "There always is. No wan has
gone fr'm Arrchey r-road, where th' voters ar-re made. I've looked ar-
round ivry mornin' expectin' to miss some familyar faces. I thought
Dorgan, th' plumber, wud go sure, but he give it up at th' las' moment,
an' will spind his summer on th' dhrainage canal. Th' baseball season
'll keep a good manny others back, an' a number iv riprisintative
cit'zens who have stock or jobs in th' wire mills have decided that 'tis
much betther to inthrust their savin's to John W. Gates thin to blow
thim in again th' sthreets iv Cairo."

"But takin' it by an' large 'twill be a hard winter f'r th' r-rich.
Manny iv thim will have money enough f'r to return, but they'll be much
sufferin' among thim. I ixpict to have people dhroppin' in here nex'
fall with subscription books f'r th' survivors iv th' Paris exhibition.
Th' women down be th' rollin' mills 'll be sewin' flannels f'r th'
disthressed millyonaires, an' whin th' childher kick about th' food
ye'll say, Hinnissy, 'Just think iv th' poor wretches in th' Lake Shore
dhrive an' thank Gawd f'r what ye have.' Th' mayor 'll open soup
kitchens where th' unforchnit people can come an' get a hearty meal an'
watch th' ticker, an' whin th' season grows hard, ye'll see pinched an'
hungry plutocrats thrampin' th' sthreets with signs r-readin': 'Give us
a cold bottle or we perish.' Perhaps th' polis 'll charge thim an' bust
in their stovepipe hats, th' prisidint 'll sind th' ar-rmy here, a
conspiracy 'll be discovered at th' club to blow up th' poorhouse, an'
volunteers 'll be called on fr'm th' nickel bed houses to protect th'
vested inthrests iv established poverty."

"'Twill be a chanst f'r us to get even, Hinnissy. I'm goin' to organize
th' Return Visitin' Nurses' association, composed entirely iv victims iv
th' parent plant. 'Twill be worth lookin' at to see th' ladies fr'm th'
stock yards r-rushin' into some wretched home down in Peerary avenue,
grabbin' th' misthress iv th' house be th' shouldhers an' makin' her
change her onhealthy silk dhress f'r a pink wrapper, shovelin' in a
little ashes to sprinkle on th' flure, breakin' th' furniture an'
rollin' th' baby in th' coal box. What th' r-rich needs is intilligint
attintion. 'Don't ate that oatmeal. Fry a nice piece iv r-round steak
with onions, give th' baby th' bone to play with, an' sind Lucille
Ernestine acrost th' railroad thrack f'r a nickel's worth iv beer. Thin
ye'll be happy, me good woman.' Oh, 'twill be gran'. I won't give
annything to people that come to th' dure. More har-m is done be
indiscriminate charity than anny wan knows, Hinnissy. Half th' bankers
that'll come to ye-er kitchen nex' winter cud find plenty iv wurruk to
do if they really wanted it. Dhrink an' idleness is th' curse iv th'
class. If they come to me I'll sind thim to th' Paris Survivors'
Mechanical Relief Association, an' they can go down an' set on a cake iv
ice an' wait till th' man in charge finds thim a job managin' a diamond
mine."

[Illustration]

Mr. Hennessy dismissed Mr. Dooley's fancy sketch with a grin and
remarked: "These here expositions is a gran' thing f'r th' progress iv
th' wurruld."

"Ye r-read that in th' pa-apers," said Mr. Dooley, "an" it isn't so. Put
it down fr'm me, Hinnissy, that all expositions is a blind f'r th'
hootchy-kootchy dance. They'll be some gr-reat exhibits at th' Paris
fair. Th' man that has a machine that'll tur-rn out three hundhred
thousan' toothpicks ivry minyit'll sind over his inthrestin' device,
they'll be mountains iv infant food an' canned prunes, an' pickle
casters, an' pants, an' boots, an' shoes an' paintin's. They'll be all
th' wondhers iv modhern science. Ye can see how shirts ar-re made, an'
what gives life to th' sody fountain. Th' man that makes th' glue that
binds 'll be wearin' more medals thin an officer iv th' English ar-rmy
or a cinchry bicycle rider, an' years afther whin ye see a box iv soap
ye'll think iv th' manufacthrer standin' up befure a hundhred thousan'
frinzied Fr-rinchmen in th' Boss du Boloney while th' prisidint iv th'
Fr-rinch places a goold wreath on his fair brow an' says: 'In th' name
iv th' ar-rts an' science, undher th' motto iv our people, "Libertinity,
insanity, an' frugality," I crown ye th' champeen soapmaker iv th'
wurruld. [Cheers.] Be ye'er magnificint invintion ye have dhrawn closer
th' ties between Paris an' Goshen, Indyanny [frantic applause], which I
hope will niver be washed away. I wish ye much success as ye climb th'
lather iv fame.' Th' invintor is thin dhrawn ar-roun' th' sthreets iv
Paris in a chariot pulled be eight white horses amid cries iv 'Veev
Higgins,' 'Abase Castile,' et cethra, fr'm th' populace. An' manny a
heart beats proud in Goshen that night. That's th' way ye think iv it,
but it happens diff'rent, Hinnissy. Th' soap king, th' prune king, an'
th' porous plaster king fr'm here won't stir up anny tumult in Paris
this year. Th' chances ar-re th' prisidint won't know they're there, an'
no wan'll speak to thim but a cab dhriver, an' he'll say: 'Th' fare fr'm
th' Changs All Easy to th' Roo de Roo is eighteen thousan' francs, but
I'll take ye there f'r what ye have in ye-er pockets.'"

"The millyonaire that goes over there to see th' piled up riches iv th'
wurruld in sausage-makin' 'll take a look ar-round him an' he'll say to
th' first polisman he meets: 'Gossoon, this is a fine show an' I know
yon palace is full to th' seams with chiny-ware an' washtubs, but wud ye
be so kind, mong brav', as to p'int out with ye-er club th' partic'lar
house where th' houris fr'm th' sultan's harem dances so well without
the aid iv th' human feet?' I know how it was whin we had th' fair here.
I had th' best intintions in th' wurruld to find out what I ought to
have larned fr'm me frind Armour, how with th' aid iv Gawdgiven
machinery ye can make a bedstead, a pianola, a dozen whisk-brooms, a
barrel iv sour mash whisky, a suit iv clothes, a lamp chimbly, a wig, a
can iv gunpowdher, a bah'rl iv nails, a prisidintial platform, an' a
bur-rdcage out iv what remains iv th' cow-I was detarmined to probe into
th' wondhers iv science, an' I started fair f'r th' machinery hall.
Where did I bring up, says ye? In th' fr-ront seat iv a playhouse with
me eye glued on a lady iv th' sultan's coort, near Brooklyn bridge,
thryin' to twisht out iv hersilf."

"No, Hinnissy, they'll be manny things larned be Americans that goes to
Paris, but they won't be about th' 'convarsion iv boots into food, or
vicey varsa,' as Hogan says. An' that's r-right. If I wint over there
'tis little time I'd be spindin' thryin' to discover how th' wondhers iv
mechanical janius are projooced that makes livin' so much more healthy
an' oncomfortable. But whin I got to Paris I'd hire me a hack or a dhray
painted r-red, an' I'd put me feet out th' sides an' I'd say to th'
dhriver: 'Rivolutionist, pint ye-er horse's head to'rds th'home iv th'
skirt dance, hit him smartly, an' go to sleep. I will see th' snow-plow
show an' th' dentisthry wurruk in th' pa-apers. F'r th' prisint I'll
devote me attintion to makin' a noise in th' sthreets an' studyin' human
nature.'"

"Ye'd be a lively ol' buck over there," said Mr. Hennessy, admiringly.
'"Tis a good thing ye can't go."

"It is so," said Mr. Dooley. "I'm glad I have no millyonaire rilitives
to be depindent on me f'r support whin th' show's over."




CHRISTIAN JOURNALISM


"I see," said Mr. Dooley, "that th' la-ad out in Kansas that thried to
r-run a paper like what th' Lord wud r-run if he had lived in Topeka,
has thrun up th' job."

"Sure, I niver heerd iv him," said Mr. Hennessy.

"Well, 'twus this way with him," Mr. Dooley explained. "Ye see, he
didn't like th' looks iv th' newspapers. He got tired iv r-readin' how
many rows iv plaits Mrs. Potther Pammer had on th' las' dhress she
bought, an' whether McGovern oughtn't to go into th' heavy-weight class
an' fight Jeffries, an' he says, says th' la-ad, 'This is no right
readin' f'r th' pure an' passionless youth iv Kansas,' he says. 'Give
me,' he says, 'a chanst an' I'll projooce th' kind iv organ that'd be
got out in hiven,' he says, 'price five cints a copy,' he says, 'f'r
sale be all newsdealers; f'r advertisin' rates consult th' cashier,' he
says. So a man in Topeka that had a newspaper, he says: 'I will not be
behindhand,' he says, 'in histin' Kansas up fr'm its prisint low an'
irrellijous position,' he says. 'I don't know how th' inhabitants iv
th' place ye refer to is fixed,' he says, 'f'r newspapers,' he says,
'an' I niver heerd iv annybody fr'm Kansas home-stakin' there,' he says,
'but if ye'll attind to th' circulation iv thim parts,' he says, 'I'll
see that th' paper is properly placed in th' hands iv th' vile an'
wicked iv this earth, where,' he says, 'th' returns ar-re more quick,'
he says."

"Well, th' la-ad wint at it, an' 'twas a fine paper he made. Hogan was
in here th' other day with a copy iv it an' I r-read it. I haven't had
such a lithry threat since I was a watchman on th' canal f'r a week with
nawthin' to r-read but th' delinquent tax list an' the upper half iv a
weather map. 'Twas gran'. Th' editor, it seems, Hinnissy, wint into th'
editoryal rooms iv th' pa-aper an' he gathered th' force around him fr'm
their reg'lar jobs in th' dhrug stores, an' says he, 'Gintlemen,' he
says, 'tell me ye'er plans f'r to enoble this here Christyan publication
f'r to-day!' he says. 'Well,' says th' horse rayporther, 'they's a
couple iv rabbits goin' to sprint around th' thrack at th' fair
groun's,' he says. I think 'twud be a good thing f'r rellijon if ye'd
lind me tin that I might br-reak th' sin-thralled bookys that come down
here fr'm Kansas City f'r to skin th' righteous,' he says. 'No,' says
th' editor, he says, 'no horse racin' in this paper,' he says. ''Tis th'
roonation iv th' young, an' ye can't beat it,' he says. 'An' you, fair-
haired youth,' he says, 'what d'ye do that makes ye'er color so good an'
ye'er eye so bright?' 'I,' says th' la-ad, 'am th' boy that writes th'
fightin' dope,' he says. 'They'se a couple iv good wans on at th' op'ra
house to-night, an' if his Spiklets don't tin-can 'tis like findin'
money in an ol' coat that--' 'Fightin',' says th' editor, 'is a crool
an' onchristyan spoort,' he says. 'Instead iv chroniclin' th' ruffyanism
iv these misguided wretches that weigh in at th' ringside at 125 poun's,
an' I see in a pa-aper I r-read in a barber shop th' other day that
Spike's gone away back--what's that I'm sayin'? Niver mind. D'ye go down
to th' home iv th' Rivrind Aloysius Augustus Morninbinch an'interview
him on th' question iv man's co-operation with grace in conversion. Make
a nice chatty article about it an' I'll give ye a copy iv wan iv me
books.' 'I will,' says th' la-ad, 'if he don't swing on me,' he says.
The editor thin addhressed th' staff. 'Gintlemen,' he says, 'I find that
th' wurruk ye've been accustomed to doin',' he says, 'is calc'lated f'r
to disthroy th' morality an' debase th' home life iv Topeka, not to
mintion th' surroundin' methrolopuses iv Valencia, Wanamaker, Sugar
Works, Paxico an' Snokomo,' he says. 'Th' newspaper, instead iv bein' a
pow'rful agent f'r th' salvation iv mankind, has become something that
they want to r-read,' he says. 'Ye can all go home,' he says. 'I'll stay
here an' write th' paper mesilf,' he says. 'I'm th' best writer ar-round
here, annyhow, an' I'll give thim something that'll prepare thim f'r
death,' he says.

"An' he did, Hinnissy, he did. 'Twas a gran' paper. They was an article
on sewerage an' wan on prayin' f'r rain, an' another on muni-cipal
ownership iv gas tanks, an' wan to show that they niver was a good
milker ownded be a pro-fane man. They was pomes, too, manny iv thim, an'
fine wans: 'Th' Man with th' Shovel,' 'Th' Man with th' Pick, 'Th' Man
with th' Cash-Raygisther,' 'Th' Man with th' Snow Plow,' 'Th' Man with
th' Bell Punch,' 'Th' Man with th' Skate,' 'Th' Man with No Kick
Comin'.' Fine pothry, th' editor askin' who pushed this here man's
forehead back an' planed down his chin, who made him wear clothes that
didn't fit him and got him a job raisin' egg-plant f'r th' monno-polists
in Topeka at a dollar a day. A man in th' editor's position ought to
know, but he didn't, so he ast in th'pomes. An' th' advertisin',
Hinnissy! I'd be scandalized f'r to go back readin' th' common
advertisin' in th' vile daily press about men's pantings, an'
DoesannyoneknowwhereIcangeta biscuit, an' In th' spring a young man's
fancy lightly turns to Pocohontas plug, not made be th' thrusts. Th'
editor left thim sacrilegious advertisements f'r his venal
contimp'raries. His was pious an' nice: 'Do ye'er smokin' in this
wurruld. Th' Christyan Unity Five-Cint See-gar is made out iv th' finest
grades iv excelsior iver projooced in Kansas!' 'Nebuchednezzar grass
seed, f'r man an' beast.' 'A handful iv meal in a barrel an' a little
ile in a curse. Swedenborgian bran fried in kerosene makes th' best
breakfast dish in th' wurruld.' 'Twus nice to r-read. It made a man feel
as if he was in church--asleep."

"How did th'pa-aper sthrike th' people?" says ye. "Oh, it sthruck thim
good. Says th' Topeka man, skinnin' over th' gossip about Christyan
citizenship an' th' toolchest iv pothry: 'Eliza, here's a good paper, a
fine wan, f'r ye an' th' childher. Sind Tommy down to th' corner an' get
me a copy iv th' Polis Gazette.'"

"Ye see, Hinnissy, th' editor wint to th' wrong shop f'r what Hogan
calls his inspiration. Father Kelly was talkin' it over with me, an'
says he: 'They ain't anny news in bein' good. Ye might write th' doin's
iv all th' convents iv th' wurruld on th' back iv a postage stamp, an'
have room to spare. Supposin' ye took out iv a newspaper all th'
murdhers, an' suicides, an' divorces, an elopements, an' fires, an'
disease, an' war, an' famine,' he says, 'ye wudden't have enough left to
keep a man busy r-readin' while he rode ar-roun' th' block on th'
lightnin' express. No,' he says, 'news is sin an' sin is news, an' I'm
worth on'y a line beginnin': "Kelly, at the parish-house, April twinty-
sicond, in th' fiftieth year iv his age," an' pay f'r that, while
Scanlan's bad boy is good f'r a column anny time he goes dhrunk an'
thries to kill a polisman. A rellijious newspaper? None iv thim f'r me.
I want to know what's goin' on among th' murdher an' burglary set. Did
ye r-read it?' he says. 'I did,' says I. 'What did ye think iv it?' says
he. 'I know,' says I, 'why more people don't go to church,' says I."




THE ADMIRAL'S CANDIDACY


"I see," said Mr. Hennessy, "that Dewey is a candydate f'r prisidint."

"Well, sir" said Mr. Dooley, "I hope to hiven he won't get it. No
rilitive iv mine iver held a pollytical job barrin' mesilf. I was
precint captain, an' wan iv th' best they was in thim days, if I do say
so that shudden't. I was called Cap f'r manny years aftherward, an'
I'd've joined th' Gr-rand Army iv th' Raypublic if it hadn't been f'r me
poor feet. Manny iv me rilitives has been candydates, but they niver cud
win out again th' r-rest iv th' fam'ly. 'Tis so with Cousin George. I'm
again him. I've been a rayspictable saloon-keeper f'r forty years in
this ward, an' I'll not have th' name dhragged into pollytics."

"Iv coorse, I don't blame Cousin George. I'm with him f'r annything else
in th' gift iv th' people, fr'm a lovin'-cup to a house an' lot. He
don't mean annything be it. Did ye iver see a sailor thryin' to ride a
horse? 'Tis a comical sight. Th' reason a sailor thries to ride a horse
is because he niver r-rode wan befure. If he knew annything about it he
wouldn't do it. So be Cousin George. Afther he'd been over here awhile
an' got so 'twas safe f'r him to go out without bein' torn to pieces f'r
soovenirs or lynched be a mob, he took a look ar-round him an' says he
to a polisman: 'What's th' governmint iv this counthry"?' 'Tis a
raypublic,' says th' polisman. 'What's th' main guy called?' says
George. 'He's called prisidint,' says th' polisman. 'Is it a good job?'
says Cousin George. ''Tis betther thin thravelin' beat,' says th' bull.
'What's th' la-ad's name that's holdin' it now?' says Cousin George.
'Mack,' says th' cop. 'Irish?' says George. 'Cross,' says th' elbow.
'Where fr'm?' says George. 'Ohio,' says the peeler. 'Where's that?'
says George. 'I dinnaw,' says th' bull. An' they parted th' best iv
frinds."

"'Well,' says George to himsilf, 'I guess I'll have to go up an' have a
look at this la-ad's place,' he says, 'an' if it looks good,' he says,
'p'raps I cud nail it,' he says. An' he goes up an' sees Mack dictatin'
his Porther Rickyan policy to a kinetoscope, an' it looks like a nice
employmint f'r a spry man, an' he goes back home an' sinds f'r a
rayporther, an' says he: 'I always believe since I got home in dealin'
frankly with th' press. I haven't seen manny papers since I've been at
sea, but whin I was a boy me father used to take the Montpelier
Paleejum. 'Twas r-run be a man be th' name iv Horse Clamback. He was
quite a man whin sober. Ye've heerd iv him, no doubt. But what I ast ye
up here f'r was to give ye a item that ye can write up in ye'er own way
an' hand to th' r-rest iv th' boys. I'm goin' to be prisidint. I like
th' looks iv the job an' nobody seems to care f'r it, an' I've got so
blame tired since I left th' ship that if I don't have somethin' to do
I'll go crazy,' he says. 'I wisht ye'd make a note iv it an' give it to
th' other papers,' he says. 'Ar-re ye a raypublican or a dimmycrat"?'
says the rayporter. 'What's that?' says Cousin George. 'D'ye belong to
th' raypublican or th' dimmycrat party?' 'What ar-re they like?' says
Cousin George. 'Th' raypublicans ar-re in favor iv expansion.' 'Thin I'm
a raypublican.' 'Th' dim-mycrats ar-re in favor iv free thrade.' 'Thin
I'm a dimmycrat.' 'Th' raypublicans ar-re f'r upholdin' th' goold
standard.' 'So'm I. I'm a raypublican there.' 'An' they're opposed to an
income tax.' 'On that,' says Cousin George, 'I'm a dimmycrat. I tell ye,
put me down as a dimmycrat. Divvle th' bit I care. Just say I'm a
dimmycrat with sthrong raypublican leanings. Put it this way: I'm a
dimmycrat, be a point raypublican, dimmycrat. Anny sailor man'll
undherstand that.' 'What'll I say ye'er platform is?' 'Platform?' 'Ye
have to stand on a platform.' 'I do, do I? Well, I don't. I'll stand on
no platform, an' I'll hang on no sthrap. What d'ye think th'prisidincy
is--a throlley car? No, sir, whin ye peek in th' dure to sell ye'er
paper ye'll see ye'er Uncle George settin' down comfortable with his
legs crossed, thrippin' up annywan that thries to pass him. Go out now
an' write ye'er little item, f'r 'tis late an' all hands ar-re piped to
bed,' he says."

"An' there ye ar-re. Well, sir, 'tis a hard year Cousin George has in
store f'r him. Th' first thing he knows he'll have to pay f'r havin' his
pitchers in th' pa-aper. Thin he'll larn iv siv'ral prevyous convictions
in Vermont. Thin he'll discover that they was no union label on th'
goods he delivered at Manila. 'Twill be pointed out be careful observers
that he was ilicted prisidint iv th' A. P. A. be th' Jesuits. Thin
somewan'll dig up that story about his not feelin' anny too well th'
mornin' iv th' fight, an' ye can imajine th' pitchers they'll print, an'
th' jokes that'll be made, an' th' songs: 'Dewey Lost His Appetite at
th' Battle iv Manila. Did McKinley Iver Lose His?' An' George'll wake up
th' mornin' afther iliction an' he'll have a sore head an' a sorer
heart, an' he'll find that th' on'y support he got was fr'm th' goold
dimmycratic party, an' th' chances ar-re he caught cold fr'm goin' out
without his shawl an' cudden't vote. He'll find that a man can be r-
right an' be prisidint, but he can't be both at th' same time. An' he'll
go down to breakfast an' issue Gin'ral Ordher Number Wan, 'To All
Superyor Officers Commandin' Admirals iv th' United States navy at home
or on foreign service: If anny man mintions an admiral f'r prisidint,
hit him in th' eye an' charge same to me.' An' thin he'll go to his
office an' prepare a plan f'r to capture Dublin, th' capital iv England,
whin th' nex' war begins. An' he'll spind th' r-rest iv his life thryin'
to live down th' time he was a candydate."

"Well, be hivins, I think if Dewey says he's a dimmycrat an' Joyce is
with him, I'll give him a vote," said Mr. Hennessy. "It's no sin to be a
candydate f'r prisidint."

"No," said Mr. Dooley. "Tis sometimes a misfortune an' sometimes a joke.
But I hope ye won't vote f'r him. He might be ilicted if ye did. I'd
like to raymimber him, an' it might be I cudden't if he got th' job. Who
was the prisidint befure Mack? Oh, tubby sure!"




CUSTOMS OF KENTUCKY


"Well, sir," said Mr. Dooley, "'tis good to see that th' gloryous ol'
commonwealth iv Kentucky is itsilf again."

"How's that?" asked Mr. Hennessy.

"F'r some time past," said Mr. Dooley, "they's been nawthin' doin'
that'd make a meetin' iv th' Epworth League inthrestin'. Th' bystanders
in Kentucky has been as safe as a journeyman highwayman in Chicago.
Perfectly innocent an' unarmed men wint into th' state an' come out
again without a bullethole in their backs. It looked f'r awhile as if
th' life iv th' ordn'ry visitor was goin' to be as harmless in Kentucky
as in Utah, th' home iv th' desthroyers iv American domestic life. I
dinnaw why it was, whether it was th' influence iv our new citizens in
Cubia an' th' Ph'lippeens or what it was, but annyhow th' on'y news that
come out iv Kentucky was as peaceful, Hinnissy, as th' rayports iv a
bloody battle in South Africa. But Kentucky, as Hogan says, was not dead
but on'y sleepin'. Th' other day that gran' ol' state woke up through
two iv its foremost rapid firin' citizens."

"They met be chanst in a hotel con-tagious to a bar. Colonel Derringer
was settin' in a chair peacefully fixin' th' hammer iv his forty-four
Colt gun, presinted to him be his constitooents on th' occasion iv his
mim'rable speech on th' nicissity iv spreadin' th' civilization iv th'
United States to th' ends iv th' wur-ruld. Surroundin' him was Major
Bullseye, a well-known lawyer, cattle-raiser an' journalist iv Athens,
Bulger County, whose desthruction iv Captain Cassius Glaucus Wiggins at
th' meetin' iv' th' thrustees in th' Sicond Baptist Church excited so
much comment among spoortin' men three or four years ago, Gin'ral
Rangefinder iv Thebes, Colonel Chivvy iv Sparta, who whittled Major
Lycurgus Gam iv Thermopylae down to th' wishbone at th' anti-polygamist
meetin' las' June, an' other well-known gintlemen."

"Th' party was suddenly confronted be Major Lyddite iv Carthage an' a
party iv frinds who were in town for th' purpose iv protectin' th'
suffrage again' anny pollution but their own. Colonel Derringer an'
Major Lyddite had been inimies f'r sivral months, iver since Major
Lyddite in an attimpt to desthroy wan iv his fellow-citizens killed a
cow belongin' to th' janial Colonel. Th' two gintlemen had sworn f'r to
slay each other at sight or thirty days, an' all Kentucky society has
been on what Hogan calls th' _quee veev_ or look-out f'r another
thrajeedy to be added to th' long list iv sim'lar ivints that marks th'
histhry iv th' Dark an' Bloody Groun'--which is a name given to Kentucky
be her affectionate sons."

[Illustration]


"Without a wur-rud or a bow both gintlemen dhrew on each other an'
begun a deadly fusillade. That is, Hinnissy, they begun shootin' at th'
bystanders. I'll tell ye what th' pa-apers said about it. Th' two
antagonists was in perfect form an' well sustained th' reputation iv th'
state f'r acc'rate workmanship. Colonel Derringer's first shot caught a
boot an' shoe drummer fr'm Chicago square in th' back amid consid'rable
applause. Major Lyddite tied th' scoor be nailin' a scrubwoman on th'
top iv a ladder. Th' man at th' traps sprung a bell boy whom th' Colonel
on'y winged, thus goin' back wan, but his second barrel brought down a
book-canvasser fr'm New York, an' this bein' a Jew man sint him ahead
three. Th' Major had an aisy wan f'r th' head waiter, nailin' him just
as he jumped into a coal hole. Four all. Th' Colonel thried a difficult
polisman, lamin' him. Thin th' Major turned his attintion to his own
frinds, an' made three twos in succession. Th' Colonel was not so
forch'nate. He caught Major Bullseye an' Captain Wiggins, but Gin'ral
Rangefinder was safe behind a barber's pole an' Colonel Chivvy fluttered
out iv range. Thus th' scoor was tin to six at th' conclusion iv th'
day's spoort in favor iv Major Lyddite. Unforchnately th' gallant Major
was onable f'r to reap th' reward iv his excellent marksmanship, f'r in
a vain indeavor f'r a large scoor, he chased th' barber iv th' sicond
chair into th' street, an' there slippin' on a banana peel, fell an'
sustained injuries fr'm which he subsequently died. In him th' counthry
loses a valu'ble an' acc'rate citizen, th' state a lile an' rapid firin'
son, an' society a leadin' figure, his meat-market an' grocery bein' wan
iv th' largest outside iv Minerva. Some idee iv th' acc'racy iv th' fire
can be gained fr'm th' detailed scoor, as follows: Lyddite, three
hearts, wan lung, wan kidney, five brains. Derringer, four hearts, two
brains. This has seldom been excelled. Among th' minor casualties
resultin' fr'm this painful but delightful soiree was th' followin':
Erastus Haitch Muggins, kilt be jumpin' fr'm th' roof; Blank Cassidy,
hide an' pelt salesman fr'm Chicago, burrid undher victims; Captain
Epaminondas Lucius Quintus Cassius Marcellus Xerxes Cyrus Bangs of
Hoganpolis, Hamilcar Township, Butseen County, died iv hear-rt disease
whin his scoor was tied. Th' las' named was a prominent leader in
society, a crack shot an' a gintleman iv th' ol' school without fear an'
without reproach. His son succeeds to his lunch car. Th' others don't
count."

"'Twas a gr-reat day f'r Kentucky, Hinnissy, an' it puts th' gran' ol'
state two or three notches ahead iv anny sim'lar community in th' wur-
ruld. Talk about th' Boer war an' th' campaign in th' Ph'lippeens! Whin
Kentucky begins f'r to shoot up her fav'rite sons they'll be more blood
spilled thin thim two play wars'd spill between now an' th' time whin
Ladysmith's relieved f'r th' las' time an' Agynaldoo is r-run up a three
in th' outermost corner iv Hoar County, state iv Luzon. They'se rale
shootin' in Kentucky, an' whin it begins ivrybody takes a hand. 'Tis th'
on'y safe way. If ye thry to be an onlooker an' what they calls a non-
combatant 'tis pretty sure ye'll be taken home to ye'er fam'ly lookin'
like a cribbage-boord. So th' thing f'r ye to do is to be wan iv th'
shooters ye'ersilf, load up ye'er gun an' whale away f'r th' honor iv
ye'er counthry."

"'Tis a disgrace," said Mr. Hennessy. "Where were th' polis?"

"This was not th' place f'r a polisman," said Mr. Dooley. "I suspict
though, fr'm me knowledge iv th' kind iv man that uses firear-rms that
if some wan'd had th' prisence iv mind to sing out 'They'se a man at th'
bar that offers to buy dhrinks f'r th' crowd,' they'd be less casu'lties
fr'm bullets, though they might be enough people kilt in th' r-rush to
even it up. But whin I read about these social affairs in Kentucky, I
sometimes wish some spool cotton salesman fr'm Matsachoosets, who'd be
sure to get kilt whin th' shootin' begun, wud go down there with a
baseball bat an' begin tappin' th' gallant gintlemen on th' head befure
breakfast an' in silf definse. I'll bet ye he'd have thim jumpin'
through thransoms in less thin two minyits, f'r ye can put this down as
thrue fr'm wan that's seen manny a shootin', that a man, barrin' he's a
polisman, on'y dhraws a gun whin he's dhrunk or afraid. Th' gun fighter,
Hinnissy, tin to wan is a cow'rd."

"That's so," said Mr. Hennessy. "But it don't do to take anny chances
on."

"No," said Mr. Dooley, "he might be dhrunk."




A SOCIETY SCANDAL


"Well, sir, I guess I'm not up on etiket," said Mr. Dooley.

"How's that?" demanded Mr. Hennessy.

"I've been readin' about Willum Waldorf Asthor," replied Mr. Dooley,
"an' th' throuble he had with a la-ad that bummed his way into his
party. Ye see, Hinnissy, Willum Waldorf Asthor give a party at his large
an' commodjious house in London. That's where he lives--in London--
though he r-runs a hotel in New York, where ye can see half th' state iv
Ioway near anny night, they tell me. Well, he give this party on a gran'
scale, an' bought gr-reat slathers iv food an' dhrink, an' invited th'
neighbors an' the neighbors' childher. But wan man he wudden't have.
He's goin' over th' list iv th' people that's to come, an' he says to
his sicrety: 'Scratch that boy. Him an' me bump as we pass by.' He
didn't want this fellow, ye see, Hinnissy. I don't know why. They was
dissatisfaction between thim; annyhow, he says: 'Scratch him,' an' he
was out iv it."

"Well, wan night, th' fellow was settin' down f'r a bite to eat with
Lady O----, an' Lady S----, an' Lady G----, an' Lady Y----, an' other
ladies that had lost their names, an' says wan iv thim, 'Cap,' she says,
'ar-re ye goin' to Asthor's doin's tonight?' she says. 'Not that I know
iv,' says th' Cap. 'He hasn't sint me anny wurrud that I'm wanted,' he
says. 'What differ does it make,' says th' lady. 'Write an invitation
f'r ye'rsilf on ye'er cuff an' come along with us,' says she. 'I'll do
it,' says the Cap, an' he sint f'r an automobile an' goes along.

"Well, ivrything was all r-right f'r awhile, an' th' Cap was assaultin'
a knuckle iv ham an' a shell iv beer, whin Willum Waldorf Asthor comes
up an' taps him on th' shoulder an' says: 'Duck.' 'What name?' says th'
Cap. 'Asthor,' says Willum. 'Oh,' says th' Cap, 'ye're th' American
gazabo that owns this hut,' he says. 'I am,' says Willum. 'I can't go,'
says th' Cap. 'Ye didn't ask me here an' ye can't sind me away,' he
says. 'Gossoon, another shell iv malt, an' dhraw it more slow,' he says.
'I am an English gintleman an' I know me rights,' he says. 'Dure or
window,' says Willum. 'Take ye'er choice,' he says. 'If ye insist,' says
th' Cap, 'I'll take th' dure,' he says, 'but ye don't know th' customs
iv civilization,' he says; an' th' hired man just grazed him on th' dure
sthep.

"Well, Willum Waldorf Asthor was that mad, he wint down to his pa-aper
office, an' says he, 'I want to put in an item,' he says, an' he put it
in. 'It is wished,' he says, 'to be apprihinded,' he says, 'be those
desirous not to have been misinformed,' he says, 'concarnin' th' recent
appearance iv Cap Sir Mills at me party,' he says, 'that 'twas not be me
that said Cap Sir Mills come to be on th' site,' he says, 'but rather,'
he says, 'through a desire on th' part iv Cap Sir Mills to butt into a
party to which his invitation was lost about three hours befure 'twas
written,' he says."

"Well, now, ye'd think that was all right, wudden't ye? Ye'd say Asthor
acted mild whin he didn't take down his goold ice pick from th' wall an'
bate th' Cap over th' head. Th' Cap, though a ganial soul, had no
business there. 'Twas Willum Waldorf Asthor that paid f'r the ice cream
an' rented th' chiny. But that's where ye'd be wrong, an' that's where I
was wrong. Whin th' Prince iv Wales heerd iv it he was furyous. 'What,'
he says, 'is an English gintleman goin' to be pegged out iv dures be a
mere American be descent?' he says. 'A man,' he says, 'that hasn't an
entail to his name,' he says. 'An American's home in London is an
Englishman's castle,' he says. 'As th' late Earl iv Pitt said, th'
furniture may go out iv it, th' constable may enther, th' mortgage may
fall on th' rooned roof, but a thrue Englishman'll niver leave,' he
says, 'while they'se food an' dhrink,' he says. 'Willum Waldorf Asthor
has busted th' laws iv hospitality, an' made a monkey iv a lile subjick
iv th' queen,' he says. 'Hinceforth,' he says, 'he's ast to no picnics
iv th' Buckingham Palace Chowder Club,' he says. An' th' nex' day Willum
Waldorf Asthor met him at th' races where he was puttin' down a bit iv
money an' spoke to him, an' th' Prince iv Wales gave him wan in th' eye.
He must've had something in his hand, f'r the pa-aper said he cut him.
P'raps 'twas his scipter. An' now no wan'll speak to Willum Waldorf
Asthor, an' he's not goin' to be a jook at all, an' he may have to come
back here an' be nachurlized over again like a Bohamian. He's all broke
up about it. He's gone to Germany to take a bath."

"Lord, help us," said Mr. Hennessy, "can't he get wan nearer home?"

"It seems not," said Mr. Dooley. "Mebbe the Prince iv Wales has had th'
wather cut off. He has a big pull with th' people in th' city hall."




DOINGS OF ANARCHISTS


"Why should anny man want to kill a king?" said Mr. Dooley. "That's
what I'd like to know. Little gredge have I again' anny monarch in th'
deck. Live an' let live's me motto. Th' more ye have in this wurruld th'
less ye have. Make in wan place, lose in another's th' rule, me boy.
Little joy, little sorrow. Takin' it all an' all I'd rather be where I
am thin on a throne, an' be th' look iv things I'll have me wish. 'Tis
no aisy job bein' a king barrin' th' fact that ye don't have to marry
th' woman iv ye'er choice but th' woman iv somebody else's. 'Tis like
takin' a conthract an' havin' th' union furnish th' foreman an' th'
mateeryal. Thin if th' wurruk ain't good a wild-eyed man fr'm Paterson,
Noo Jarsey, laves his monkey an' his hand organ an' takes a shot at ye.
Thank th' Lord I'm not so big that anny man can get comfort fr'm pumpin'
a Winchester at me fr'm th' top iv a house."

"But if I was king ne'er an organ grinder'd get near enough me to take
me life with a Hotchkiss gun. I'd be so far away fr'm the multitood,
Hinnissy, that they cud on'y distinguish me rile features with a spy-
glass. I'd have polismen at ivry tur-rn, an' I'd have me subjicks retire
to th' cellar whin I took me walk. Divvle a bit wud you catch me
splattherin' mesilf with morthar an' stickin' newspapers in a hole in a
corner shtone to show future gin'rations th' progress iv crime in this
cinchry. They'd lay their own corner-shtone f'r all iv me. I'd
communicate with th' pop'lace be means iv ginral ordhers, an' I'd make
it a thing worth tellin' about to see th' face iv th' gr-reat an' good
King Dooley."

"Kings is makin' thimsilves too common. Nowadays an arnychist dhrops
into a lunch-room at th' railroad depot an' sees a man settin' on a
stool atin' a quarther section iv a gooseb'ry pie an' dhrinkin' a glass
iv buttermilk. 'D'ye know who that is?' says th' lunch-counter lady. 'I
do not,' says th' arnychist, 'but be th' look iv him he ain't much.'
'That's th' king,' says th' lady. 'Th' king, is it,' says th' arnychist.
'Thin here's f'r wan king less,' he says, an' 'tis all over. A king
ought to be a king or he oughtn't. He don't need to be a good mixer. If
he wants to hang on he must keep out iv range. 'Tis th' kings an' queens
that thrusts so much in th' lilety iv their people that they live in
summer resort hotels an' go out walkin' with a dog that's hurted. Th'
on'y person that ought to be able to get near enough a rale king to kill
him is a jook, or th' likes iv that. Th' idee iv a man from Noo Jarsey
havin' th' chanst!"

"What on earth's to be done about thim arnychists?" Mr. Hennessy asked.
"What ails thim annyhow? What do they want?"

"Th' Lord on'y knows," said Mr. Dooley.

"They don't want annything, that's what they want. They want peace on
earth an' th' way they propose to get it is be murdhrin' ivry man that
don't agree with thim. They think we all shud do as they please. They're
down on th' polis foorce an' in favor iv th' pop'lace, an' whin they've
kilt a king they call on th' polis to save thim fr'm th' mob. An'
between you an' me, Hinnissy, ivry arnychist I've knowed, an' I've met
manny in me time, an' quite, law-abidin' citizens they was, too, had th'
makin' iv a thradeejan in him. If they was no newspapers they'd be few
arnychists. They want to get their pitchers in th' pa-apers an' they
can't do it be wheelin' bananas through th' sthreets or milkin' a cow,
so they go out an' kill a king. I used to know a man be th' name iv
Schmitt that was a cobbler be profession an' lived next dure but wan to
me. He was th' dacintist man ye iver see. He kep' a canary bur-rd, an'
his devotion to his wife was th' scandal iv th' neighborhood. But bless
my soul, how he hated kings. He cudden't abide Cassidy afther he heerd
he was a dayscinded fr'm th' kings iv Connock, though Cassidy was what
ye call a prolotoorio or a talkin' workin'man. An' th' wan king he hated
above all others was th' king iv Scholizwig-Holstein, which was th'
barbarous counthry he come fr'm. He cud talk fairly dacint about other
kings, but this wan--Ludwig was his name an' I seen his pitcher in th'
pa-apers wanst--wud throw him into a fit. He blamed ivrything that
happened to Ludwig. If they was a sthrike he charged it to Ludwig. If
Schwartzmeister didn't pay him f'r half-solin' a pair iv Congress
gaiters he used to wear in thim days, he tied a sthring arround his
finger f'r to remind him that he had to kill Ludwig. 'What have ye
again' th' king?' says I. 'He is an opprissor iv th' poor,' he says. 'So
ar-re ye,' I says, 'or ye'd mend boots free.' 'He's explodin' th'
prolotoorio,' he says. 'Sure,' says I, 'th' prolotoorio can explode
thimsilves pretty well,' says I. 'He oughtn't to be allowed to live in
luxury while others starve,' he says. 'An' wud ye be killin' a man f'r
holdin' a nice job?' says I. 'What good wud it do ye?' says I. 'I'd be
th' emancipator iv th' people,' says he. 'Ye'd have th' wurred on th'
coffin lid,' says I. 'Why,' says he, 'think iv me, Schmitt, Owgoost
Schmitt, stalkin' forth to avinge th' woes iv th' poor,' he says.
'Loodwig, th' cursed, goes by. I jumps fr'm behind a three an' society
is freed fr'm th' monsther,' he says. 'Think iv th' glory iv it,' he
says. 'Owgoost Schmitt, emancipator,' he says. 'I'll prove to Mary Ann
that I'm a man,' he says. Mary Ann was his wife. Her maiden name was
Riley. She heard him say it. 'Gus,' says she, 'if iver I hear iv ye
shootin' e'er a king I'll lave ye,' she says."

"Well, sir, I thought he was jokin', but be hivins, wan day he
disappeared, an' lo an' behold, two weeks afther I picks up a pa-aper
an' r-reads that me brave Schmitt was took up be th' polis f'r thryin'
to cop a monarch fr'm behind a three. I sint him a copy iv a pa-aper
with his pitcher in it, but I don't know if iver he got it. He's over
there now an' his wife is takin' in washin'."

"It's vanity that makes arnychists, Hinnissy--vanity an' th' habits
kings has nowadays iv bein' as common as life insurance agents."

"I don't like kings," said Mr. Hennessy, "but I like arnychists less.
They ought to be kilt off as fast as they're caught."

"They'll be that," said Mr. Dooley. "But killin' thim is like wringin'
th' neck iv a mickrobe."




ANGLO-AMERICAN SPORTS


"Hinnissy, if iver we have war with what me frind Carl Schurz'd call th'
Mother County, it'll not come fr'm anny Vinnyzwalan question. Ye can't
get me excited over th' throbbin' debate on th' location iv th' Orynocoo
River or whether th' miners that go to Alaska f'r goold ar're buried be
th' Canajeen or th' American authorities. Ye bet ye can't. But some day
we'll be beat in a yacht r-race or done up at futball an' thin what
Hogan call th' dogs iv war'll break out iv th' kennel an' divastate th'
wurruld."

"Well," said Mr. Hennessy, complacently, "if we wait f'r that we might
as well disband our navy."

"I dinnaw about that," said Mr. Dooley, "I dinnaw abut that; afther ye
left to investigate th' ir'n foundhries an' other pitcheresque roons iv
this misguided counthry, I wint out to give a few raw rahs f'r me fellow
colleejens, who was attimptin' to dimonsthrate their supeeryority over
th' effete scholars iv England at what I see be th' pa-apers is called
th' Olympian games. Ye get to th' Olympian games be suffocation in a
tunnel. Whin ye come to, ye pay four shillin's or a dollar in our
degraded currency, an' stand in th' sun an' look at th' Prince iv Wales.
Th' Prince iv Wales looks at ye, too, but he don't see ye."

"Me frind, th' American ambassadure was there, an' manny iv th' seats iv
larnin' in th' gran' stand was occupied be th' flower iv our seminaries
iv meditation or thought conservatories. I r-read it in th' pa-apers. At
th' time I come in they was recitin' a pome fr'm th' Greek, to a
thoughtful-lookin' young profissor wearin' th' star-spangled banner f'r
a necktie an' smokin' a cigareet. 'Now, boys,' says th' profissor, 'all
together.' 'Rickety, co-ex, co-ex, hullabaloo, bozoo, bozoo, Harvard,'
says th' lads. I was that proud iv me belovid counthry that I wanted to
take off me hat there an' thin an' give th' colledge yell iv th' Ar-
rchey road reform school. But I was resthrained be a frind iv mine that
I met comin' over. He was fr'm Matsachoosetts, an' says he: 'Don't make
a disturbance,' he says. 'We've got to create a fav'rable impression
here,' he says, 'Th' English,' he says, 'niver shows enthusyasm,' he
says. 'Tis regarded as unpolite,' he says. 'If ye yell,' he says,
'they'll think we want to win,' he says, 'an' we didn't come over here
to win,' he says. 'Let us show thim,' he says, 'that we're gintlemen, be
it iver so painful,' he says. An' I resthrained mesilf be puttin' me
fist in me mouth."

[Illustration]

"They was an Englishman standin' behind me, Hinnissy, an' he was a model
iv behaviour f'r all Americans intindin' to take up their homes in
Cubia. Ye cudden't get this la-ad war-rmed up if ye built a fire undher
him. He had an eye-glass pinned to his face an' he niver even smiled
whin a young gintleman fr'm Harvard threw a sledge hammer wan mile, two
inches. A fine la-ad, that Harvard man, but if throwin' th' hammer's
spoort, thin th' rowlin' mills is th' athletic cintre iv our belovid
counthry. Whin an Englishman jumped further thin another la-ad, me frind
th' Ice-box, says he: 'H'yah, h'yah!' So whin an American la-ad lept up
in th' air as though he'd been caught be th' anchor iv a baloon, I says:
'H'yah, h'yah!' too. Whin a sign iv th' effete aristocracy iv England
done up sivral free-bor-rn Americans fr'm Boston in a fut r-race, me
frind the Farthest North, he grabs his wan glass eye an' says he: 'Well
r-run, Cambridge!' he says; 'Well r-run,' he says. An' 'Well r-run,
whativer colledge ye're fr'm,' says I, whin wan iv our la-ads jumped
over a fence ahead iv some eager but consarvative English scholars."

"Well, like a good game, it come three an' three. Three times had
victhry perched upon our banner an' thrice--I see it in th' pa-aper--had
th' flag iv th' mother counthry proclaimed that Englishmen can r-run. It
was thryin' on me narves an' I wanted to yell whin th' tie was r-run off
but th' man fr'm Matsachoosetts says: 'Contain ye'ersilf,' he says.
'Don't allow ye'er frinzied American spirit to get away with ye'er
manners,' he says. 'Obsarve.' he says, 'th' ca'm with which our brother
Anglo-Saxon views th' scene,' he says. 'Ah!' he says, 'they're off an'
be th' jumpin' George Wash'nton, I bet ye that fellow fr'm West
Newton'll make that red-headed, long-legged, bread-ballasted Englishman
look like thirty cints. 'Hurroo,' he says. 'Go on, Harvard,' he says.
'Go on,' he says. 'Rah, rah, rah,' he says. 'Ate him up, chew him up,'
he says. 'Harvard!' he says."

"I looked ar-round at th' ca'm dispassyonate Englishman. He dhropped his
eye-glass so he cud see th' race an' he had his cane in th' air. 'Well
r-run,' he says. 'Well r-run, Cambridge,' he says. 'Pull him down,' he
says. 'Run over him,' he says. 'Thrip him up,' he says. 'They can't r-
run,' he says, 'except whin they're Ph'lipinos behind thim,' he says.
'Well r-run,' he says, an' he welted th' man fr'm Matsachoosetts with
his cane. 'Be careful what ye're doin' there,' says th' Anglo-Saxon. 'If
it wasn't f'r th' 'liance I'd punch ye'er head off,' he says. 'An','
says th' ca'm Englishman, 'if it wasn't f'r our common hurtage,' he
says, 'I'd make ye jump over th' gran' stand,' he says. 'Th' English
always cud beat us r-runnin',' says the sage iv Matsachoosetts. 'Th'
Americans start first an' finishes last,' says th' Englishman. An' I had
to pull thim apart."

"Whether it is that our American colleejans spinds too much iv their
lung power in provin' their devotion to what Hogan calls their Almy
Matthers or not, I dinnaw, but annyhow, we had to dhrag th'
riprisintative iv our branch iv th' Anglo-Saxon an' Boheemyan
civilization in th' three-mile race fr'm undher two thousand iv our
cousins or brothers-in-law that was ca'mly an' soberly, but hurridly an'
noisily chargin' acrost th' thrack to cheer their own man."

"Me frind fr'm Matsachoosets was blue as we winded our way to th'
sthrangulation railway an' started back f'r home. 'I'm sorry,' he says,
'to lose me timper,' he says, 'but,' he says, 'afther all th' pretinded
affection iv these people f'r us,' he says, 'an' afther all we've done
f'r thim in Alaska an'--an' ivrywhere,' he says, 'an' thim sellin' us
coal whin they might've sold it to th' Spanyards if th' Spanyards'd had
th' money,' he says, 'to see th' conduct iv that coarse an' brutal
Englishman--' 'Th' wan that won th' r-race?' says I. 'Yes,' he says.
'No, I mean th' wan that lammed me with his cane,' he says. 'If it
hadn't been,' he says, 'that we're united,' he says, 'be a common
pathrimony,' he says, 'I'd've had his life,' he says. 'Ye wud so,' says
I, 'an' ye're r-right,' I says. 'If all th' la-ads enthered into th' r-
races with th' same spirit ye show now,' I says, 'th' English flag'd be
dhroopin' fr'm th' staff, an' Cyrus Bodley iv Wadham, Mass.,'d be
paintin' th' stars an' sthripes on th' Nelson monnymint,' I says. 'Whin
we hated th' English,' I says, 'an' a yacht r-race was li'ble to end in
a war message fr'm the prisidint, we used to bate thim,' I says. 'Now,'
says I, 'whin we're afraid to injure their feelin's,' I says, 'an' whin
we 'pologise befure we punch, they bate us,' I says. 'They're used to
'pologisin' with wan hand an' punchin' with th' other,' I says. 'Th'
on'y way is th' way iv me cousin Mike,' I says. 'He was a gr-reat
rassler an' whin he had a full Nelson on th' foolish man that wint again
him, he used to say, 'Dear me, am I breakin' ye'er neck, I hope so.'"

"But th' Matsachoosetts man didn't see it that way. An' some time, I
tell ye, Hinnissy, an' Englishman'll put th' shot wan fut further than
wan iv our men th' Lord save us fr'm th' disgrace!--an' th' next day
we'll invade Canada."

"We ought to do it, annyhow," said Mr. Hennessy stoutly.

"We wud," said Mr. Dooley, "if we were sure we cud lave it aftherwards."




VOICES FROM THE TOMB


"I don't think," said Mr. Dooley, "that me frind Willum Jennings Bryan
is as good an orator as he was four years ago."

"He's th' grandest talker that's lived since Dan'l O'Connell," said Mr.
Hennessy.

"Ye've heerd thim all an' ye know," said Mr. Dooley. "But I tell ye he's
gone back. D'ye mind th' time we wint down to th' Coleesyum an' he come
out in a black alapaca coat an' pushed into th' air th' finest wurruds
ye iver heerd spoke in all ye'er bor-rn days? 'Twas a balloon ascinsion
an' th' las' days iv Pompey an' a blast on th' canal all in wan. I had
to hold on to me chair to keep fr'm goin' up in th' air, an' I mind that
if it hadn't been f'r a crack on th' head ye got fr'm a dillygate fr'm
Westconsin ye'd 've been in th' hair iv Gin'ral Bragg. Dear me, will ye
iver f'rget it, th' way he pumped it into th' pluthocrats? 'I tell ye
here an' now,' he says, 'they'se as good business men in th' quite
counthry graveyards iv Kansas as ye can find in the palathial lunch-
counthers iv Wall street,' he says. 'Whin I see th' face iv that man who
looks like a two-dollar pitcher iv Napolyeon at Saint Heleena,' he says,
'I say to mesilf, ye shall not--ye shall not'--what th' divvle is it ye
shall not do, Hinnissy?"

"Ye shall not crucify mankind upon a crown iv thorns," said Mr.
Hennessy.

"Right ye ar-re, I forgot," Mr. Dooley went on. "Well, thim were his own
wurruds. He was young an' he wanted something an' he spoke up. He'd been
a rayporther on a newspaper an' he'd rather be prisidint thin write anny
longer f'r th' pa-aper, an' he made th' whole iv th' piece out iv his
own head.

"But nowadays he has tin wurruds f'r Thomas Jefferson an' th' rest iv
th' sage crop to wan f'r himsilf. 'Fellow-dimmycrats,' he says, 'befure
goin' anny farther, an' maybe farin' worse, I reluctantly accipt th'
nommynation f'r prisidint that I have caused ye to offer me,' he says,
'an' good luck to me,' he says. 'Seein' th' counthry in th' condition it
is,' he says, 'I cannot rayfuse,' he says. 'I will now lave a subject
that must be disagreeable to manny iv ye an' speak a few wurruds fr'm
th' fathers iv th' party, iv whom there ar-re manny,' he says, 'though
no shame to th' party, f'r all iv that,' he says. 'Thomas Jefferson, th'
sage iv Monticello, says: "Ye can't make a silk purse out iv a sow's
ear," a remark that will at wanst recall th' sayin' iv Binjamin
Franklin, th' sage iv Camden, that "th' fartherest way ar-round is th'
shortest way acrost." Nawthin' cud be thruer thin that onliss it is th'
ipygram iv Andhrew Jackson, th' sage iv Syr-acuse, that "a bur-rd in th'
hand is worth two in th' bush." What gran' wurruds thim ar-re, an' how
they must torture th' prisint leaders iv th' raypublican party. Sam'l
Adams, th' sage iv Salem, says: "Laugh an' the wurruld laughs with ye,"
while Pathrick Hinnery, th' sage iv Jarsey City, puts it that "ye shud
always bet aces befure th' dhraw." Turnin' farther back into histhry we
find that Brian Boru, th' sage iv Munsther, said: "Cead mille failthe,"
an' Joolyus Caesar, th' sage iv Waukeesha, says, "Whin ye're in Rome, do
th' Romans." Nebuchedneezar--there's a name f'r ye--th' sage iv I-
dinnaw-where, says: "Ye can't ate ye'er hay an' have it." Solomon, th'
sage iv Sageville, said, "Whin a man's marrid his throubles begins," an'
Adam, th' sage iv Eden, put it that "A snake in th' grass is worth two
in th' boots." Ye'll see be this, me good an' thrue frinds, that th'
voices fr'm th' tombs is united in wan gran' chorus f'r th' ticket ye
have nommynated. I will say no more, but on a future occasion, whin I've
been down in southern Injyanny, I'll tell ye what th' sages an' fathers
iv th' party in th' Ancient an' Hon'rable Association iv Mound-Builders
had to say about th' prisint crisis.'"

"'Tisn't Bryan alone, Mack's th' same way. They're both ancesther
worshippers, like th' Chinese, Hinnissy. An' what I'd like to know is
what Thomas Jefferson knew about th' throubles iv ye an' me? Divvle a
wurrud have I to say again' Thomas. He was a good man in his day, though
I don't know that his battin' av'rage 'd be high again' th' pitchin' iv
these times. I have a gr-reat rayspict f'r the sages an' I believe in
namin' sthreets an' public schools afther thim. But suppose Thomas
Jefferson was to come back here now an' say to himsilf: 'They'se a good
dimmycrat up in Ar-rchy road an' I think I'll dhrop in on him an' talk
over th' issues iv th' day.' Well, maybe he cud r-ride his old gray mare
up an' not be kilt be the throlley cars, an' maybe th' la-ads'd think he
was crazy an' not murdher him f'r his clothes. An' maybe they wudden't.
But annyhow, suppose he got here, an' afther he'd fumbled ar-round at
th' latch--f'r they had sthrings on th' dure in thim days--I let him in.
Well, whin I've injooced him to take a bowl iv red liquor--f'r in his
time th' dhrink was white--an' explained how th' seltzer comes out an'
th' cash raygisther wurruks, an' wather is dhrawn fr'm th' fassit, an'
gas is lighted fr'm th' burner, an' got him so he wud not bump his head
again' th' ceilin' ivry time th' beer pump threw a fit--afther that we'd
talk iv the pollytical situation."

"'How does it go?' says Thomas. 'Well,' says I, 'it looks as though
Ioway was sure raypublican,' says I. 'Ioway?' says he. 'What's that?'
says he. 'Ioway,' says I, 'is a state,' says I. 'I niver heerd iv it,'
says he. 'Faith ye did not,' says I. 'But it's a state just th' same,
an' full iv corn an' people,' I says. 'An' why is it raypublican?' says
he. 'Because,' says I, 'th' people out there is f'r holdin' th'
Ph'lippeens,' says I. 'What th' divvle ar-re th' Ph'lippeens?' says he.
'Is it a festival,' says he, 'or a dhrink?' he says. 'Faith, 'tis small
wondher ye don't know,' says I, 'f'r 'tis mesilf was weak on it a year
ago,' I says. 'Th' Ph'lippeens is an issue,' says I, 'an' islands,' says
I, 'an' a public nuisance,' I says. 'But,' I says, 'befure we go anny
further on this subject,' I says, 'd'ye know where Minnysota is, or
Westconsin, or Utah, or Californya, or Texas, or Neebrasky?' says I. 'I
do not,' says he. 'D'ye know that since ye'er death there has growed up
on th' shore iv Lake Mitchigan a city that wud make Rome look like a
whistlin' station--a city that has a popylation iv eight million people
till th' census rayport comes out?' I says. 'I niver heerd iv it,' he
says. 'D'ye know that I can cross th' ocean in six days, an' won't; that
if annything doesn't happen in Chiny I can larn about it in twinty-four
hours if I care to know; that if ye was in Wash'nton I cud call ye up be
tillyphone an ye'er wire'd be busy?' I says. 'I do not,' says Thomas
Jefferson. 'Thin,' says I, 'don't presume to advise me,' I says, 'that
knows these things an' manny more,' I says. 'An' whin ye go back where
ye come fr'm an' set down with th' rest iv th' sages to wondher whether
a man cud possibly go fr'm Richmond to Boston in a week, tell thim,' I
says, 'that in their day they r-run a corner grocery an' to-day,' says
I, 'we're op'ratin' a sixteen-story department store an' puttin' in
ivrything fr'm an electhric lightin' plant to a set iv false teeth,' I
says. An' I hist him on his horse an' ask a polisman to show him th' way
home."

"Be hivins, Hinnissy, I want me advice up-to-date, an' whin Mack an'
Willum Jennings tells me what George Wash'nton an' Thomas Jefferson
said, I says to thim: 'Gintlemen, they larned their thrade befure th'
days iv open plumbin',' I says. 'Tell us what is wanted ye'ersilf or
call in a journeyman who's wurrukin' card is dated this cinchry,' I
says. 'An' I'm r-right too, Hinnissy.'"

"Well," said Mr. Hennessy, slowly, "those ol' la-ads was level-headed."

"Thrue f'r ye," said Mr. Dooley. "But undher th' new iliction laws ye
can't vote th' cimitries."




_The_ NEGRO PROBLEM


"What's goin' to happen to th' naygur?" asked Mr. Hennessy.

"Well," said Mr. Dooley, "he'll ayther have to go to th' north an' be a
subjick race, or stay in th' south an' be an objick lesson. 'Tis a har-
rd time he'll have, annyhow. I'm not sure that I'd not as lave be gently
lynched in Mississippi as baten to death in New York. If I was a black
man, I'd choose th' cotton belt in prifrince to th' belt on th' neck
fr'm th' polisman's club. I wud so."

"I'm not so much throubled about th' naygur whin he lives among his
opprissors as I am whin he falls into th' hands iv his liberators. Whin
he's in th' south he can make up his mind to be lynched soon or late an'
give his attintion to his other pleasures iv composin' rag-time music on
a banjo, an' wurrukin' f'r th' man that used to own him an' now on'y
owes him his wages. But 'tis th' divvle's own hardship f'r a coon to
step out iv th' rooms iv th' S'ciety f'r th' Brotherhood iv Ma-an where
he's been r-readin' a pome on th' 'Future of th' Moke' an' be pursooed
be a mob iv abolitionists till he's dhriven to seek polis protection,
which, Hinnissy, is th' polite name f'r fracture iv th' skull.

"I was f'r sthrikin' off th' shackles iv th' slave, me la-ad. 'Twas
thrue I didn't vote f'r it, bein' that I heerd Stephen A. Douglas say
'twas onconstitootional, an' in thim days I wud go to th' flure with
anny man f'r th' constitootion. I'm still with it, but not sthrong. It's
movin' too fast f'r me. But no matther. Annyhow I was f'r makin' th'
black man free, an' though I shtud be th' south as a spoortin'
proposition I was kind iv glad in me heart whin Gin'ral Ulyss S. Grant
bate Gin'ral Lee an' th' rest iv th' Union officers captured Jeff Davis.
I says to mesilf, 'Now,' I says,'th' coon'll have a chanst f'r his
life,' says I, 'an' in due time we may injye him,' I says.

"An' sure enough it looked good f'r awhile, an' th' time come whin th'
occas'nal dollar bill that wint acrost this bar on pay night wasn't good
money onless it had th' name iv th' naygur on it. In thim days they was
a young la-ad--a frind iv wan iv th' Donohue boys--that wint to th'
public school up beyant, an' he was as bright a la-ad as ye'd want to
see in a day's walk. Th' larnin' iv him wud sind Father Kelly back to
his grammar. He cud spell to make a hare iv th' hedge schoolmasther, he
was as quick at figures as th' iddycated pig they showed in th' tint
las' week in Haley's vacant lot, and in joggerphy, asthronomy,
algybbera, jommethry, chimisthry, physiojnomy, bassoophly an' fractions,
I was often har-rd put mesilf to puzzle him. I heerd him gradyooate an'
his composition was so fine very few cud make out what he meant.

"I met him on th' sthreet wan day afther he got out iv school. 'What ar-
re ye goin' to do f'r ye'ersilf, Snowball,' says I--his name was Andhrew
Jackson George Wash'n'ton Americus Caslateras Beresford Vanilla Hicks,
but I called him 'Snowball,' him bein' as black as coal, d'ye see--I
says to him: 'What ar-re ye goin' to do f'r ye'ersilf?' I says. 'I'm
goin' to enther th' profission iv law,' he says, 'where be me acooman
an' industhry I hope,' he says, 'f'r to rise to be a judge,' he says, 'a
congrissman,' he says, 'a sinator,' he says, 'an' p'rhaps,' he says, 'a
prisidint iv th' United States,' he says. 'Theyse nawthin to prevint,'
he says. 'Divvle a thing,' says I. 'Whin we made ye free,' says I, 'we
opened up all these opporchunities to ye,' says I. 'Go on,' says I, 'an'
enjye th' wealth an' position conferred on ye be th' constitootion,' I
says. 'On'y,' I says, 'don't be too free,' I says. 'Th' freedom iv th'
likes iv ye is a good thing an' a little iv it goes a long way,' I says,
'an' if I ever hear iv ye bein' prisidint iv th' United States,' I says,
'I'll take me whitewashing' away fr'm ye'er father, ye excelsior hair,
poached-egg eyed, projiny iv tar,' I says, f'r me Anglo-Saxon feelin'
was sthrong in thim days.

"Well, I used to hear iv him afther that defindin' coons in th' polis
coort, an' now an' thin bein' mintioned among th' scatthrin' in
raypublican county con-vintions, an' thin he dhropped out iv sight.
'Twas years befure I see him again. Wan day I was walkin' up th' levee
smokin' a good tin cint seegar whin a coon wearin' a suit iv clothes
that looked like a stained glass window in th' house iv a Dutch brewer
an' a pop bottle in th' fr-ront iv his shirt, steps up to me an' he
says: 'How dy'e do, Mistah Dooley,' says he. 'Don't ye know me--Mistah
Hicks?' he says. 'Snowball,' says I. 'Step inside this dureway,' says I,
'less Clancy, th' polisman on th' corner, takes me f'r an octoroon,' I
says. 'What ar-re ye do-in'?' says I. 'How did ye enjye th' prisidincy?'
says I. He laughed an' told me th' story iv his life. He wint to
practisin' law an' found his on'y clients was coons, an' they had no
assets but their vote at th' prim'ry. Besides a warrant f'r a moke was
the same as a letther iv inthroduction to th' warden iv th' pinitinchry.
Th' on'y thing left f'r th' lawyer to do was to move f'r a new thrile
an' afther he'd got two or three he thought ol' things was th' best an'
ye do well to lave bad enough alone. He got so sick iv chicken he
cudden't live on his fees an' he quit th' law an' wint into journalism.
He r-run 'Th' Colored Supplimint,' but it was a failure, th' taste iv
th' public lanin' more to quadhroon publications, an' no man that owned
a resthrant or theaytre or dhrygoods store'd put in an adver-tisemint
f'r fear th' subscribers'd see it an' come ar-round. Thin he attimpted
to go into pollytics, an' th' best he cud get was carryin' a bucket iv
wather f'r a Lincoln Club. He thried to larn a thrade an' found th' on'y
place a naygur can larn a thrade is in prison an' he can't wurruk at
that without committin' burglary. He started to take up subscriptions
f'r a sthrugglin' church an' found th' profission was overcrowded.
'Fin'ly,' says he, ''twas up to me to be a porther in a saloon or go
into th' on'y business,' he says, 'in which me race has a chanst,' he
says. 'What's that?' says I. 'Craps,' says he. 'I've opened a palachal
imporyium,' he says, 'where,' he says, ''twud please me very much,' he
says, 'me ol' abolitionist frind,' he says, 'if ye'd dhrop in some day,'
he says, 'an' I'll roll th' sweet, white bones f'r ye,' he says. ''Tis
th' hope iv me people,' he says. 'We have an even chanst at ivry other
pursoot,' he says, 'but 'tis on'y in craps we have a shade th' best iv
it,' he says."

"So there ye ar-re, Hinnissy. An' what's it goin' to come to, says ye?
Faith, I don't know an' th' naygurs don't know, an' be hivins, I think
if th' lady that wrote th' piece we used to see at th' Halsted Sthreet
Opry House come back to earth, she wudden't know. I used to be all broke
up about Uncle Tom, but cud I give him a job tindin' bar in this here
liquor store? I freed th' slave, Hinnissy, but, faith, I think' twas
like tur-rnin' him out iv a panthry into a cellar."

"Well, they got to take their chances," said Mr. Hennessy. "Ye can't do
annything more f'r thim than make thim free."

"Ye can't," said Mr. Dooley; "on'y whin ye tell thim they're free they
know we're on'y sthringin' thim."




_The_ AMERICAN STAGE


"I've niver been much iv a hand f'r th' theaytre," said Mr. Dooley.
"Whin I was a young man an' Crosby's Opry house was r-runnin' I used to
go down wanst in a while an' see Jawn Dillon throwin' things around f'r
th' amusemint iv th' popylace an' whin Shakespere was played I often had
a seat in th' gal'ry, not because I liked th' actin', d'ye mind, but
because I'd heerd me frind Hogan speak iv Shakespere. He was a good man,
that Shakespere, but his pieces is full iv th' ol' gags that I heerd
whin I was a boy. Th' throuble with me about goin' to plays is that no
matther where I set I cud see some hired man in his shirt sleeves
argyin' with wan iv his frinds about a dog fight while Romeo was makin'
th' kind iv love ye wuddent want ye'er daughter to hear to Juliet in th'
little bur-rd cage they calls a balcony. It must've been because I wanst
knowed a man be th' name iv Gallagher that was a scene painter that I
cud niver get mesilf to th' pint iv concedin' that th' mountains that
other people agreed was manny miles in th' distance was in no danger iv
bein' rubbed off th' map be th' coat-tails iv wan iv th' principal char-
ackters. An' I always had me watch out to time th' moon whin' twas
shoved acrost th' sky an' th' record breakin' iv day in th' robbers'
cave where th' robbers don't dare f'r to shtep on the rock f'r fear
they'll stave it in. If day iver broke on th' level th' way it does on
th' stage 'twud tear th' bastin' threads out iv what Hogan calls th'
firmymint. Hogan says I haven't got th' dhramatic delusion an' he must
be r-right f'r ye can't make me believe that twinty years has elapsed
whin I know that I've on'y had time to pass th' time iv day with th'
bartinder nex' dure.

"Plays is upside down, Hinnissy, an' inside out. They begin with a full
statement iv what's goin' to happen an' how it's goin' to come out an'
thin ye're asked to forget what ye heerd an' be surprised be th'
outcome. I always feel like goin' to th' office an' gettin' me money or
me lithograph pass back afther th' first act.

"Th' way to write a play is f'r to take a book an' write it over hindend
foremost. They're puttin' all books on th' stage nowadays. Fox's 'Book
iv Martyrs' has been done into a three-act farce-comedy an'll be
projooced be Delia Fox, th' author, nex' summer. Webster's 'Onabridge
Ditchnry' will be brought out as a society dhrama with eight hundherd
thousan' char-ackters. Th' 'Constitution iv th' United States' (a farce)
be Willum McKinley is r-runnin' to packed houses with th' cillybrated
thradeejan Aggynaldoo as th' villain. In th' sixteenth scene iv th' last
act they'se a naygur lynchin'. James H. Wilson, th' author iv 'Silo an'
Ensilage, a story f'r boys,' is dhramatizin' his cillybrated wurruk an'
will follow it with a dhramatic version iv 'Sugar Beet Culture,' a farm
play. 'Th' Familiar Lies iv Li Hung Chang' is expicted to do well in th'
provinces an' Hostetter's Almanac has all dates filled, I undherstand
th' bible'll be r-ready f'r th' stage undher th'direction iv Einstein
an' Opperman befure th' first iv th' year. Some changes has been
niciss'ry f'r to adapt it to stage purposes, I see be th' pa-apers. Th'
authors has become convinced that Adam an' Eve must be carrid through
th' whole play, so they have considerably lessened th' time between th'
creation an' th' flood an' have made Adam an English nobleman with a
shady past an' th' Divvle a Fr-rinch count in love with Eve. They're
rescued be Noah, th' faithful boatman who has a comic naygur son."

"I see be th' pa-aper th' stage is goin' to th' dogs what with it's
Sappho's an' th' like iv that," said Mr. Hennessy.

"Well, it isn't what it used to be," said Mr. Dooley, "in th' days whin
'twas th' purpose iv th' hero to save th' honest girl from the clutches
iv th' villin in time to go out with him an' have a shell iv beer at th'
Dutchman's downstairs. In th' plays nowadays th' hero is more iv a
villain thin th' villain himsilf. He's th' sort iv a man that we used to
heave pavin' shtones at whin he come out iv th' stage dure iv th'
Halsted Sthreet Opry House. To be a hero ye've first got to be an
Englishman, an' as if that wasn't bad enough ye've got to have committed
as many crimes as th' late H. H. Holmes. If he'd been born in England
he'd be a hero. Ye marry a woman who swears an' dhrinks an' bets on th'
races an' ye quarrel with her. Th' r-rest iv th' play is made up iv hard
cracks be all th' char-ack-ters at each others' morals. This is called
repartee be th' learned, an' Hogan. Repartee is where I say: 'Ye stole a
horse' an' ye say: 'But think iv ye'er wife!' In Ar-rchy r-road 'tis
called disordherly conduct. They'se another play on where a man r-runs
off with a woman that's no betther thin she ought to be. He bates her
an' she marries a burglar. Another wan is about a lady that ates dinner
with a German. He bites her an' she hits him with a cabbage. Thin
they'se a play about an English gintleman iv th' old school who thries
to make a girl write a letter f'r him an' if she don't he'll tell on
her. He doesn't tell an' so he's rewarded with th' love iv th' heroine,
an honest English girl out f'r th' money."

"Nobody's marrid in th' modhern play, Hinnissy, an' that's a good thing,
too, f'r annywan that got marrid wud have th' worst iv it. In th' ol'
times th' la-ads that announces what's goin' to happen in the first act,
always promised ye a happy marredge in th' end an' as ivrybody's lookin'
f'r a happy marredge, that held the aujeence. Now ye know that th' hero
with th' wretched past is goin' to elope with th' dhrunken lady an' th'
play is goin' to end with th' couples prettily divorced in th' centher
iv th' stage. 'Tis called real life an' mebbe that's what it is, but f'r
me I don't want to see real life on th' stage. I can see that anny day.
What I want is f'r th' spotless gintleman to saw th' la-ad with th'
cigareet into two-be-fours an' marry th' lady that doesn't dhrink much
while th' aujeence is puttin' on their coats."

"Why don't they play Shakespere any more?" Mr. Hennessy asked.

"I undherstand," said Mr. Dooley, "that they're goin' to dhramatize
Shakespere whin th' dhramatizer gets through with th' 'Report iv th'
Cinsus Department f'r 1899-1900.'"




TROUBLES OF A CANDIDATE


"I wisht th' campaign was over," said Mr. Dooley.

"I wisht it'd begin," said Mr. Hennessy. "I niver knew annything so
dead. They ain't been so much as a black eye give or took in th' ward
an' its less thin two months to th' big day."

"'Twill liven up," said Mr. Dooley, "I begin to see signs iv th' good
times comin' again. 'Twas on'y th' other day me frind Tiddy Rosenfelt
opened th' battle mildly be insinuatin' that all dimmycrats was liars,
horse thieves an' arnychists. 'Tis thrue he apologized f'r that be
explainin' that he didn't mean all dimmycrats but on'y those that
wudden't vote f'r Mack but I think he'll take th' copper off befure
manny weeks. A ladin' dimmycratic rayformer has suggested that Mack
though a good man f'r an idjiot is surrounded be th' vilest scoundhrels
iver seen in public life since th' days iv Joolyus Caesar. Th' Sicrety
iv th' Threeasury has declared, that Mr. Bryan in sayin' that silver is
not convartible be th' terms iv th' Slatthry bankin' law iv 1870, an'
th' sicond clause iv th' threaty iv Gansville, has committed th'
onpard'nable pollytical sin iv so consthructin' th' facts as to open up
th' possibility iv wan not knowin' th' thrue position iv affairs,
misundhersthandin' intirely. If he had him outside he'd call him a liar.
Th' raypublicans have proved that Willum Jennings Bryan is a thraitor be
th' letther written be Dr. Lem Stoggins, th' cillybrated antithought
agytator iv Spooten Duyvil to Aggynaldoo in which he calls upon him to
do nawthin' till he hears fr'm th' doc. Th' letther was sint through th'
postal authorities an' as they have established no post-office in
Aggynaldoo's hat they cudden't deliver it an' they opened it. Upon r-
readin' th' letther Horace Plog iv White Horse, Minnesota, has wrote to
Willum Jennings Bryan declarin' that if he (Plog) iver went to th'
Ph'lippeens, which he wud've done but f'r th' way th' oats was sproutin'
in th' stack, an' had been hit with a bullet he'd ixpict th' Coroner to
hold Bryan to th' gran' jury. This was followed be th' publication iv a
letther fr'm Oscar L. Swub iv East Persepalis, Ohio, declarin' that his
sister heerd a cousin iv th' man that wash'd buggies in a livery stable
in Canton say Mack's hired man tol' him Mack'd be hanged befure he'd
withdraw th' ar-rmy fr'm Cuba."

"Oh, I guess th' campaign is doin' as well as cud be ixpicted. I see be
th' raypublican pa-apers that Andhrew Carnegie has come out f'r Bryan
an' has conthributed wan half iv his income or five hundhred millyon
dollars to th' campaign fund. In th' dimmycratic pa-apers I r-read that
Chairman Jim Jones has inthercipted a letther fr'm the Prince iv Wales
to Mack congratulatin' him on his appintmint as gintleman-in-waitin' to
th' queen. A dillygation iv Mormons has started fr'm dimmycratic
headquarthers to thank Mack f'r his manly stand in favor iv poly-gamy
an' th' raypublican comity has undher con-sideration a letther fr'm long
term criminals advisin' their colleagues at large to vote f'r Willum
Jennings Bryan, th' frind iv crime."

"In a few short weeks, Hinnissy, 'twill not be safe f'r ayether iv
the candydates to come out on th' fr-ront porch till th' waitin'
dillygations has been searched be a polisman. 'Tis th' divvle's own time
th' la-ads that r-runs f'r th' prisidincy has since that ol' boy
Burchard broke loose again' James G. Blaine. Sinitor Jones calls wan iv
his thrusty hinchman to his side, an' says he: 'Mike, put on a pig-tail,
an' a blue shirt an' take a dillygation iv Chinnymen out to Canton an'
congratulate Mack on th' murdher iv mission'ries in China. An',' he
says, 'ye might stop off at Cincinnati on th' way over an' arrange f'r a
McKinley an' Rosenfelt club to ilict th' British Consul its prisidint
an' attack th' office iv th' German newspaper,' he says. Mark Hanna
rings f'r his sicrety an', says he: 'Have ye got off th' letther fr'm
George Fred Willums advisin' Aggynaldoo to pizen th' wells?' 'Yes sir.'
'An' th' secret communication fr'm Bryan found on an arnychist at
Pattherson askin' him to blow up th' White House?' 'It's in th' hands iv
th' tyepwriter.' 'Thin call up an employmint agency an' have a
dillygation iv Jesuites dhrop in at Lincoln, with a message fr'm th'
pope proposin' to bur-rn all Protestant churches th' night befure
iliction.'"

"I tell ye, Hinnissy, th' candydate is kept mov-in'. Whin he sees a
dilly-gation pikin' up th' lawn he must be r-ready. He makes a flyin'
leap f'r th' chairman, seizes him by th' throat an' says: 'I thank ye
f'r th' kind sintimints ye have conveyed. I am, indeed, as ye have
remarked, th' riprisintative iv th' party iv manhood, honor, courage,
liberality an' American thraditions. Take that back to Jimmy Jones an'
tell him to put it in his pipe an' smoke it.' With which he bounds into
th' house an' locks the dure while th' baffled conspirators goes down to
a costumer an' changes their disguise. If th' future prisidint hadn't
been quick on th' dhraw he'd been committed to a policy iv sthranglin'
all the girl babies at birth."

"No,'tis no aisy job bein' a candydate, an' 'twud be no easy job if th'
game iv photygraphs was th' on'y wan th' candydates had to play. Willum
Jennings Bryan is photygraphed smilin' back at his smilin' corn fields,
in a pair iv blue overalls with a scythe in his hand borrid fr'm th'
company that's playin' 'Th' Ol' Homestead,' at th' Lincoln Gran' Opry
House. Th' nex' day Mack is seen mendin' a rustic chair with a monkey
wrinch, Bryan has a pitcher took in th' act iv puttin' on a shirt marked
with th' union label, an' they'se another photygraph iv Mack carryin' a
scuttle iv coal up th' cellar stairs. An' did ye iver notice how much
th' candydates looks alike, an' how much both iv thim looks like Lydia
Pinkham? Thim wondherful boardhin'-house smiles that our gifted leaders
wears, did ye iver see annythin' so entrancin'? Whin th' las'
photygrapher has packed his ar-ms homeward I can see th' gr-reat men
retirin' to their rooms an' lettin' their faces down f'r a few minyits
befure puttin' thim up again in curl-pa-apers f'r th' nex' day display.
Glory be, what a relief 'twill be f'r wan iv thim to raysume permanently
th' savage or fam'ly breakfast face th' mornin' afther iliction! What a
raylief 'twill be to no f'r sure that th' man at th' dure bell is on'y
th' gas collector an' isn't loaded with a speech iv thanks in behalf iv
th' Spanish Gover'mint! What a relief to snarl at wife an' frinds wanst
more, to smoke a seegar with th' thrust magnate that owns th' cider
facthry near th' station, to take ye'er nap in th' afthernoon
undisthurbed be th' chirp iv th' snap-shot! 'Tis th' day afther iliction
I'd like f'r to be a candydate, Hinnissy, no matther how it wint."

"An' what's become iv th' vice-prisidintial candydates?" Mr. Hennessy
asked.

"Well," said Mr. Dooley, "Th' las' I heerd iv Adly, I didn't hear
annythin', an' th' las' I heerd iv Tiddy he'd made application to th'
naytional comity f'r th' use iv Mack as a soundin' board."




A BACHELOR'S LIFE


"It's always been a wondher to me," said Mr. Hennessy, "ye niver
marrid."

"It's been a wondher to manny," Mr. Dooley replied haughtily. "Maybe if
I'd been as aisy pleased as most--an' this is not sayin' annything again
you an' ye'ers, Hinnisy, f'r ye got much th' best iv it--I might be th'
father iv happy childher an' have money in th' bank awaitin' th' day
whin th' intherest on th' morgedge fell due. 'Tis not f'r lack iv
opportunities I'm here alone, I tell ye that me bucko, f'r th' time was
whin th' sound iv me feet'd brings more heads to th' windies iv Ar-rchey
r-road thin'd bob up to see ye'er fun'ral go by. An' that's manny a
wan."

"Ah, well," said Mr. Hennessy, "I was but jokin' ye." His tone mollified
his friend, who went on: "To tell ye th' truth, Hinnissy, th' raison I
niver got marrid was I niver cud pick a choice. I've th' makin' iv an
ixcillint ol' Turk in me, to be sure, f'r I look on all the sect as
iligeable f'r me hand an' I'm on'y resthrained fr'm r-rentin' Lincoln
Park f'r a home an' askin' thim all to clave on'y to me, be me nachral
modesty an' th' laws iv th' State iv Illinye. 'Twas always so with me
an' I think it is so with most men that dies bachelors. Be r-readin' th'
pa-apers ye'd think a bachelor was a man bor-rn with a depraved an'
parvarse hathred iv wan iv our most cherished institootions, an' anti-
expansionist d'ye mind. But'tis no such thing. A bachelor's a man that
wud extind his benificint rule over all th' female wurruld, fr'm th'
snow-capped girls iv Alaska to th' sunny eileens iv th' Passyfic. A
marrid man's a person with a limited affection--a protictionist an'
anti-expansionist, a mugwump, be hivins. 'Tis th' bachelor that's
keepin' alive th' rivrince f'r th' sect.

"Whin I was a young man, ye cud search fr'm wan end iv th' town to th'
other f'r me akel with th' ladies. Ye niver see me in them days, but
'twas me had a rogue's eye an' a leg far beyant th' common r-run iv
props. I cud dance with th' best iv thim, me voice was that sthrong
'twas impossible to hear annywan else whin I sung 'Th' Pretty Maid
Milkin' th' Cow,' an' I was dhressed to kill on Sundahs. 'Twas thin I
bought th' hat ye see me wear at th' picnic. 'Twas 'Good mornin',
Misther Dooley, an' will ye come in an' have a cup iv tay,' an' 'How
d'ye do Misther Dooley, I didn't see ye at mass this mornin',' an'
'Martin, me boy, dhrop in an' take a hand at forty-fives. Th' young
ladies has been ask in' me ar-re ye dead.' I was th' pop'lar idol, ye
might say, an' manny's th' black look I got over th' shouldher at picnic
an' wake. But I minded thim little. If a bull again me come fr'm th'
pope himsilf in thim days whin me heart was high, I'd tuck it in me
pocket an' say: 'I'll r-read it whin I get time.'"

"Well, I'd take one iv th' girls out in me horse an' buggy iv a Sundah
an' I'd think she was th' finest in th' wurruld an' I'd be sayin' all
kinds iv jokin' things to her about marredge licenses bein' marked down
on account iv th' poor demand an' how th' parish priest was thinkin' iv
bein' thransferred to a parish where th' folks was more kindly disposed
to each other an' th' likes iv that, whin out iv th' corner iv me eye
I'd see another girl go by, an' bless me if I cud keep th' lid iv me r-
right eye still or hold me tongue fr'm such unfortchnit remark as: 'That
there Molly Heaney's th' fine girl, th' fine, sthrappin' girl, don't ye
think so?' Well, ye know, afther that I might as well be dhrivin' an ice
wagon as a pleasure rig; more thin wanst I near lost th' tip iv me nose
in th' jamb iv th' dure thryin' to give an affictshionate farewell. An'
so it wint on, till I got th' repytation iv a flirt an' a philandhrer
f'r no raison at all, d'ye mind, but me widespread fondness. I like thim
all, dark an' light, large an' small, young an' old, marrid an' single,
widdied an' divorced, an' so I niver marrid annywan. But ye'll find me
photygraft in some albums an' me bills in more thin wan livery stable."

"I think marrid men gets on th' best f'r they have a home an' fam'ly to
lave in th' mornin' an' a home an' fam'ly to go back to at night; that
makes thim wurruk. Some men's domestic throubles dhrives thim to dhrink,
others to labor. Ye r-read about a man becomin' a millyonaire an' ye
think he done it be his own exertions whin 'tis much again little 'twas
th' fear iv comin' home impty handed an' dislike iv stayin' ar-round th'
house all day that made him rich. Misther Standard Ile takes in millyons
in a year but he might be playin' dominoes in an injine house if it
wasn't f'r Mrs. Standard Ile. 'Tis th' thought iv that dear quiet lady
at home, in her white cap with her ca'm motherly face, waitin' patiently
f'r him with a bell-punch that injooces him to put a shtick iv dinnymite
in somebody else's ile well an' bury his securities whin th' assissor
comes ar-round. Near ivry man's property ought to be in wife's name an'
most iv it is.

"But with a bachelor 'tis diff'rent. Ye an' I ar-re settin' here
together an' Clancy dhrops in. Clancy's wife's away an' he's out f'r a
good time an' he comes to me f'r it. A bachelor's f'r th' enjymint of
his marrid frinds' vacations. Whin Clancy's wife's at home an' I go to
see him he r-runs th' pail out in a valise, an' we take our criminal
dhrink in th' woodshed. Well, th' three iv us sits here an' pass th'
dhrink an' sing our songs iv glee till about ilivin o'clock; thin ye
begin to look over ye'er shouldher ivry time ye hear a woman's voice an'
fin'lly ye get up an' yawn an' dhrink ivrything on th' table an' gallop
home. Clancy an' I raysume our argymint on th' Chinese sityation an'
afterwards we carol together me singin' th' chune an' him doin' a razor
edge tinor. Thin he tells me how much he cares f'r me an' proposes to
rassle me an' weeps to think how bad he threats his wife an' begs me
niver to marry, f'r a bachelor's life's th' on'y wan, an' 'tis past two
o'clock whin I hook him on a frindly polisman an' sind him thrippin'--
th' polisman--down th' sthreet. All r-right so far. But in th' mornin'
another story. If Clancy gets home an' finds his wife's rayturned fr'm
th' seaside or th' stock yards, or whereiver'tis she's spint her
vacation, they'se no r-rest f'r him in th' mornin'. His head may sound
in his ears like a automobill an' th' look iv an egg may make his knees
thremble, but he's got to be off to th' blacksmith shop, an' hiven help
his helper that mornin'. So Clancy's gettin' r-rich an' puttin' a
coopoly on his house."

"But with me 'tis diff'rent. Whin Phibbius Apollo as Hogan calls th'
sun, raises his head above th' gas house, I'm cuddled up in me couch an'
Morpus, gawd iv sleep, has a sthrangle holt on me. Th' alarm clock
begins to go off an' I've just sthrength enough to raise up an' fire it
through th' window. Two hours aftherward I have a gleam iv human
intillygince an' hook me watch out fr'm undher th' pillow. 'It's eight
o'clock,' says I. 'But is it eight in th' mornin' or eight in th'
evenin'?' says I. 'Faith, I dinnaw, an' divvle a bit care I. Eight's
on'y a number,' says I. 'It riprisints nawthin',' says I."

"They'se hours enough in th' day f'r a free man. I'll turr-n over an'
sleep till eight-wan and thin I'll wake up refrished,' I says. 'Tis
ilivin o'clock whin me tired lids part f'r good an' Casey has been here
to pay me eight dollars an' findin' me not up has gone away f'r another
year."

"A marrid man gets th' money, Hinnissy, but a bachelor man gets th'
sleep. Whin all me marrid frinds is off to wurruk pound in' th'
ongrateful sand an' wheelin' th' rebellyous slag, in th' heat iv th'
afthernoon, ye can see ye'er onfortchnit bachelor frind perambulatin' up
an' down th' shady side iv th' sthreet, with an umbrelly over his head
an' a wurrud iv cheer fr'm young an' old to enliven his loneliness."

"But th' childher?" asked Mr. Hennessy slyly.

"Childher!" said Mr. Dooley. "Sure I have th' finest fam'ly in th' city.
Without scandal I'm th' father iv ivry child in Ar-rchey r-road fr'm end
to end."

"An' none iv ye'er own," said Mr. Hennessy.

"I wish to hell, Hinnissy," said Mr. Dooley savagely, "ye'd not lean
against that mirror, I don't want to have to tell ye again."




THE EDUCATION OF THE YOUNG


The troubled Mr. Hennessy had been telling Mr. Dooley about the
difficulty of making a choice of schools for Packy Hennessy, who at the
age of six was at the point where the family must decide his career.

"'Tis a big question," said Mr. Dooley, "an' wan that seems to be
worryin' th' people more thin it used to whin ivry boy was designed f'r
th' priesthood, with a full undherstandin' be his parents that th'
chances was in favor iv a brick yard. Nowadays they talk about th'
edycation iv th' child befure they choose th' name. 'Tis: 'Th' kid talks
in his sleep. 'Tis th' fine lawyer he'll make.' Or, 'Did ye notice him
admirin' that photygraph? He'll be a gr-reat journalist.' Or, 'Look at
him fishin' in Uncle Tim's watch pocket. We must thrain him f'r a
banker.' Or, 'I'm afraid he'll niver be sthrong enough to wurruk. He
must go into th' church.' Befure he's baptized too, d'ye mind. 'Twill
not be long befure th' time comes whin th' soggarth'll christen th'
infant: 'Judge Pathrick Aloysius Hinnissy, iv th' Northern District iv
Illinye,' or 'Profissor P. Aloysius Hinnissy, LL.D., S.T.D., P.G.N., iv
th' faculty iv Nothre Dame.' Th' innocent child in his cradle,
wondherin' what ails th' mist iv him an' where he got such funny lookin'
parents fr'm, has thim to blame that brought him into th' wurruld if he
dayvilops into a sicond story man befure he's twinty-wan an' is took up
be th' polis. Why don't you lade Packy down to th' occylist an' have him
fitted with a pair iv eyeglasses? Why don't ye put goloshes on him, give
him a blue umbrelly an' call him a doctor at wanst an' be done with it?"

"To my mind, Hinnissy, we're wastin' too much time thinkin' iv th'
future iv our young, an' thryin' to larn thim early what they oughtn't
to know till they've growed up. We sind th' childher to school as if
'twas a summer garden where they go to be amused instead iv a
pinitinchry where they're sint f'r th' original sin. Whin I was a la-ad
I was put at me ah-bee abs, th' first day I set fut in th' school behind
th' hedge an' me head was sore inside an' out befure I wint home. Now
th' first thing we larn th' future Mark Hannas an' Jawn D. Gateses iv
our naytion is waltzin', singin', an' cuttin' pitchers out iv a book.
We'd be much betther teachin' thim th' sthrangle hold, f'r that's what
they need in life."

"I know what'll happen. Ye'll sind Packy to what th' Germans call a
Kindygartin, an' 'tis a good thing f'r Germany, because all a German
knows is what some wan tells him, an' his grajation papers is a certy-
ficate that he don't need to think anny more. But we've inthrajooced it
into this counthry, an' whin I was down seein' if I cud injooce
Rafferry, th' Janitor iv th' Isaac Muggs Grammar School, f'r to vote f'r
Riordan--an' he's goin' to--I dhropped in on Cassidy's daughter, Mary
Ellen, an' see her kindygartnin'. Th' childher was settin' ar-round on
th' flure an' some was moldin' dachshunds out iv mud an' wipin' their
hands on their hair, an' some was carvin' figures iv a goat out iv
paste-board an' some was singin' an' some was sleepin' an' a few was
dancin' an' wan la-ad was pullin' another la-ad's hair. 'Why don't ye
take th' coal shovel to that little barbaryan, Mary Ellen?' says I. 'We
don't believe in corporeal punishment,' says she. 'School shud be made
pleasant f'r th' childher,' she says. 'Th' child who's hair is bein'
pulled is larnin' patience,' she says, 'an' th' child that's pullin' th'
hair is discovrin' th' footility iv human indeavor,' says she. 'Well,
oh, well,' says I, 'times has changed since I was a boy,' I says. 'Put
thim through their exercises,' says I. 'Tommy,' says I, 'spell cat,' I
says. 'Go to th' divvle,' says th' cheerub. 'Very smartly answered,'
says Mary Ellen. 'Ye shud not ask thim to spell,' she says. 'They don't
larn that till they get to colledge,' she says, 'an'' she says,
'sometimes not even thin,' she says. 'An' what do they larn?' says I.
'Rompin',' she says, 'an' dancin',' she says, 'an' indepindance iv
speech, an' beauty songs, an' sweet thoughts, an' how to make home home-
like,' she says. 'Well,' says I, 'I didn't take anny iv thim things at
colledge, so ye needn't unblanket thim,' I says. 'I won't put thim
through anny exercise today,' I says. 'But whisper, Mary Ellen,' says I,
'Don't ye niver feel like bastin' th' seeraphims?' 'Th' teachin's iv
Freebull and Pitzotly is conthrary to that,' she says. 'But I'm goin' to
be marrid an' lave th' school on Choosdah, th' twinty-sicond iv
Janooary,' she says, 'an' on Mondah, th' twinty-first, I'm goin' to ask
a few iv th' little darlin's to th' house an',' she says, 'stew thim
over a slow fire,' she says. Mary Ellen is not a German, Hinnissy."

"Well, afther they have larned in school what they ar-re licked f'r
larnin' in th' back yard--that is squashin' mud with their hands--
they're conducted up through a channel iv free an' beautiful thought
till they're r-ready f'r colledge. Mamma packs a few doylies an' tidies
into son's bag, an' some silver to be used in case iv throuble with th'
landlord, an' th' la-ad throts off to th' siminary. If he's not sthrong
enough to look f'r high honors as a middle weight pugilist he goes into
th' thought departmint. Th' prisidint takes him into a Turkish room,
gives him a cigareet an' says: 'Me dear boy, what special branch iv
larnin' wud ye like to have studied f'r ye be our compitint profissors?
We have a chair iv Beauty an' wan iv Puns an' wan iv Pothry on th'
Changin' Hues iv the Settin' Sun, an' wan on Platonic Love, an' wan on
Nonsense Rhymes, an' wan on Sweet Thoughts, an' wan on How Green Grows
th' Grass, an' wan on' th' Relation iv Ice to th' Greek Idee iv God,' he
says. 'This is all ye'll need to equip ye f'r th' perfect life, onless,'
he says, 'ye intind bein' a dintist, in which case,' he says, 'we won't
think much iv ye, but we have a good school where ye can larn that
disgraceful thrade,' he says. An' th' la-ad makes his choice, an' ivry
mornin' whin he's up in time he takes a whiff iv hasheesh an' goes off
to hear Profissor Maryanna tell him that 'if th' dates iv human
knowledge must be rejicted as subjictive, how much more must they be
subjicted as rejictive if, as I think, we keep our thoughts fixed upon
th' inanity iv th' finite in comparison with th' onthinkable truth with
th' ondivided an' onimaginable reality. Boys ar-re ye with me?'"

"That's at wan colledge-Th' Colledge iv Speechless Thought. Thin there's
th' Colledge iv Thoughtless Speech, where th' la-ad is larned that th'
best thing that can happen to annywan is to be prisident iv a railroad
consolidation. Th' head iv this colledge believes in thrainin' young men
f'r th' civic ideel, Father Kelly tells me. Th' on'y thrainin' I know
f'r th' civic ideel is to have an alarm clock in ye'er room on iliction
day. He believes 'young men shud be equipped with Courage, Discipline,
an' Loftiness iv Purpose;' so I suppose Packy, if he wint there, wud
listen to lectures fr'm th' Profissor iv Courage an' Erasmus H. Noddle,
Doctor iv Loftiness iv Purpose. I loft, ye loft, he lofts. I've always
felt we needed some wan to teach our young th' Courage they can't get
walkin' home in th' dark, an' th' loftiness iv purpose that doesn't
start with bein' hungry an' lookin' f'r wurruk. An' in th' colledge
where these studies are taught, its undhershtud that even betther thin
gettin' th' civic ideel is bein' head iv a thrust. Th' on'y trouble with
th' coorse is that whin Packy comes out loaded with loftiness iv
purpose, all th' lofts is full iv men that had to figure it out on th'
farm."

"I don't undherstand a wurrud iv what ye're sayin'," said Mr. Hennesy.

"No more do I," said Mr. Dooley. "But I believe 'tis as Father Kelly
says: 'Childher shudden't be sint to school to larn, but to larn how to
larn. I don't care what ye larn thim so long as 'tis onpleasant to
thim.' 'Tis thrainin' they need, Hinnissy. That's all. I niver cud make
use iv what I larned in colledge about thrigojoomethry an'--an'--
grammar an' th' welts I got on th' skull fr'm the schoolmasther's cane I
have nivver been able to turn to anny account in th' business, but 'twas
th' bein' there and havin' to get things to heart without askin' th'
meanin' iv thim an' goin' to school cold an' comin' home hungry, that
made th' man iv me ye see befure ye."

"That's why th' good woman's throubled about Packy," said Hennessy.

"Go home," said Mr. Dooley.




"L'AIGLON"


"Hogan's been tellin' me iv a new play he r-read th' other day," said
Mr. Dooley. "'Tis be th' same la-ad that wrote th' piece they played
down in th' Christyan Brothers' school last year about the man with th'
big nose, that wud dhraw a soord or a pome on e'er a man alive. This wan
is called 'The Little Eagle,' an' 'tis about th' son iv Napolyon th'
Impror iv th' Fr-rinch, th' first wan, not th' wan I had th' fight about
in Schwartzmeister's in eighteen hundhred an' siventy. Bad cess to that
man, he was no good. I often wondher why I shtud up f'r him whin he had
hardly wan frind in th' counthry. But I did, an' ye might say I'm a
vethran iv th' Napolyonic Wars. I am so.

"But th' first Napolyon was a diff'rent man, an' whin he died he left a
son that th' coorts tur-rned over to th' custody iv his mother, th' ol'
man bein' on th' island--th' same place where Gin'ral Crownjoy is now.
Tis about this la-ad th' play's written. He don't look to be much
account havin' a hackin' cough all through the piece, but down
undherneath he wants to be impror iv th' Fr-rinch like his father befure
him, d'ye mind, on'y he don't dare to go out f'r it f'r fear iv catchin'
a bad cold on his chist. Th' Austhreeches that has charge iv him don't
like th' idee iv havin' him know what kind iv man his father was. Whin
he asks: 'Where's pah?' They say: 'He died in jail.' 'What happened in
1805?' says th' boy. 'In 1805,' says th' Austhreeches, 'th' bar-rn blew
down.' 'In 1806?' says th' boy. 'In 1806 th' chimney smoked.' 'Not so,'
says th' prince. 'In 1806 me father crossed th' Rhine an' up,' he says,
'th' ar-rmed camps he marched to Augaspiel, to Lieberneck, to Donnervet.
He changed his boots at Mikelstraus an' down th' eagle swooped on
Marcobrun,' he says. 'Me gran'dad fled as flees th' hen befure th' hawk,
but dad stayed not till gran'pa, treed, besought f'r peace. That's what
me father done unto me gran'dad in eighteen six.' At this p'int he
coughs but ye sees he knew what was goin' on, bein' taught in secret be
a lady iv th' stage fr'm whom manny a la-ad cud larn th' truth about his
father.

"Still he can't be persuaded f'r to apply f'r th' vacant improrship on
account iv his lungs, till wan day a tailor shows up to measure him f'r
some clothes. Th' tailor d'ye mind is a rivolutionist in disguise, an'
has come down fr'm Paris f'r to injooce th' young man to take th'
vacancy. 'Fourteen, six, thirty-three. How'll ye have th' pants made,
Impror?' says th' tailor. 'Wan or two hip pockets?' says he.

"'Two hips,' says young Napolyon. 'What do ye mean be that"?' he says.

"'Thirty-eight, siventeen, two sides, wan watch, buckle behind. All
Paris awaits ye, sire.'"

"'Make th' sleeves a little longer thin this,' says th' boy. 'An' fill
out th' shouldhers. What proof have I?'"

"'Wan or two inside pockets?' says th' tailor. 'Two insides. Hankerchief
pocket? Wan hankerchief. Th' pants is warn much fuller this year. Make
that twinty-eight instid iv twinty-siven,' he says. 'Paris shrieks f'r
ye,' he says.

"'Proof,' says th' la-ad.

"'They've named a perfume afther ye, a shirt waist, a paper collar, a
five cint seegar, a lot iv childer. Nay more, a breakfast dish
christened f'r ye is on ivry lip. Will I forward th' soot collect?' he
says.

"'No, sind th' bill to me mother,' says th' boy. 'An' meet me in th'
park at tin,' he says.

"So 'tis planned to seize th' throne, but it comes to nawthin'."

"Why's that?" asked Mr. Hennessy.

"F'r th' same reason that the Irish rivolution failed, th' polis stopped
it. Th' con-spirators met in th' park an' were nailed be a park
polisman. They didn't run in th' boy, but left him alone in th' place
which was where his father wanst fought a battle. As he shtands there
coughin' he begins to hear voices iv soops that followed th' ol' Impror.
'Comrade' says wan. 'Give me ye'er hand.' 'I can't,' says another. 'I
haven't wan left.' 'Where's me leg?' 'Sarch me.' 'I've lost me voice.'
'Me mind is shot away.' 'Reach me some wather.' 'Pass th' can.' 'A horse
is settin' on me chest.' 'What's that? They'se a batthry iv artillery on
me.' 'I've broke something. What is it?' 'I cannot move me leg.' 'Curses
on the Cavalry.' 'Have ye got th' time?' 'Oh me knee, how it aches me.'
'Ha ha. Ha ha. Ha ha. Ha ha.' 'Veev, th' Impror.' 'Right about face,
shouldher ar-rms, right shouldher shift arms. March.' A harsh, metallic
voice in the distance: 'Gin-rals, leftnant Gin'rals, officers, sooz-
officers, an' men--.' 'Tis th' boy's father. Th' boy pulls out his soord
an' says he: 'Come on, let's fight. Play away there band. Blow fife and
banners wave. Lave me at thim. Come on, come on!' an' he rushes out an'
makes a stab at an Austhreech regimint that's come up to be dhrilled.
Thin he undherstands 'twas all a dhream with him an' he raysumes his ol'
job. In th' next act he dies."

"That's a good act," said Mr. Hennessy.

"'Tis fine. In Austhree where this happened whin a man dies ivrybody
comes in to see him. Ye meet a frind on th' sthreet an' he says: 'Come
on over an see Harrigan jump off.' So whin th' la-ad is r-ready f'r to
go out ivry body gathers in his room. 'Tis a fash'nable ivint, like th'
Horse Show. Among those prisint is his mother. She's a frivolous ol'
loon, this Marie Louisa, that was Napolyon's sicond wife, though between
you an' me, Father Kelly has niver reconized her as such, th' Impror
havin' a wife livin' that was as tough as they make thim. But annyhow
she was there. She hadn't done much f'r her son, but she come to see him
off with siv'ral ladies that loved him an' others. Bein' a busy an'
fashn'able woman she cudden't raymimber his name. At times she called
him 'Frank' an' thin 'Fronzwah' an' 'Fritz' an' 'Ferdynand'--'twas a
name beginnin' with 'f' she knew that--but he f'rgive her an' ast
somewan to r-read to him. 'What shall it be?' says a gin'ral. 'R-read
about th' time I was christened,' says th' boy. An' th' gin'ral r-reads:
'At iliven o'clock at th' church iv Nothre Dame in th' prisince iv th'
followin' princes--,' 'Cut out th' princes,' says th' la-ad. 'An' kings
--' 'F'rget th' kings,' says th' lad. 'Th' son iv th' Impror--' 'He's
dead,' says th' doctor. 'Put on his white soot,' says th' Main Thing
among th' Austhreeches that was again him fr'm th' beginnin'. An' there
ye ar-re."

"Is that all?" asked Mr. Hennessy.

"That's all," said Mr. Dooley.

"He died?"

"He did."

"But he was sthrong r-right up to th' end."

"He was that. None sthronger."

"An' what?" asked Mr. Hennessy, "did they do with th' soot iv clothes he
ordhered fr'm th' tailor?"

MORIEN

A Metrical Romance rendered into English prose from the Mediaeval Dutch
by Jessie L. Weston, with designs by Caroline Watts. Preface

The metrical romance of which the following pages offer a prose
translation is contained in the mediaeval Dutch version of the
_Lancelot_, where it occupies upwards of five thousand lines, forming
the conclusion of the first existing volume of that compilation. So far
as our present knowledge extends, it is found nowhere else.

Nor do we know the date of the original poem, or the name of the author.
The Dutch MS. is of the commencement of the fourteenth century, and
appears to represent a compilation similar to that with which Sir Thomas
Malory has made us familiar, _i.e._, a condensed rendering of a number
of Arthurian romances which in their original form were independent of
each other. Thus, in the Dutch _Lancelot_ we have not only the latter
portion of the _Lancelot_ proper, the _Queste_, and the _Morte Arthur_,
the ordinary component parts of the prose _Lancelot_ in its most fully
developed form, but also a portion of a _Perceval_ romance, having for
its basis a version near akin to, if not identical with, the poem
of Chretien de Troyes, and a group of episodic romances, some of
considerable length, the majority of which have not yet been discovered
elsewhere. [Footnote: _Cf_. my _Legend of Sir Lancelot du Lac_;
Grimm Library, vol. xii., chapter ix., where a brief summary of the
contents of the Dutch _Lancelot_ is given.]

Unfortunately, the first volume of this compilation, which was
originally in four parts, has been lost; consequently we are without any
of the indications, so often to be found in the opening lines of similar
compositions, as to the personality of the compiler, or the material at
his disposal; but judging from those sections in which comparison is
possible, the _Lancelot_, _Queste_, and _Morte Arthur_, the entire work
is a translation, and a very faithful translation, of a French original.
It is quite clear that the Dutch compiler understood his text well, and
though possibly somewhat hampered by the necessity of turning prose into
verse (this version, contrary to the otherwise invariable rule of the
later _Lancelot_ romances, being rhymed), he renders it with remarkable
fidelity. The natural inference, and that drawn by M. Gaston Paris,
who, so far, appears to be the only scholar who has seriously occupied
himself with this interesting version, is that those episodic romances,
of which we possess no other copy, are also derived from a French
source. Most probably, so far as these shorter romances are concerned,
the originals would be metrical, not prose versions, as in the case of
the _Lancelot_ sections.

It is true that with regard to the romance here translated, _Morien_,
the Dutch scholars responsible for the two editions in which it has
appeared, MM. Jonckbloet and Te Winkel, the former the editor of the
whole compilation, the latter of this section only, are both inclined to
regard the poem as an original Dutch composition; but M. Gaston Paris,
in his summary of the romance (_Histoire Litteraire_, vol. xxx. p. 247)
rejects this theory as based on inadequate grounds. It must be admitted
that an original Arthurian romance of the twelfth or thirteenth century,
when at latest such a poem would be written, in a language other than
French, is so far unknown to us; and although as a matter of fact the
central _motif_ of the poem, the representation of a Moor as near akin
to the Grail Winner, Sir Perceval, has not been preserved in any known
French text, while it does exist in a famous German version, I for one
find no difficulty in believing that the tradition existed in French,
and that the original version of our poem was a metrical romance in that
tongue.

So far as the story of _Morien_ is concerned, the form is probably later
than the tradition it embodies. In its present shape it is certainly
posterior to the appearance of the Galahad _Queste_, to which it
contains several direct references; such are the hermit's allusion to
the predicted circumstances of his death, which are related in full in
the _Queste_; the prophecy that Perceval shall "aid" in the winning
of the Holy Grail, a quest of which in the earlier version he is sole
achiever; and the explicit statements of the closing lines as to
Galahad's arrival at Court, his filling the Siege Perilous, and
achieving the Adventures of the Round Table. As the romance now stands
it is an introduction to the _Queste_, with which volume iii. (volume
ii. of the extant version) of the Dutch _Lancelot_ opens.

But the opening lines of the present version show clearly that in
one important point, at least, the story has undergone a radical
modification. Was it the Dutch translator or his source who substituted
Agloval, Perceval's brother, for the tradition which made Perceval
himself the father of the hero? M. Gaston Paris takes the former view;
but I am inclined to think that the alteration was already in the
French source. The Grail of Sir Agloval's vision is the Grail of Castle
Corbenic and the _Queste_; unless we are to consider this vision as the
addition of the Dutch compiler (who, when we are in a position to test
his work does not interpolate such additions), we must, I think, admit
that the romance in the form in which it reached him was already at a
stage in which Perceval could not, without violence to the then existing
conception of his character, be considered as the father, or the
brother, of Morien. To reconstruct the original story it would be
necessary not merely to eliminate all mention of Agloval, as suggested
by M. Gaston Paris, but the Grail references would also require
modification. As it stands, the poem is a curious mixture of conflicting
traditions.

In this connection it appears to me that the evidence of the _Parzival_
is of primary importance; the circumstances attending the birth of
Feirefis are exactly parallel with those of Morien--in both a Christian
knight wins the love of a Moorish princess; in both he leaves her before
the birth of her son, in the one case with a direct, in the other with
a conditional, promise to return, which promise is in neither instance
kept; in both the lad, when grown to manhood, sets out to seek his
father; in both he apparently makes a practice of fighting with every
one whom he meets; in the one version he is brother, in the other son or
nephew, to Perceval. The points of difference are that whereas Morien is
black all over, save his teeth, Feirefis is parti-coloured, black and
white--a curious conception, which seems to point to an earlier
stage of thought; Morien is a Christian, Feirefis a heathen--the more
probable version.

It is easy to understand why the hero ceased to be considered Perceval's
son--the opening lines of the poem describe the situation perfectly; but
I do not think it has been sufficiently realised that precisely the same
causes which would operate to the suppression of this relationship would
equally operate to the suppression of that of the _Parzival_. Perceval,
the virgin winner of the Grail, could not have a _liaison_ with a
Moorish princess, but neither could Perceval's father, the direct
descendant of Joseph of Arimathea, and hereditary holder of the Grail.
The _Early History_ of that talisman, as related by Robert de Borron,
once generally accepted, the relationship of _brother_ was as impossible
as that of _son_.

It seems clear that if a genuine tradition of a Moor as near kinsman to
Perceval really existed--and I see no reason to doubt that it did--it
must have belonged to the Perceval story prior to the development of
the Grail tradition, _e.g._, to such a stage as that hinted at by the
chess-board adventure of the "Didot" _Perceval_ and Gautier's poem, when
the hero was as ready to take advantage of his _bonnes fortunes_ as
other heroes of popular folk tales.

Further, judging from these stories it would seem probable that the
requisite modification began with the earlier generation, _i.e._,
Perceval himself still retaining traces of his secular and folk-tale
origin, while his father and mother have already been brought under the
influence of the ecclesiasticised Grail tradition. That this would be
the case appears only probable when we recall the vague and conflicting
traditions as to the hero's parentage; it was Perceval himself, and not
his father or his mother, who was the important factor in the tale;
hence the change in his character was a matter of gradual evolution.
Thus I am of opinion that the Moor as Perceval's brother is likely to be
an earlier conception than the Moor as Perceval's son. It is, I think,
noticeable that the romance containing this feature, the _Parzival_,
also, contrary to the _Early History_ versions, connects him with the
Grail through his mother, instead of through his father.

The _Morien_ is for me a welcome piece of evidence in support of the
theory that sees in the poem of Wolfram von Eschenbach the survival of
a genuine variant of the _Perceval_ story, differing in important
particulars from that preserved by Chretien de Troyes, and based upon a
French original, now, unfortunately, lost.

For this, if for no other reason, the poem would, it seems to me, be
worth introducing to a wider circle of readers than that to which in its
present form it can appeal. The students of old Dutch are few in number,
and the bewildering extent of the _Lancelot_ compilation, amounting as
it does, even in its incomplete state, to upwards of 90,000 lines, is
sufficient in itself to deter many from its examination. _Morien_ in its
original form is, and can be, known to but few. But not only does it
represent a tradition curious and interesting in itself, it has other
claims to attention; even in a translation it is by no means ill
written; it is simple, direct, and the adventures are not drawn out
to wearisome length by the introduction of unnecessary details. The
characterisation too, is good; the hero is well realised, and Gawain,
in particular, appears in a most favourable light, one far more in
accordance with the earlier than with the later stage of Arthurian
tradition; the contrast between his courteous self-restraint and the
impetuous ardour of the young savage is well conceived, and the manner
in which he and Gareth contrive to check and manage the turbulent
youth without giving him cause for offence is very cleverly indicated.
Lancelot is a much more shadowy personage; if, as suggested above, the
original story took shape at a period before he had attained to his
full popularity, and references to his valour were added later we can
understand this. It is noticeable that the adventure assigned to him is
much less original in character, and told with far less detail than that
ascribed to Gawain.

The romance as we have it presents, as remarked before, a curious
mixture of earlier and later elements. None of the adventures it relates
are preserved in any English text. Alike as a representative of a lost
tradition, and for its own intrinsic merit it has seemed to me, though
perhaps inferior in literary charm to the romances previously published
in this series, to be yet not unworthy of inclusion among them.

BOURNEMOUTH, _July_ 1901 Morien _Herein doth the adventure tell of a
knight who was named Morien. Some of the books give us to wit that he
was Perceval's son, and some say that he was son to Agloval, who was
Perceval's brother, so that he was nephew unto that good knight. Now we
find it written for a truth that Perceval and Galahad alike died virgin
knights in the quest of the Holy Grail; and for that cause I say of
Perceval that in sooth he was not Morien's father, but that rather was
Morien his brother's son. And of a Moorish princess was he begotten at
that time when Agloval sought far and wide for Lancelot, who was lost,
as ye have read here afore._

_I ween that he who made the tale of Lancelot and set it in rhyme
forgot, and was heedless of, the fair adventure of Morien. I marvel much
that they who were skilled in verse and the making of rhymes did not
bring the story to its rightful ending._ Now as at this time King Arthur
abode in Britain, and held high court, that his fame might wax the
greater; and as the noble folk sat at the board and ate, there came
riding a knight; for 'twas the custom in Arthur's days that while the
king held court no door, small nor great, should be shut, but all men
were free to come and go as they willed.

Thus the knight came riding where the high folk sat, and would fain have
dismounted, but so sorely was he wounded that he might not do so. In
sooth he was in evil case, for he had more than ten wounds, and from the
least of them a man might scarce recover; he came in such guise that his
weapons and his vesture and his steed, which was fair and tall, were
all dyed red with his own blood. The knight was sad at heart and sorely
wounded, yet he greeted, as best he might, all the lords then in the
hall; but more he might not speak, for the pain of his wounds.

Then my lord, Sir Gawain, who did full many a courtesy (for such was his
wont all his life long), so soon as he saw the knight, sprang up with no
delay, and lifted him from the saddle and set him upon the ground, but
he might neither sit, nor walk, nor so much as stand upon his feet, but
fell upon the earth.

Then Sir Gawain bade them carry him softly on a couch to the side of the
hall in the sight of the chief guests, that they might hear his tale.
But since he might scarce speak he made him to be disarmed, and stripped
to the skin, and wrapped in warm coverings and gave him a sop
steeped in clear wine.

Then Sir Gawain began to search his wounds, for in those days, so far
as God suffered the sun to shine might no man find one so skilled in
leech-craft, for that man whom he took in his care, were the life but
left in him, would neither lack healing nor die of any wound.

Then spake the knight who lay there: "Woe is me, for I may neither eat
nor drink; my heart beginneth to sink, mine eyes fail me, methinks I am
about to die! Yet might I live, and would God grant to me that all ye
who sit here beside me might hear my words, I had fain spoken with the
king, whom I sought as best I might, in that I would not be forsworn;
needs must I come hither!"

Then quoth Sir Gawain the good: "Sir Knight, have ye no dread of death
as at this time, for I shall help you to a respite." He drew forth from
his pouch a root that had this virtue, that it stayed the flow of blood
and strengthened the feeble; he placed it in the knight's mouth, and
bade him eat a little; therewith was his heart lightened, and he began
to eat and to drink, and forgat somewhat of his pain.

Erst when the service was ended came King Arthur to the knight as he
lay, and said: "God give ye good-day, dear Sir Knight; tell me who hath
wounded ye so sorely, and how came ye by your hurt? Did the knight who
wrought such harm depart from ye unscathed?"

Then spake the knight to the king, who stood before him: "That will I
tell ye, for I am sworn and pledged thereto. 'Tis seven years past that
I lost all my goods, and poverty pressed me so sorely that I knew not
what I might do. Thus would I keep myself by robbery. My tithes had I
sold, I had spent all my goods, and pledged all my heritage, so that of
all that my father left when he departed from this world there remained
to me nothing. Naught, not a straw, had I left. Yet had I given much in
largesse, for I had frequented many a tourney and Table Round where I
had scattered my goods; whosoever craved aught of me, whether for want
or for reward, were he page, were he messenger, never did he depart
empty-handed. Never did I fail any who besought aid of me. Thus I spent
all my goods. Then must I fare through the land; and did I meet folk
(though at first I shamed me) whomsoever I met, whether pilgrim or
merchant, did he bear goods or money with him, so did I deal with him
that I won it for myself. But little might escape me. I have done many
an evil deed! Now is it three days past since, as I fared on my way, a
knight met me, and I deemed his steed so good that I coveted it above
all things, but when I laid hands upon the bridle and bade the knight
dismount then was he ready with his sword and repaid me with such a blow
that I forgot who I was and all that had befallen me; so fierce was the
stroke he dealt me! And though I betook me to arms they profited me not
a jot; his blows were so heavy, they weighed even as lead. He pierced
through my harness, as ye may see in many places, smiting through flesh
and bone. But from me did he receive no blow that might turn to his
loss. Therefore must I yield myself to him, and swear by my troth, would
I save my life, to come hither to ye as swiftly as I might, and delay no
whit, but yield me your prisoner. And this have I now done, and I yield
myself to your grace, Sir King, avowing my misdeeds that I have wrought
in this world, whether in thought or deed."

Then quoth the king: "Wit ye well who he was, and how he was hight, who
sent ye hither? Of what fashion was his steed, and what tokens did he
bear?"

And the knight answered: "Of that ye would ask me may I tell ye naught,
save only that the knight's steed and armour were red as blood, and he
seemed to me of Wales by his speech, and by all I might discern of him.
Thereto is he of such might that I ween his equal may scarce be found in
Christendom; that may I also say in truth, since such ill chance befell
me that I met with him when my intent was evil, and not good."

Then King Arthur cried aloud that all might hear him, that the knight
was surely none other than Sir Perceval. He tore his hair, and demeaned
himself as one sorely vexed, and spake: "Though I be lord of riches yet
may I say that I am friendless! This may I say forsooth; since I lost
Perceval, and the ill chance befell me that he had the will and the
desire to seek the Grail and the spear (which he may not find) many a
wounded knight hath he sent as captive to my court, whom, for their
misdoing, he hath vanquished by his might. Ever shall he be thanked
therefor. Now have I no knight so valiant of mind that for my sake will
seek Perceval and bring him to court. Yet I and my court and my country
alike are shamed and dishonoured in that we have so long lacked his
presence, and for this am I above measure sorrowful."

Then spake Sir Kay the seneschal: "God-wot I shall fetch Perceval,
whether he will or no, and bring hither to court him whom ye praise so
highly, and believe me well, were he wrought of iron, by the God who
made me I will bring him living or dead! Does this content ye, my lord
king?"

Then stood Arthur and laughed aloud, and likewise did all the knights
who heard Sir Kay speak. And the king said: "Sir Kay, let this talk be;
ye should of right be shamed when ye hear the Welshman's name! Have ye
altogether forgot how ye boasted yourself aforetime, even as ye have now
done, and then how ye met Perceval, whom ye had scarce sought? There
were ye ill-counselled; ye thought to bring him without his will,
but the knight was not so feeble, he gave ye a blow that brake your
collar-bone and thrust ye from your steed, feet upward, with little
honour! Had he so willed he had slain ye. Idle boasting is great shame.
An I hear ye make further boast of seeking knights I shall owe ye small
thanks. Little would he heed your compelling! In such quest must another
ride would I be comforted by the coming of this knight!"

Quoth Sir Gawain, "Ye mind me of an old saying, Sir Kay, how if some men
grow old, and God should spare them even to an hundred years, then would
they be but the more foolish--such an one, methinks, are ye! Now believe
ye my tale; did ye once find Perceval, an ye thought to say to him other
than he chose to hear, by the Lord above us ye dare not do it for the
king's crown, who is lord of this land, he would put ye to such great
shame! Of long time, and full well, do I know his ways! When he is well
entreated, and men do naught to vex him, then is he gentle as a lamb,
but an ye rouse him to wrath then is he the fiercest wight of God's
making--in such wise is he fashioned. Gentle and courteous is he to all
the world, rich and poor, so long as men do him no wrong, but let his
temper be changed, and nowhere shall ye find his fellow!"

After this manner also spake Sir Lancelot, and all who were in the hall
took up the word of Sir Gawain, and praised Perceval. But there were
many in the court heavy at heart, and sore vexed with the king their
lord for that he held them so cheap.

Quoth the Father of Adventure, "By the might of our Lord, and by His
name, who ruleth in heaven, henceforth I will not rest in one place more
than one night or two, but will ride ever till I have found Perceval, or
learnt certain tidings of his doings; and I will bring him to court an
he be minded to ride with me--further will I not vaunt myself."

Then spake Arthur, "God wot, here have I both joy and sorrow. Fain am I
to behold Perceval, an such fortune befall me, and ill may I spare thee.
Thus have I joy and sorrow. Yet, nephew, trow me well, I were loth to
bid thee break thine oath; now, therefore, make ready as befits thee,
and depart as swiftly as may be, and seek me Perceval."

With these words up sprang Sir Lancelot of the Lake, and stepped
forward, and spake, and said he would adventure himself and take what
fortune should send, and go seek Perceval hither and thither through all
lands; "And may I but find that proud knight, an it lieth in my power,
hither will I bring him! Now will I make me ready, and ride hence
without longer tarrying; methinks, from the king's word, an he have
Perceval he shall be freed from care--so will I ride hence for his
honour."

Quoth Arthur the king: "Sir Lancelot, of this thing it behoves ye take
better rede; lightly might it turn to my shame if all my knights rode
forth, and I thereafter were beset with strife and warfare, as full oft
hath chanced aforetime! So might it in sooth be mine undoing. It hath
chanced afore this that I had lost crown and lands, save for my knights;
by them have I been victorious!"

Quoth Sir Lancelot: "By the Lord who made me, and who shall be
Doom's-man at the last day, come what may thereof, since Sir Gawain
rideth hence 'tis not I will bide behind! Rather will I try what may
chance, and adventure all that God hath given me, for he sought me with
all his power when I was in secret case, and brought me once more to
court--for that do I owe him faith and fellowship."

Then they all wept, wives and maidens, knights and squires, when they
knew Sir Lancelot would ride thence.

Sir Gawain, who forgat not the wounded knight and his need of healing,
went to him as he lay, and bound up his wounds, and so tended him at
that time that he was healed ere long--needs must he be healed, even
against his will, on whom Sir Gawain laid hands. All they of the court
were sad and sorry at their departing; that eve they ate but little, for
thinking of the knights who should ride forth with the morning.

But now will we be silent on their lamentations, and tell henceforth of
Sir Gawain and Sir Lancelot, who rode both on their way.

       *       *       *       *       *

The adventure doeth us to wit that in the morning, so soon as it was
day, they rode forth together through many a waste land, over many a
heath and high hill, adown many a valley to seek Sir Perceval, but
little did it profit them, for of him might they learn naught. Thus were
they sorely vexed.

On the ninth day there came riding towards them a knight on a goodly
steed, and well armed withal. He was all black, even as I tell ye: his
head, his body, and his hands were all black, saving only his teeth. His
shield and his armour were even those of a Moor, and black as a raven.
He rode his steed at full gallop, with many a forward bound. When he
beheld the knights, and drew nigh to them, and the one had greeted the
other, he cried aloud to Sir Lancelot: "Knight, now give me to wit of
one thing which I desire, or guard ye against my spear. The truth will I
know. I shall tell ye herewith my custom; what knight soever I may meet,
were he stronger than five men, and I knew it well, yet would I not hold
my hand for fear or favour, but he should answer me, or I should fight
against him. Now, Sir Knight, give me answer, by your troth, so truly as
ye know, to that which I shall ask ye, and delay not, otherwise may ye
well rue it!"

Quoth Sir Lancelot: "I were liefer dead than that a knight should force
me to do that to which I had no mind--so were the shame equal. Hold to
your custom an ye will; I were more fain to fight than to let ye be, if
but to fell your pride. I ask naught but peace, yet will I chastise your
discourtesy, or die in that will!"

The Moor, who was wroth with Sir Lancelot, abode not still, but reined
back his steed, and laid his spear in rest as one who was keen to fight.
Sir Gawain drew on one side, since the twain would fight, and thought in
himself, as was right and courteous, that it were folly, and the custom
of no good knight, for twain to fall on one man, since life stood not at
stake. 'Twere time enough for him to take hand therein, and stand by his
comrade, did he see him hard pressed. Therefore stood Sir Gawain still,
as one who had no mind to fight, nor to break the laws of courtesy.
Nevertheless he deemed that this was a devil rather than a man whom they
had come upon! Had they not heard him call upon God no man had dared
face him, deeming that he was the devil or one of his fellows out of
hell, for that his steed was so great, and he was taller even than Sir
Lancelot, and black withal, as I said afore.

Thus came the two together, the Moor and Sir Lancelot; each had a great
spear and brake it in two, as a reed, yet neither felled the other, but
each abode upon his steed. Then each drew his sword from its sheath, and
set to work therewith, and of a sooth, had not God Himself so willed it
both had died there; so mighty were their strokes that by right no man
should escape alive. Had it been midnight, and dark as night is wont to
be, yet had ye seen the grass and the flowers by the light of the sparks
that flew so thick from helmet and sword and fell upon the earth. The
smith that wrought their weapons I say he wrought them not amiss, he
merited a fairer reward than Arthur ever gave to any man for such
desert.

The knight and Sir Lancelot, neither would yield to the other till Sir
Gawain parted them by his prayer, and made them withdraw each from the
other, for great pity he deemed it should either there be slain; yet so
fell were the blows that they smote, and so great their wrath withal,
that he saw well did the strife endure but short while longer they had
received such wounds as should be the death of one, or it might well be
of both.

When Sir Gawain had parted the twain, whom he saw to be weary enow, he
spake to the Moor: "'Tis an ill custom this to which ye are given; ye
shall here renounce it. Had ye but asked in courteous wise that which ye
have a mind to know, this knight had hearkened, and had answered ye of
right goodwill; he had not refused, that do I know well. Ye be both rash
and foolish, and one of the twain, ye, or he, shall lose by it, and from
that do I dissent, an ye show me not better reason therefore."

Quoth the Moor: "How come ye to speak thus to me? Wot ye that I be
afraid to fight against the twain of ye; or that I have held my hand
through fear of death? Were the one of ye Sir Lancelot, and the other
King Arthur's sister's son (these twain are wont to be praised above all
in Arthur's court as I have ofttimes heard, though never have I seen
them), yet would I not yield a foot to them!"

Then thought Sir Gawain with himself, "We were foolish and unwise an we
failed to show courtesy to one who praises us so highly."

But Sir Lancelot had great lust either to win the fight or to play it to
a loss, and Sir Gawain, who was well ware of this, prayed him straitly,
by the love he bare to him, and to King Arthur his lord, that for their
honour he should hold his peace awhile, and let him say his will: "And
this I charge ye, by the faith ye owe to my lady, my uncle's wife."

Sir Lancelot spake: "Of a sooth, an ye had not thus charged me I should
have avenged myself or here been slain, in that this knight forced the
strife upon me without cause, and loaded me with blows; but in that ye
so conjure me, I am he that will harm no man for profit to myself save
that he first attack me. And since it seemeth good to ye I will e'en lay
the strife in respite. God grant me good counsel therein, since I do it
not for cowardice, but for love of ye and for your prayer."

Thus stood the three in the open, and Sir Gawain spake to the Moor: "Ye
be foolish in that ye do such things--now, neither we nor ye are harmed,
yet might ye lightly do that which should cost ye your life. Tell me
what ye seek, and I will give ye good counsel withal. If I may I shall
tell ye that which ye should courteously have asked of this knight, who
never yet was so hardly bestead by any man that he fell from his steed."

Quoth the Moor: "Ye say well. Now I pray ye by all who own the laws of
knighthood, and by Sir Gawain afore all, since he is reckoned the best,
he and Sir Lancelot, wherever it may be, in whatever need, far and wide
throughout the world, of all men are these twain most praised (I myself
know naught save that which I have heard tell), know ye aught of Sir
Agloval, brother to Sir Perceval of Wales? Of him have I asked many,
this long while past; I have ridden hither and thither this half year,
and here and there have I sought him. For this have I dared many
a peril, and here will I lie dead save that ye twain tell me, in
friendship or in fight, if ye know aught of Sir Agloval. Now have we had
enow of this talk; 'tis full time ye answer, or we take up our strife
once again, and see the which of us hath the sooner his full."

Sir Gawain hearkened, and smiled at the black knight's speech, and spake
soothfastly: "Now tell me what ye will of Sir Agloval that ye thus seek
him, and thereafter will I tell ye that which I know."

And the Moor answered straightway: "So will I tell ye all. Sir Agloval
is my father, 'twas he begat me. And more will I tell ye; it chanced
aforetime as ye may now learn, when he came into the land of the Moors;
there through his valiant deeds he won the heart of a maiden, she was my
mother, by my troth. So far went the matter between them through their
words and through his courtesy, and because he was so fair to look upon,
that she gave him all his will--the which brought her small reward, and
great sorrow. Each plighted their troth to the other ere she granted
him her favours. Therein was she ill-counselled, for he forsook her
thereafter--'tis more than fourteen years past; and when he parted from
her she bare me, though he knew it not. He told her his quest, whereof
he was sore troubled, and how it came about that he must needs leave
her, and that will I now tell ye. My father was seeking a noble knight,
who was lost as at that time, and who was hight Sir Lancelot. Still more
may I tell ye; he told my mother that he and many of his fellows had
sworn a great oath to seek Sir Lancelot, and their quest should endure
two years or more an they found him not, or could learn no tidings of
him. Nor should they tarry in any land more than one night or two. This
vexed my father sorely, that for this cause, and to keep his oath, he
must needs leave my mother. But ere he departed he sware to her that he
would return when he had achieved his quest; but he kept not his oath.
Thus have I sought him in many a court. All this did my lady mother tell
me, and also of the troth-plight. Little good hath it done me that he be
my father, and that he sware to my mother, ere he departed, that for her
honour, and for her profit, he would return to her without fail. Doth he
live, God send him mocking (this I pray in all humility), but an he be
already dead, then may God forgive him his sins. I and my mother are
disinherited, since that he hath deserted us, of great goods and of
a fair heritage, that which fell to her from her father have we lost
altogether. It hath been denied us by the law of the land. Thereto was I
greatly shamed, for they called me fatherless, and I could shew naught
against it, nor tell them who it was that begat me, since my father had
thus fled. So did I cause myself to be dubbed knight, and sware a great
oath (I were loth to break it) that never should I meet a knight but I
would fight him, or he should tell me if he perchance knew any tidings
of my father, that I might learn somewhat concerning him. Did I meet
mine own brother, I would not break mine oath, nor my vow; and till now
have I kept it well, nor broken it by my default. And here would I bid
ye twain, if ye would part from me in friendship, that ye tell me what
ye may know thereof, out and out, by your troth, and therewith end this
talk. Otherwise let us end this matter even as we began it, for there
liveth no knight under the sun for whom I would break mine oath, were it
for my hurt, or for my profit."

Then was there neither of the twain, Sir Gawain nor Sir Lancelot, but
the tears fell from their eyes when they heard the knight's tale. Such
pity had they for him, they waxed pale, and red, and discovered their
faces, when they heard his plaint.

Quoth Sir Lancelot: "By my good days, nevermore will I be wrathful, nor
bear rancour against ye for any lack of courtesy; ye need no longer
stand on guard against me, my heart is not evil towards ye, and we will
counsel ye well."

Then was the black knight blithe, and drew near to Sir Lancelot, and
bared his head, which was black as pitch; that was the fashion of his
land--Moors are black as burnt brands. But in all that men would praise
in a knight was he fair; after his kind. Though he were black, what was
he the worse? In him was naught unsightly; he was taller by half a foot
than any knight who stood beside him, and as yet was he scarce more than
a child! It pleased him so well when he heard them speak thus of Sir
Agloval that he knelt him straightway on the earth; but Sir Gawain
raised him up, and told him their tidings, how they were but as
messengers, and belonged to the court of King Arthur, which was of high
renown, and that they rode at that time seeking Sir Perceval and Sir
Agloval, since the king desired them both. "And his mind is to see and
speak with them; may we by any means persuade those noble knights we
shall return straightway to the king's court, an it be so that they will
ride with us (further will we not vaunt ourselves, 'tis of our good
will, and their pleasure), thereby shall the king be the more honoured.
They belong to the Round Table, and have done so of long time; both are
of the king's court, and knights of high renown. Now an ye will work
wisely, and shun your own harm, ye will mount, and ride to King Arthur's
court, and delay not. I hope in God that Sir Agloval shall come thither
within short space, or that ye shall hear tidings of him; for there come
full oft tidings from afar. Go ye to court without tarrying, the king
will receive ye well. Tell him, and give him to wit who ye be, and
whence ye come, and the quest upon which ye ride; he will not let ye
depart ere we come and bring with us your father, an God prosper us.
Should ye ride thus through the land, and fight with every knight whom
ye may meet, ye will need great good fortune to win every conflict
without mischance or ill-hap! They who will be ever fighting, and ne'er
avoid a combat, an they hold such custom for long, though at whiles they
escape, yet shall they find their master, who will perforce change their
mood! Now Sir Knight do our bidding, for your own honour's sake, and
ride ye to court; grant us this grace, for ere ye have abode long time
there I hope that ye shall behold your father or receive tidings of him.
But till that time abide ye at the court, there shall ye be well at ease
in many ways. Now promise us this; we shall seek your father, and may we
find him, and God give us honour in our quest, then will we return as
swiftly as may be, and rejoice ye and the king!"

When the Moor heard these words he laughed with heart and mouth (his
teeth were white as chalk, otherwise was he altogether black), and he
spake, "God our Father reward ye, noble knights, for the good will and
the honour ye have done me, and also for the great comfort wherewith ye
have lightened mine heart that long hath been all too heavy. An my steed
fail me not I shall ride whither ye bid me to this king whom ye praise
so highly."

With that he pledged to the knights hand and knighthood, and called
God to witness that he would do their bidding, faithfully, and without
dispute, so long as he might live.

Then quoth Sir Lancelot: "Knight, an ye be in any need, when ye come
into Arthur's land,--I ween 'tis all unknown to ye,--speak but of
us twain whom ye see here and men shall do ye naught but honour and
courtesy, where'er ye come, in any place. And when ye come to the king,
ere ye tell him aught beside, say that ye have seen and have spoken with
us; and trow me, without fail, ye shall be well received!" The Moor
spake: "'Tis well said--God reward ye for this courtesy; but were it
your will and pleasing to ye that I knew the names of ye two then
i'sooth were I the blither withal!"

Then straightway Sir Gawain did him to wit who they were, and how they
were hight; and the Moor made no delay, but fell on his knees before
them. Sir Gawain raised him up, but the Moor laid his hands together and
spake, "God the Father of all, and Ruler of the World, grant that I may
amend my misdoing to your honour. Sir Lancelot, very dear lord, I own
myself right guilty, for I did evil, and naught else!"

Sir Gawain spake: "Take ye not to heart that which has here chanced, it
shall be naught the worse for ye."

Sir Gawain and Sir Lancelot were both mounted upon their steeds. The
Moor spake: "'Tis labour lost. Such good knights as ye be, since ye at
this time fare to seek my father, by the power of our Lord I will not
stay behind; 'twere shame an I did. I shall ride with ye twain!"

Quoth Sir Gawain: "Then must ye lay aside all outrageousness, and ride
peaceably on your way, and whatever knight shall meet ye, and greet ye
courteously, him shall ye greet and let pass on his way without strife
or contention; and be his friend an he hath done ye no wrong--this do
I counsel ye straitly. But he that is fierce and fell towards ye or
towards another, on him shall ye prove your prowess, and humble his
pride, if ye may. And honour all women, and keep them from shame, first
and last, as best ye may. Be courteous and of gentle bearing to all ye
meet who be well-mannered toward ye, and he who hath no love for virtue
against him spare neither sword, nor spear, nor shield!"

The Moor spake: "Since that ye will it so, I will at your bidding
forbear, otherwise might I rue it! May God be gracious to me."

So rode they all three together till they came to a parting of the ways
where stood a fair cross, and thereon letters red as blood. Sir Gawain
was learned in clerkly lore, he read the letters wherein was writ that
here was the border of Arthur's land, and let any man who came to the
cross, and who bare the name of knight, bethink him well, since he
might not ride far without strife and conflict, and the finding of such
adventures as might lightly turn to his harm, or even to his death--the
land was of such customs.

This did Sir Gawain tell to the twain. Then they saw, by the parting of
the ways, a hermit's cell, fairly builded, and the knights bethought
them that they would turn them thither that they might hear and see, and
know what the words boded.

There saw they the hermit, who seemed to them a right good man; and they
dismounted at his little window, and asked his tidings, if perchance a
knight in red armour had passed that way? And the good man answered and
said 'twas but the other day, afore noon, that he had seen two knights
who were wondrous like unto each other. "Of a truth it seemed to me,
by their features and by their gestures, that they should be brothers.
Their steeds seemed beyond measure weary. They came that self-same road
that cometh from that land that men here call Britain; they were both in
seeming men of might, and the one had steed and armour that were even
red as blood. They dismounted, both of them, at the foot of that cross
ye see there. There many a judgment is given. There did a knight lose
his life, he and his wife with him; well did they deserve that their
memory should be held in honour by the friends of our Lord, for they
made a right good ending! They had sought the shrine of a saint, with
them they had money and steeds, beside other goods, as befitted folk of
high degree. Here did they fall in with a company of robbers, who slew
the good knight, and took his steed and his money, and all that he had.
Of this was his wife so sorrowful that for grief and woe her heart
brake, and so did they die here, the twain of them, even at the cross
roads, where ye see the fair cross, where now many a judgment is spoken.
'Twas made through the knight's will. Hither come folk stripped and
bare-foot, doing penance for their sins; and they who pass ahorse or
afoot have here had many a prayer granted. The knights of whom ye ask
did there their orisons, as well became them, but I may not tell ye
whither they went at their departing; in sooth I know naught, for I said
my prayers here within and forgat them. But they were tall and strong,
and the one wore red armour, and the other bare the badge of King
Arthur."

Then were the knights sorely grieved, and kindled as a coal for sorrow,
in that they might not know, by any craft, whitherward they rode. Then
they asked the manner of the land, and whither led the roads which they
saw before them.

Then answered the good hermit, "I will tell ye as best I may. The road
by which ye came, that do ye know; and the road that runneth straight
therefrom that will ye shun, an ye heed my counsel. 'Tis a land of
ill-fame, where men follow evil customs; their best, 'tis but others'
worst! He who will keep his horse, his weapons and his life will shun
that road. And the right-hand way goeth to a wild waste land, wherein no
man dwelleth; an I bethink me well 'tis over a year and a day since
I saw man or woman come from thence. An it so befall that ye fare
thitherward ye shall find such a marvel that would ye dare the venture,
and amend the wrong it shall cost ye life and limb, that do I tell ye
here. For there shall ye find the most fell beast ever man heard or read
of; take ye good heed thereof, 'tis the Foul Fiend himself, that know I
well, that roameth in the guise of a beast. Against him may no weapon
serve, there was never spear so sharp nor sword so well tempered, as I
know of a truth, that may harm that devil, but it will break or bend as
hath full oft been proven in time past. Now hath the beast chosen his
dwelling in a little forest, there will he abide all night, but the day
he prowleth by straight and winding ways. He devoureth man and beast
alike, nor may I tell ye the marvels I have heard concerning him. He
hath laid waste a broad land, and driven thereout all the country-folk,
so that none remain. Now have I told ye the truth concerning these two
roads, and what may befall ye therein; for the third, it leadeth hereby
to the sea coast; I know not what I may say more."

Quoth Sir Lancelot: "By the Lord who made me, Sir Gawain, we must needs
depart from each other here and now, would we find these knights. And
I will dare that which I deem the most perilous venture. Ye shall ride
straightway whichever road ye will, otherwise shall we lose the knights
who were lately here, they shall not have ridden far as yet. And if it
be that ye find them, then I charge and conjure ye, by my will and your
valour, that if ye may, ye shall bring them with ye and return hither to
this place. Do this, Sir Knight, for my prayer. And do the hermit to wit
how matters have gone with ye, that he may tell me the truth thereof if
peradventure I too come hither, and the knight shall go with ye, and God
keep ye both since we be now come to this point. Do him honour as a good
man and true, in whatsoever place ye may be, this I pray ye of your
valour."

Sir Gawain gave him answer: "Dear comrade, I am fain to do your bidding,
and may God keep us in life and limb, and in worldly honour. Now choose
ye first which road ye will take, for here will we abide no longer."

Then said Sir Lancelot: "I ween that 'tis the most pressing need to go
fight against the beast whereof the good man telleth us; methinks 'twere
well that I ride thither."

And the hermit answered: "Alas, Sir Knight, ye be so fair that I deem
below the throne one might scarce find your equal, and will ye brave a
venture which no man may achieve! The folk hath fled out of the land,
none may withstand that beast, no shaft is so fell as the venom which
he shooteth on all who near him; and the man whom it reacheth, and upon
whom it shall light (I am he who lieth not), he dieth ere the third day
be past, had he never a wound upon him. This hath been the worse for
many. Then is the beast greater than a horse, and runneth more swiftly
than any horse may. Ye are wise an ye shun the fiend. This do I tell ye
beforehand. Had he not chosen his lair, and did he wander from the land,
as well might be, by the Lord who made us he had laid the world waste!
Ye would do well to turn back."

But 'twas labour lost; not for all the riches that belonged to King
Arthur would he have taken back his word and his covenant, for any
prayer that might be made him, nor have yielded aught through fear.

Then would the knights take leave of each other that they might depart.
The Moor spake to the twain: "For what do ye take me? Am I a lesser or a
weaker man than either of ye that Sir Gawain must needs ride with me?
I will not have it so. There is no knight so bold but I dare well
withstand him. I know well what is unfitting. Now say whither ye will
betake ye, and send me what road ye will; I will dare the venture, be it
never so perilous. By my knighthood, and by all who follow Christendom,
I shall adventure alone, and take that which may chance."

Then said Sir Gawain: "It liketh me ill that ye sware such an oath, yet
since such is your will, take ye the road that leadeth to the sea (this
seemeth to me the best), ride swiftly and spare not, but seek your
father. And do in all things after my counsel; if any man meet ye, when
ye have given him courteous greeting, ask him if he saw riding, or
otherwise met with, two knights, the one of whom ware red armour, and
the other bare King Arthur's badge. This shall ye first beseech of them.
When ye come to the crossing, pray that men tell ye the truth, and
ask for the sea-coast withal, wherever ye come. And if so be that men
understand ye not then return straightway to this place, and follow the
road which I shall take, swiftly, and with no delay. We might lightly
depart so far from each other that we met not again. But follow me soon,
and not too late; and do according as I counsel ye, and I tell ye truly,
no harm shall befall ye."

The Moor spake: "God reward ye." Then took they leave each of the other,
and departed asunder. Now will I tell ye how it fared with Sir Gawain.

The adventure telleth us forthwith that when prime was now already past
Sir Gawain came to a wide and deep river. 'Twas a great stream, and
deep, and the current ran swift and strong. Then Sir Gawain marked well,
and took heed, how on the further side, in a land of which he knew
naught, there came a knight riding on a fair steed, and armed as if for
combat. Before him he drave captive a maiden. Sir Gawain beheld how
he smote her, many a time and oft, blow upon blow, with his fist that
weighed heavily for the mailed gauntlet that he ware. Pain enough did he
make her bear for that she desired not to ride with him. He smote her
many a time and oft with his shield as he would revenge himself upon her
in unseemly fashion. The maiden ware a robe of green silk, that was rent
in many places, 'twas the cruel knight had wrought the mischief. She
rode a sorry hack, bare backed, and her matchless hair, which was yellow
as silk, hung even to the horse's croup--but in sooth she had lost well
nigh the half thereof, which that fell knight had afore torn out. 'Twas
past belief, the maiden's sorrow and shame; how she scarce might bear to
be smitten by the cruel knight; she wept and wrung her hands.

This Sir Gawain beheld, and he deemed 'twere shame an he avenged not her
wrong. He looked before and behind and saw no bridge, great or small, by
which he might cross over, nor saw he living soul of whom he might ask,
then did he delay no longer, but turned his bridle, and set his horse
toward the river bank; he struck his spurs sharply and sprang into the
midst of the stream. The good steed breasted the current, swimming as
best it might and brought its master to the further side. 'Twas great
marvel that they were not drowned, horse and man, for the river was
deep, and the stream ran swiftly.

When Sir Gawain came to the other side of the river, which was both wide
and deep, then saw he a great company of folk riding after the knight
who bare away the maiden by force, and thus misused her, but he wist not
if it was to aid the knight that they thus followed him, or to wreak
vengeance on him. He saw many men clad in hauberks, but they were as yet
a good mile distant. Sir Gawain rode swiftly after the maiden who went
afore, whom the knight thus mishandled, to avenge her wrong; and as he
drew near so that she might see him, she smote her hands together more
than before, and cried to Gawain, "Noble knight, for the honour of
womanhood, save me! This knight doeth me undeserved shame. Did there
come hither any friend of God who would help me in this my need, an he
had slain his own father it should be forgiven him!"

Her prayers and entreaties, her tears and lamentations, would have
stirred any man to pity; she cried upon Sir Gawain as he came riding
into the plain, to come to her aid and fell the knight's pride. As Sir
Gawain heard her his heart was rent with sorrow and compassion and he
spake to that evil knight: "Sir Knight, 'tis folly and discourtesy that
which ye do to this maiden; were ye wise ye would forbear; even had the
maiden wronged ye, ye should deal courteously; he hath small honour who
thus smiteth a maiden."

Then said the cruel knight: "For ye, fool and meddler, whether ye be
knight or no, will I not stay my hand, nay, rather for your shame, will
I chastise her the more; and should ye but speak another word to her I
shall thrust ye straightway from your steed with my spear!"

Quoth Sir Gawain: "Then were I but afoot Sir Knight! Natheless I
counsel ye, an ye be wise, that ye spare the maiden. Ye will find me not
so craven this day as to let ye harm her; I shall defend her and avenge
her wrong if my life be risked upon it. But, Sir Knight, hearken to my
prayer, for God and for your honour, and the sake of knighthood!"

But that evil knight answered and said he would in no wise do this: "An
ye get not hence, and fly, by heaven it shall be your doomsday! I have
no need of your sermons."

Quoth Sir Gawain: "An ye be so bold, lay but your hand again upon her,
and I shall take so stern a pledge as, wist ye, shall dismay your heart,
an it cost me my life. Let the maiden go in peace, or be on your guard
against my spear, for I defy ye!"

The other was high and scornful that Sir Gawain so threatened him. He
thought to quell his pride, and rode against him straightway, and Sir
Gawain, on his side, did even the same. They came together so keenly
that both spears brake, and the crash might be heard afar; they came
together so swiftly that the knight was thrust from his saddle, and fell
to the ground, and he fell so heavily that he felt the smart in every
limb, and lay in anguish from the fall--so stayed he prone upon the
ground.

Sir Gawain took the horse whereon the knight had ridden. He forgat not
his courtesy, but gave it into the hand of the maiden, and drew forth
his good sword. Therewith was the knight come to himself, and had taken
his sword, and stood up as best he might. Evil was his thought, and
he cried: "Vassal, how were ye so bold as to do me this hurt and this
shame? My father is lord of this land, and after him shall it be mine.
Think not to escape, 'tis folly that which ye do. Even to day shall ye
be repaid by those who follow me, and chastised in such wise as ye would
not have for all the riches King Arthur holds or ne'er may hold! My men
will be here anon and ye shall not escape, for in this land hath no man
power or might to withstand me."

Sir Gawain spake: "That may I well believe, and therefore are ye so
cruel and so outrageous. That one who is noble of birth, and rich
withal, should be false of heart, by my troth, 'tis great pity and
bringeth many to shame. Now ye are not yet at such a pass but that I may
teach ye moderation ere ye part from me. Methinks that to-day ye shall
rue the evil ye have done. I counsel ye, an ye be wise, that ye make
known to me wherein this lady hath wronged ye. Hath she indeed deserved
that ye be thus cruel, then 'tis a matter 'twixt ye twain, I meddle no
further. But hath the maiden not deserved this, then hold your hand,
and make peace with me, otherwise is your life forfeit were ye never so
highly born. I take the maiden with me when I ride hence." The knight
would not hearken, and the maiden spake: "Noble knight I will tell ye
wherefore he doeth me this wrong. He would have me for his love, why
should I deny the truth? 'Tis many a day since he first spake to me, but
I would not hearken to him, other sorrows vexed me; poverty grieveth me
sore; thereto have I griefs that I may not lightly tell. My father was a
knight, and a good man, and of high birth in this land. Dear Sir Knight,
I will tell thee openly, though it be shame. My father hath lain sick,
seven year long, and hath lost his goods, and now lieth in sore straits;
he may neither ride nor walk nor stand upon his feet, he suffereth much.
Now have I nursed and tended and otherwise served my father--friends
hath he few save myself, and I had fain stayed by him and kept him all
my life, doing for him all that within me lay. To-day came this knight
within our hold, which is sore broken down and ruined, and hath done me
sore wrong. He took me thence by force, ere I was well aware, nor stayed
his hand for God or man. Thus did he carry me away, and now he doeth
me this shame. He hath left his folk behind that they may hinder my
friends, lest they follow him to his hurt. I fear lest they be here
anon. And should they find ye here ye may scarce escape. Would ye save
your life, then, Sir Knight, make a swift end of this combat. I fear it
dureth over long an ye will aid me, by our Lord's grace. So bethink ye,
Sir Knight, what ye may do."

Quoth Sir Gawain: "An ye be wise, Sir Knight, ye will now speak; here
will I tarry no longer. Will ye right this maiden of the wrong ye have
done her, or fight with me? The one or the other must ye do. An ye will,
I will alight and meet ye afoot, or ye may mount your steed again, by
covenant that ye flee not, nor escape, but abide your fortune."

The knight made answer: "Now do ye hold me over feeble, an ye think I
shall thus yield. Ye will do well to dismount straightway, an ye have
lust to fight." He covered himself with his shield, and drew forth his
sword from the scabbard. Sir Gawain dismounted, whether he liked it well
or ill, and let his horse that men call the Gringalet, stand beside him;
never a foot would that steed stir till its lord came, and once more
laid hand on it. Forthwith they betook them to fight, and dealt each
other fierce thrusts, with mighty and strong strokes, so that one saw
their blood stream out through the mails of their hauberk, and the
sparks sprang out when the helmets were smitten till they seemed to glow
even as doth hot iron when it be thrust into the furnace, and waxeth red
from the fire; so fierce were the blows which each dealt to the other.
That which most sorely vexed Sir Gawain was that his sword scarce seemed
worth a groat, the knight's armour was so good that Sir Gawain's weapon
was stayed upon it. Though one saw the blood well through, yet had the
hauberk never a score. This Sir Gawain deemed a great marvel. He fetched
a mighty blow upward and smote the knight above the hauberk, in the
neck, to the very middle of the throat. Therewith was the matter ended
for him; his head fell forward upon his breast, and he fell dead beneath
the blow.

His friends and kinsmen had beheld from afar and came therewith, sore
distressed and very wrath when they saw their lord thus lying dead upon
the field. Sir Gawain, the good and the valiant, was once more mounted
upon Gringalet. There might he fear no foe; the steed was so strong and
so great, and even as his lord had need would the horse watch and follow
every sign that he might give.

Those who had come thither, and had, as it were, found Sir Gawain in the
very act of slaying, were of one mind that they should beset him, behind
and afore, on horse and afoot, and if it might be take his life. And Sir
Gawain who saw that he was sore bestead, commended himself to the grace
of God with a good heart and received his foes with drawn sword. With
each blow that he smote he wounded one, or two, and wrought them much
harm. None might withstand him, and he that wrought the most valiantly
he abode there dead, or went hence so sorely wounded that he might never
more find healing. Thus Gawain, the Father of Adventure, so daunted them
with the blows that he smote that many drew aside and turned from the
strife with deep wounds and wide. 'Twas a good cause for which Sir
Gawain fought, and for which he desired vengeance, and for that did it
fall to his profit. He brought many of them in sore stress, some of
life, some of limb. With that there came riding a company of the
maiden's folk, who were fain to avenge her shame. So soon as she beheld
them, and they drew nigh, was she glad and blithe and drew aside from
the strife where Sir Gawain did right manfully. The maiden turned to her
own folk, and betook her with that company again to her father. They
were right joyful that she was once more in their power, and they left
Sir Gawain on the field where he was sore bestead--they durst not take
part with him against their overlord, so greatly did they fear his kin.

But Sir Gawain, who marked this not, went smiting blow after blow on
all that came nigh him, and so blinded and drave them backward with his
strokes that he was left alone on the field. So weary and so weak were
they that they lay all along the road, discomfited, prone on the earth,
as those who have sore need of rest. But few of them were whole, for Sir
Gawain had so wounded them that men may well tell the tale from now even
unto Doomsday!

Then thought Sir Gawain within himself, since he had so long wielded his
weapons and no man durst withstand him further he might find no better
counsel than to fare on his way. He thanked God of true heart that he
had thus won honour on this evil folk, and that he had escaped with his
life, and free from mortal wound, he and his steed, and that God had
thus protected them. Men say oft, and 'tis true, as was here well
proven, that he who recks not of his ways, but doeth that which is
displeasing alike to God and to the world, he was born in an evil hour.

Now when Sir Gawain had won the fight, and God had shown him favour by
granting him good knighthood and the discomfiting of his foes, the day
was well past nones, and Sir Gawain, the bold, had neither eaten nor
drunk, nor done aught save fight that day and receive great blows. He
rode on his way sore perplexed and unknowing where he might seek for
lodging. So long did he ride that he was ware how it drew towards
evening, and therewith did he behold a castle. Never was a man more
oppressed with hunger and thirst and weariness; and he thought in his
heart that he could do naught better than ride thither, and see if by
hap he might find lodging for the night.

He found by the castle moat the lord of that burg and many of his
folk with him; when he had dismounted on the turf he greeted them
courteously, and the lord answered "God reward ye."

Quoth Sir Gawain, "Were it your command, and your will and pleasure,
right gladly would I abide here within this night! I know not otherwise
how I may win shelter. I have ridden all this day, and have seen naught
save wilderness and waste land, and there found I no man with whom I
might abide the night."

And the host spake, "So may good befall me in soul and body as I shall
give to you in friendship, even to the uttermost, all that belongeth
unto this even; lodging will I give ye, and food, ham and venison. My
lodging is ever free, and ne'er refused to any knight who would fain be
my guest. He hath safe conduct, good and sure, against all whom he may
meet in this land, were it against mine own son, whom I love above all
who own the laws of knighthood. My safe conduct is so well assured that
whosoe'er should wrong my guest it should cost him his life and all that
he had, had he not more than good fortune! This on my knighthood and by
the Blessed Maid, Our Lady!"

But Sir Gawain, the Father of Adventure, who was wont to be received
with honour, wist not that the knight whom he had slain was son to the
lord of the castle. Now first shall ye hear of marvellous adventures
whereof some be good and some evil.

Sir Gawain had come to that point that he deemed he was well assured of
shelter for the night, nor was he on guard against his heavy mischance.
The host, who would do his guest all honour, took the knight by the
hand, and led him through three portals into a fair hall where he was
received with courteous words. They disarmed him straightway, and
stabled his steed right well. The host bade them take in ward Sir
Gawain's armour and his sword; too far did they carry them! For that was
he vexed and wrathful, and he would not it had so chanced for all his
host's halls, were they of wroughten gold! For as they sat at table
and ate and drank and had enow of all the earth might bear for the
sustenance of man, and forgat thereby all sorrow, they heard sore
wailing and lamentation, and the smiting together of hands, and knew not
what it might mean. They heard folk who stood without the walls, at the
master gate, who cried with loud voice, "Alas, alas! Undo and let us in!"

Then Sir Gawain's mood was changed, and his heart forbade him that
sorrow and mischief drew near. He changed colour and grew red. The
lord gave command from within that they should ask what company stood
without, and what tidings they bare. Then they sprang to the gate, and
opened it, even as their lord bade.

Then came they in, who stood without, bearing a bier, and making so
great cry and lamentation that men heard it far and near through the
open doorways. So came they into the hall, a great company of folk, and
cried with a loud voice to the lord of the castle, "Alas, master, here
lieth dead the best knight that one might find in the wide world, even
your dear son. There liveth not his like on earth, so strong, so bold,
so skilled in valiant deeds!"

Then was all the burg aghast; and the host, the father of the knight who
lay dead upon the bier, felt his heart die within him. Scarce might he
find words; and he cried, "Who hath robbed him of life, mine own dear
son, whom I loved above all the world? How came he by his death? I fear
me 'twas by his own deed, for well I know that he was fierce of heart,
and spared neither foe nor friend. I fear lest he have merited his
death. Now do I conjure ye all here present, by God, our Righteous
Father (so spake the lord of the castle) that ye speak, and make known
to me the whole truth; fain would I hear how he came by his death, my
dear son, who lieth here, and for whom my heart doth sorely grieve."

Then said they all who brought the dead man thither, that forsooth 'twas
a stranger knight who did this by his great valour; "Though we saw it
not with our eyes, yet may we well bear witness to the death of many of
our folk; and others are so sorely wounded that they may never more be
healed. Man may scarce tell all the mischief wrought by that stranger
knight who slew your son, the best knight on earth; nor may we tell who
he might be." But Sir Gawain, who was there within, and knew well that
he was guilty, saw that he might scarce escape either by will or by
valour, since he had laid aside his weapons and stood all unarmed in his
robes; thereof was he grieved at heart.

As they stood and spake thus, sudden they saw the blood of the knight
who lay there dead, and which afore was stanched, leap forth afresh, and
run crimson down the hall. With this were they ware of Sir Gawain, their
lord's guest, and all they who were there present said, the one taking
up the tale of the other, that forsooth he who had slain the knight was
within that hall, as might be seen of men, for the blood had ceased to
flow a little after midday, nor had any man seen the wounds bleed since.
Now was it open and manifest to all that he was there who had done the
deed. Herein were they all of one mind who were there present, and they
drew together and looked upon Sir Gawain the Father of Adventure, with
fierce and cruel eyes.

Sir Gawain saw many an unfriendly countenance turned towards him. They
straitly prayed their lord that he would make the knight known to them;
how he came thither; who he was, whence he came, and whither he went,
and what might be his name?

Then spake the host: "He is my guest, and he hath my safe conduct, good
and fast, the while he is within; and be ye sure of this, that if any
wrong him by word or deed, he shall rue it in such wise that it shall
cost him goods and life. Nor will I change for prayer of man or woman.
My surety that I will hold to every guest standeth so fast that no
word I have spoken shall be broken with my knowledge or my will. Have
patience and hold ye still, on peril of your lives and goods. I know so
good counsel withal that I may speedily be ware of him who hath wrought
this deed."

Then he called together his folk to one side of the hall, and said that
his oath and his safe conduct might in no wise be broken, for his son
were thereby but ill-avenged, valiant knight though he was. He might
well rue it if he slew his guest, for thereof should he have great shame
wherever men told the tale. "I shall avenge him more discreetly, if I be
well-assured of the truth that my guest hath indeed wrought this murder
and this great outrage."

He spake further to his folk: "Now do ye all my bidding. Ye shall abide
here within this hall; no man shall follow me a foot, but do ye even as
I command. I will lead my guest without, and ye shall close the door
behind us. Doth the dead man cease to bleed, then shall we all be
well-assured that he hath done the deed; and thereafter shall I take
counsel how I may avenge my son, fittingly, and without shame." Then all
agreed to his counsel, and held their peace.

Thus came the host to where Sir Gawain stood, and spake: "Sir Knight,
be not wroth that my folk entreat ye not better. We are in grief, as ye
see, and therefore are ye the worse served. Now shall ye come with me,
and I shall amend what hath here been lacking. My folk and my household
make great lamentation, as ye see, and I with them. Now come with me,
and tarry not; I will lead ye hence where ye may be at ease, and sleep
softly till the daylight. Here would we make our moan."

Sir Gawain thought within himself he was sorely over-matched within
those (to be bare of weapons 'tis a heavy blow at need), and he knew
well that the folk looked on him with unfriendly eyes, and that none
were on his side, that might be seen from their mien; and therefore he
thought within himself that there was no better counsel save to put
himself in his host's grace, and do that which he bade him. He had no
weapon upon him, and there were within of his host's folk full five
hundred men whom he saw to be armed. Thus he went his way with his host,
whether the adventure should turn to his harm or to his helping. The
lord of the castle led him through the doorway, and his men locked it as
they went forth.

Then quoth the lord of those within: "Sir Knight and dear guest, I will
that ye be right well entreated here within this night." He led him to
a strong tower, wherein were fair beds. He bade them bear tapers before
them, and all that he knew or could in any wise deem needful for Sir
Gawain, his guest. The host, sorely mourning, bade them pour out clear
wine, and make ready a fair couch whereon he might sleep even as he had
the will thereto. He left with him squires enow, and turned him again to
the castle.

Then did they bear the dead man from where he lay, his wounds were
stanched, and bled no whit. Then said all who saw it it booted not to
seek another man, they were well assured 'twas their guest had slain
him. The word ran through the hall; and the host turned him again to
where he had left his guest, as if he marked naught. He made no sign to
his folk, but locked the door of the tower so fast that none might come
therein to Sir Gawain to do him harm, nor overpower him, so safely was
he in his keeping. Also, I tell ye, he himself kept the keys of the
strong tower wherein he had locked his guest. He would bethink him what
'twere best to do ere he let him be slain or maimed; thus did he hold
him within his fortress.

What might Sir Gawain do? He must even abide his fate; he had come
thither as guest, and now was he locked in a strong tower, within many
doors, and in a strange place withal. He was bare of arms, and had he
revealed himself and demanded his weapons they had scarce given them
to him; rather had they slain him, and drawn blood-guiltiness upon
themselves had not God protected him.

Thus was Sir Gawain a captive, and knew not what he might do. 'Twixt
constraint and ill-fortune the night seemed to him over long; though he
feared him no whit yet he deemed his end was come. He knew well that the
folk were evil-disposed and bare malice and rancour towards him for the
sake of the dead man who lay there, in that they had seen his wounds
bleed afresh, and had thereby known his slayer. Thus was his heart
sorely troubled.

Now leave we speaking of Sir Gawain. The host was within the hall, with
his folk until daylight; with sorrow and lamentation did they pass the
night, bemoaning their bitter loss. For though the knight had well
deserved his death yet had he there many friends who lamented the loss
that they had thereby suffered. They were loth to own that he was evil
and cruel of heart.

So soon as they saw the fair day light the host took counsel with his
folk that they might advise him well by what means, and in what way,
they might avenge themselves for their heavy loss. Said the host, their
lord, did he let the guest, whom he held there captive, and who had
smitten his son to death, depart in safety, "Men would say I were but
a coward, and durst not avenge myself, and would speak scorn of me;
so many have seen how the matter fell out that it may not well remain
hidden. Yet should I slay my guest then from henceforward would they cry
shame upon me in every land where the tale be told."

Thus was he of two minds, and thought in his heart that to save himself
from shame 'twere best to let his guest depart so soon as he arose,
armed in all points as he came thither, and harm him in no wise, but
bring him, unhurt by any man, without the borders of his land and his
safe conduct, and there bid him farewell and return hither; while that
his friends, who would fain see him avenged, waylaid Sir Gawain, and
wrought their will upon him, and, if they would, slew him. Or if they
took him captive they might deal with him as they thought best, either
by burning him in the fire, to cool their rage, or by breaking him upon
the wheel--as might seem best to them at the time. "Thus shall I put the
shame from me, that neither near nor afar, now or henceforward, men
make scorn of me. This seemeth to me the wisest rede in this matter,
howsoe'er it stand!"

This did he tell to his folk, and it pleased them well, and they spake
with one mouth that he had found the best counsel. They made no further
questioning, but armed themselves, and rode forth, as they who would
waylay Sir Gawain, when his host had sent him on his way. Thus they went
forth from thence a great company, and well armed. Very wrathful were
they, and they went right willingly. The host who would follow them
called to him his seneschal, who was cruel and cunning, and bade him
carry his armour to their guest straightway, and deliver it to him as if
he should ride thence as soon as he had arisen, and delay no whit.

Straightway the seneschal betook him to a fair chamber (hearken ye to an
evil tale!) where he found Sir Gawain's weapons and his good armour. He
stole from Sir Gawain his good sword, that which he placed in its sheath
was not worth twopence; he cut the straps of the harness well nigh in
twain in the midst, and made a great score in the stirrup leathers
so cunningly that no man might see or know aught thereof beneath the
covering of the harness. And the saddle-girths did the traitor so handle
that Sir Gawain was sore grieved there-for ere he had ridden a mile; he
would not that it had so chanced for all King Arthur's kingdom--that
shall ye hear anon.

When the seneschal who had wrought this treason had brought Sir Gawain's
weapons and his horse that had been well cared for that night--they
deemed it should be theirs ere long, 'twas a strong steed and well
standing, and since they thought to have their pleasure of it they
gave it provender enow--the host bade them undo the door and hold Sir
Gawain's steed there without. The harness was in place, whereof I have
told ye that it was so traitorously handled; then came forth the knight,
who had arisen, and clad himself in fair robes, and descended the
stairway. Little thought had he of the treason which in short while
befell him. The seneschal held in his hand the false sword, well hidden
in its sheath, and the while Sir Gawain made him ready did he gird it at
his side--for that was the knight thereafter unblithe.

The while they thus made ready came the lord of the castle to Sir
Gawain, and said: "Ye are early astir Sir Knight; how comes it that ye
be thus hurried at this time? Scarce have ye slept, and arisen, ere
ye would ride hence. Have ye heard Mass, and broken your fast ere ye
depart?"

Quoth Sir Gawain: "Dear mine host, I grieve that ye yet sorrow; so may
God guard me and bring me to His grace when I die as I truly mourn for
your mischance. I will it were yet to do!" Quoth Sir Gawain the bold:
"Though 'twere hard and painful to me yet would I for seven years long
wear haircloth next my body, wherever I fared, for this that ye have
received me so well. Nevertheless be ye sure of a truth--I may not deny
it this day for any man, how strong soever he might be, nor through fear
of any that may hear me, foe or friend--but I must needs say in sooth
your son had merited his death many a time and oft ere the day came that
he died! Now may God have mercy upon him! And God reward ye for the
great good, and the honour, that ye do to me, all ye here, in that I
have been at your charges."

Then was the host sore vexed, and he said: "I will do ye no harm for
aught that hath chanced by ye; nevertheless, there be here many a man
who had fain fallen upon ye, but I tell ye I will not that aught befall
ye here; nor that my peace be broken, nor vengeance taken upon ye. I
shall go with ye as ye ride hence, and ride with ye so far that ye be
not led astray by any who remain behind. I were loth that harm befell
ye."

Sir Gawain spake: "For that may God, who ruleth over all, reward ye." He
took the bridle in his hand and rode forth, the host nigh to him; and at
his side went he who had betrayed him aforehand. Now cometh great sorrow
upon Sir Gawain. He deemed that he had safe conduct, but he had lost
from its sheath his sword, which had been stolen from him; and that
which the seneschal had put in its place when he drew forth the good
brand was more brittle than glass. Thereto had he cunningly handled the
harness, girths and stirrup-leather, whereof Sir Gawain knew naught, and
the lord of the castle had sent afore the strongest and most valiant
of his folk, to waylay Sir Gawain, and to take his life, A man's heart
might well fail him for doubt, and great fear, did he come in such a
pass, and know no wile whereby he might escape.

Sir Gawain, who knew naught of these tricks and snares rode on his way,
discoursing of many things with his host, until they drew nigh to the
place where his foes lay, ambushed in the thicket, who would fain slay
him. When he came nigh to the place the host took leave of the knight,
and turned him again towards the castle. Sir Gawain sat upon his steed
and deemed that he should ride thence without strife or combat. As he
laid his hand on the saddle-bow, and thrust his feet into the stirrups
and thought to rise in the saddle, the girths brake asunder, the saddle
turned over the left stirrup beneath the horse, and left him standing.
Then Sir Gawain saw a great company of folk spring forth and come
towards him with all their might. Some came from the ditches where they
had lain hidden, some out of bushes, some out of thickets, and some came
forth from the hollow ways. God confound traitors, since He may not mend
them!

Sir Gawain abode not still; he saw well that he was betrayed, and
over-matched. He drew forth from its sheath the sword, which was little
worth to him, and deemed he would defend himself, as he oft had done
aforetime, against those who would harm him. But ere he might smite
three blows that sword brake, as it were tin--this was an ill beginning
would a man defend his life. This Sir Gawain saw, and was dismayed, he
wist well that he was betrayed. They who would harm him came upon him
from every side, a great company and fierce, all thirsting for his life;
there was a great clash of swords; they thrust at him with their spears.
His sword protected him not a whit--he who gave it to him God give him
woe! It brake in twain at the hilt, and fell into the sand. Sir Gawain
stood empty-handed, small chance had he of escape, and they who beset
him were chosen men, over-strong and over-fierce, as was there well
proven. Like as a wild boar defends himself against the hounds that
pursue him, even so did Sir Gawain defend himself, but it helped him
naught. They harmed him most who stood afar, and thrust at him with
spears to sate their rage. There was among them no sword so good but had
Sir Gawain held it, and smote with it three such blows as he was oft
wont to deal with his own, it had broken, or bent, and profited them no
whit. But of those things which had stood him in good stead many a time
before, when he was hard beset, his good steed, and his sword, the which
was a very haven, of these was he now robbed.

Thus was Sir Gawain overcome, and me thinks 'twas little marvel! There
lives no man so strong or so valiant but he may some time be vanquished
by force, or by fraud. Sir Gawain must needs yield him; he was felled to
the ground, yet were there some to whom it cost their life ere he was
captive, and some it cost a limb, or twain, that might never more be
healed; and he himself was so sore mis-handled that all he ware, whether
it were armour or other clothing, was rent in many a place, so that the
flesh might be seen. There lived on earth no man so wise that he might
aid him in this stress, nor leech who might heal him; yet, an God will,
he shall he healed of his smart and of his shame.

They bound Sir Gawain's hands, and set him on a sorry hack, and to anger
him they led beside him Gringalet, his steed. This they did that he
might be the more sorrowful when he beheld his horse, which he had now
lost, and his own life withal! For of this would they deprive him, and
make him to die a shameful death; burn him they would, or break him upon
the wheel, that they might wreak their vengeance upon him. There were
among them knights and squires, the richest, and the most nobly born
after the lord of the land; and all had sworn an oath that they would
lead Sir Gawain to the cross-roads, at the entering in of their land for
the greater shaming of King Arthur's Court. To this had they pledged
themselves, that they would there slay him without respite or delay; and
were it not that 'twere shame to themselves, and too great dishonour to
one who bare the name of knight, they had hung him by the neck, on the
border of the two lands, to shame King Arthur; so that all his folk
who were of the knightly order, and dwelt at his court, and sought for
adventure, should shun their land when they heard the tidings of the
vengeance wrought by them upon knights-errant who would prove their
fate within those borders.

Thus it fell out that they brought Sir Gawain on the horse, sorely
wounded and mishandled, within the nearness of half a mile, so that
the knight knew he was nigh to the cell of the Hermit of whom at that
self-same cross-road he had asked tidings of King Arthur's knights, and
of that bad and evil land where many were brought to shame. And they who
had brought him thither were of one mind that they should make a wheel,
and break the knight upon it at the Cross by the parting of the ways
whereof I have told ye afore.

Now shall I leave speaking of this matter till I come again thereto,
and will forthwith tell ye how it fared with Morien when the three
had parted asunder, as I told ye afore (Sir Gawain, Morien, and Sir
Lancelot, he was the third), since they would fain make proof of that
which the Hermit had told them. Now will I tell ye of Morien ere that
I end the tale of Sir Gawain. Now doth the adventure tell that Morien,
that bold knight, rode the seaward way, and came safely to the passage
of the ford nigh unto the open sea. And all the day he met no man of
whom he might ask concerning his father; 'twas labour wasted, for all
who saw him fled from him. Little good might his asking do him, since
none who might walk or ride would abide his coming. But he saw there the
hoof-prints of horses, which lay before him and were but newly made; by
this he deemed that his father had passed that way but a short while
before.

Thus he followed the hoof-tracks to the passage of the sea. That night
had he neither rest nor slumber, nor found he place where he might
shelter, or where it seemed to him he might ask for food or lodging
beneath a roof.

The morning early, even as it dawned and men might see clearly and well
(which comforted him much), he came safely ahorse to where one might
make the crossing, but he saw never a soul; no man dwelt thereabout, for
the robbers had laid waste the land, and driven away the folk so that
none remained. 'Twas all heath and sand, and no land beside; there grew
neither barley nor wheat. He saw and heard no man, nor did folk come and
go there, but he saw ships at anchor, and shipmen therein, who were wont
to take over those folk who would cross into Ireland.

Morien came riding over the sea-sand, and cried with a loud voice
shipward: "Ye who be within tell me that which I ask lest it be to your
own loss, as also I would fain know for my own profit and rejoicing.
Know ye if any within these few days past have carried a knight over the
water?"

But all they who lay in the ships, when they beheld Morien who had
doffed his helm, were so afeard for him that they might neither hear nor
understand question nor answer. They were altogether in fear of him,
since he was so tall, and black withal. Each man turned his boat
seaward, and put off from the shore, for Morien was to look upon even as
if he were come out of hell. They deemed they had seen the Foul Fiend
himself, who would fain deceive them, so they departed as swiftly as
they might and would in no wise abide his coming. Then must Morien turn
him again, for none would hearken to his speech nor tell him that which
he fain would know; all were of one mind that 'twas the Devil, and none
else, who rode there upon the sand, so they fled with one consent from
the shore.

Morien saw well that his labour was in vain, for would he make the
crossing there was no man would abide his coming or receive him into his
boat. Thus must he needs turn him back, and great lamentation did he
make thereof. He saw the footprints where two horses had ridden afore
him, and ever he hoped that 'twas his father who rode there, and that
he had crossed the water, but he thought within himself: "What doth it
profit a man to labour if he know it to be in vain? None will take me
over the water since I am a Moor, and of other countenance than the
dwellers in this land; this my journey is for naught. I may not do
better than return to the Hermit, that good man, there where I parted
from my comrades." He had neither eaten nor drunk since that he rode
thence; his head was dazed with hunger and with grief. He looked behind
and afore, and saw nowhere where food was in preparing, nor saw he man
nor woman, nor creature that had life, upon the seashore.

Then he rode swiftly upon the backward trail till he came once more
to the parting of the ways; there found he carpenter-folk hewing and
shaping timber, whereof they had made a great wheel. He saw a knight
sitting upon the ground, in sore distress, naked and covered with blood;
he had been brought thither to be broken upon the wheel, so soon as it
might be made ready. Well might his heart misgive him!

Morien who came thither saw the gleam of many a hauberk; there were
armed folk enow! Others there were who were but in evil case, unarmed,
and unclad, who were scarce whole. Their limbs were bandaged, some
the arm, some the leg, some the head, and stained with blood. And Sir
Gawain, who sat there sore mishandled, knew that well, and as Morien
came nigh, he cried, so that all might hear: "Dear my comrade, ye be
welcome. God give me joy of your coming hither! I am Gawain, your
comrade; little did I foresee this mischance when we parted, you and I,
at this cross-way! Have pity upon the sore stress in which ye see me.
May God who hath power over us all strengthen ye well; would that He
might here show forth His power!"

When Morien who was hard beset by them who stood there heard this, never
might one hear in book or song that any man smote such fierce blows as
he smote with the sword which he drew forth. Do what he might with
that sword it suffered neither dint nor scar; he smote straight to the
mid-ward; nor was their harness so good that it might withstand him.
Thereto helped his great strength, that he fought so fiercely against
them who withstood him, and smote such ghastly wounds that nevermore
might they be healed, nor salved by the hand of any leech. He clave many
to the teeth, through helm and coif, so that they fell to the ground.
And ever as he cast his eyes around and they lighted upon Sir Gawain,
who was in such evil case, his courage waxed so great that were the
Devil himself against him he had slain him even as a man; might he die,
he had there lost his life. Sir Gawain sat by the wayside in sorry
plight, with his hands bound; but the good knight Morien so drave aback
the folk who had brought him thither that they had little thought for
him. He defended him so well with his mighty blows that none might come
at him to harm him; he felled them by twos and by threes, some under
their horses, some beside them. The space began to widen round Sir
Gawain and Morien; for all there deemed that he came forth from hell,
and was hight Devil, in that he so quelled them and felled them
underfoot that many hereafter spake thereof. That men thrust and smote
at him troubled him little, therein was he like to his father, the noble
knight Sir Agloval; he held parley with no man, but smote ever, blow
after blow, on all who came nigh him. His blows were so mighty; did a
spear fly towards him, to harm him, it troubled him no whit, but he
smote it in twain as it were a reed; naught might endure before him.
He ware a hauberk that bold overstrong hero, wherewith he was none
too heavy laden, yet none might harm him with any weapon they brought
thither. Then might ye see the blood run red upon the ground for the
good knight's sword spared neither horse nor man. There might ye see
lying heads and hands, arms and legs; some hewn from the body, some
smitten in twain. They who might escape death fared little better, for
good fortune had departed from them--thus many chose their end. He who
came betimes to the conflict, and fled without waiting to see what might
chance further, he was blithe! Thus were they put to rout, and either
slain or driven from the field, or helpless of limb; some who came
thither ahorse had lost their steeds, and must rue their journey. They
might no longer ride, but must go hence afoot.

Then Morien dismounted, and took Sir Gawain in his arms, and said full
oft, "Alas, my comrade, how were ye thus betrayed? I fear physician may
aid ye never more, ye have wounds so many and so sore."

With that he had unbound his hands; and Sir Gawain said: "Of physician
have I no need." He thanked God and Morien a hundredfold, that he was
thus delivered from peril, and comforted in his need; his heart was
light within him, and he said he should speedily mend might he but have
repose for two days, and neither walk nor ride; by the help of God, and
by leechcraft and the aid of certain herbs the virtue of which he knew
well, so might he regain all his strength.

Now had they left upon the field Gringalet and certain other steeds,
the masters whereof were slain or had fled afar. Gringalet was bare of
harness, he had lost his saddle as ye heard afore, and therefore no man
had mounted him. He who had brought him thither had forgat him upon that
field, his journey had been dearly bought and he lay there dead in the
green grass. And Sir Gawain when he was ware of that was fain to forget
all his pain. He arose from where he sat, and went towards his steed,
and as he looked upon him his heart rose high within him, and he deemed
that he was well-nigh healed. And even as he came Gringalet knew his
lord, nor would flee from him, but came towards him, and for very
friendship seized him with his teeth.

Then did they abide no longer, but betook them to the hermit who had
been sore afeard for all that he heard and saw through the window of his
cell. He knew the two knights well, when he heard their tale, and how
that they were even the same who had but lately passed his way, and he
spake to the Father of Adventure: "Even so did I foretell ye when ye
would ride toward that land, and I prayed ye to refrain. But that would
ye not do, and so have ye come to harm therein! They who are fain to
despise counsel ofttimes do so to their own mischief. But since it hath
so befallen, think ye what may best profit ye, and abide overnight with
me, here within; for an ye depart hence I know not where ye may find
shelter. That evil beast whereof I spake when ye were here afore hath so
laid waste the land that no man dwelleth herein. If I still dwell here
'tis that I have no need to flee nor to fear death ere my day come,
when as it hath been foretold and declared I shall break the rule of my
order. A long tale is ill to hear, I will weary ye not, but see that
naught be lacking to your ease. Ye shall stable your steeds, and abide
this night within my chapel. That which I have will I give ye, for the
love of God and the honour of knighthood." Then Sir Gawain and Morien
his comrade thanked him much, and went their way to the chapel, where
they abode throughout the day; each told to the other his adventures as
they had befallen, neither more nor less. The hermit tended the horses
well with all that was needful to them; he bade the lad who served him,
as a good man doth his friend, bring forth all the store that he had
within, and fetch water from the spring, and warm it to Sir Gawain's
liking that he might therewith wash his limbs, and cleanse them from
the blood. He had upon him no mortal wound, so good was his hauberk,
otherwise had he lost his life from the blows he had received.
