 few
days ago, I did not expect a repetition of the same pleasure so soon;
... but having the enclosed poem, &c.' It is probable that in these few
days the poem was written. If we can assume that Savage's elegy was sent
to the Court not later than March 1--it may have been sent earlier--and
that Johnson's poem was written in the last ten days of March, we have
three weeks for the intervening events. They are certainly not more than
sufficient, if indeed they are sufficient. The coincidence is certainly
very striking between Thales's retirement to 'Cambria's solitary shore'
and Savage's retirement to Wales. There are besides lines in the
poem--additions to Juvenal and not translations--which curiously
correspond with what Johnson wrote of Savage in his _Life_. Thus he says
that Savage 'imagined that he should be transported to scenes of flowery
felicity; ... he could not bear ... to lose the opportunity of
listening, without intermission, to the melody of the nightingale, which
he believed was to be heard from every bramble, and which he did not
fail to mention as a very important part of the happiness of a country
life' (_Ib_. p. 170). In like manner Thales prays to find:--

'Some pleasing bank where verdant osiers play,
Some peaceful vale, with nature's paintings gay.

       *       *       *       *       *

There every bush with nature's musick rings;
There every breeze bears health upon its wings.'

Mr. Croker objects that 'if Thales had been Savage, Johnson could never
have admitted into his poem two lines that point so forcibly at the
drunken fray, in which Savage stabbed a Mr. Sinclair, for which he was
convicted of _murder_:--

"Some frolic _drunkard_, reeling from a feast,
_Provokes_ a broil, and _stabs_ you in a jest."'

But here Johnson is following Juvenal. Mr. Croker forgets that, if
Savage was convicted of murder, 'he was soon after admitted to bail, and
pleaded the King's pardon.' 'Persons of distinction' testified that he
was 'a modest inoffensive man, not inclined to broils or to insolence;'
the witnesses against him were of the lowest character, and his judge
had shewn himself as ignorant as he was brutal. Sinclair had been
drinking in a brothel, and Savage asserted that he had stabbed him 'by
the necessity of self defence' (_Ib_. p. 117). It is, however, not
unlikely that Wales was suggested to Johnson as Thales's retreat by
Swift's lines on Steele, in _Miscellanies in Prose and Verse_ (v. 181),
published only three years before _London_:--

'Thus Steele who owned what others writ,
And flourished by imputed wit,
From perils of a hundred jails
Withdrew to starve and die in Wales.'

[363] The first dialogue was registered at Stationers' Hall, 12th May,
1738, under the title _One Thousand Seven Hundred and Thirty Eight_. The
second dialogue was registered 17th July, 1738, as _One Thousand Seven
Hundred and Thirty Eight, Dialogue_ 2. Elwin's _Pope_, iii. 455.

David Hume was in London this spring, finding a publisher for his first
work, _A Treatise of Human Nature_. J. H. Burton's _Hume_, i. 66.

[364] Pope had published _Imitations of Horace_.

[365] P. 269. BOSWELL. 'Short extracts from _London, a Poem_, become
remarkable for having got to the second edition in the space of a week.'
_Gent. Mag_. viii. 269. The price of the poem was one shilling. Pope's
satire, though sold at the same price, was longer in reaching its second
edition (_Ib_. p. 280).

[366]

'One driven by strong benevolence of soul
Shall fly, like Oglethorpe, from pole to pole.'

Pope's _Imitations of Horace_, ii. 2. 276.

'General Oglethorpe, died 1785, earned commemoration in Pope's gallery
of worthies by his Jacobite politics. He was, however, a remarkable man.
He first directed attention to the abuses of the London jails. His
relinquishment of all the attractions of English life and fortune for
the settlement of the colony of Georgia is as romantic a story at that
of Bishop Berkeley' (Pattison's _Pope_, p. 152). It is very likely that
Johnson's regard for Oglethorpe was greatly increased by the stand that
he and his brother-trustees in the settlement of Georgia made against
slavery (see _post_, Sept. 23, 1777). 'The first principle which they
laid down in their laws was that no slave should be employed. This was
regarded at the time as their great and fundamental error; it was
afterwards repealed' (Southey's _Wesley_, i. 75). In spite, however, of
Oglethorpe's 'strong benevolence of soul' he at one time treated Charles
Wesley, who was serving as a missionary in Georgia, with great brutality
(_Ib_. p. 88). According to Benjamin Franklin (_Memoirs_, i. 162)
Georgia was settled with little forethought. 'Instead of being made with
hardy industrious husbandmen, it was with families of broken
shop-keepers, and other insolvent debtors; many of idle habits, taken
out of the jails, who being set down in the woods, unqualified for
clearing land, and unable to endure the hardships of a new settlement,
perished in numbers, leaving many helpless children unprovided for.'
Johnson wished to write Oglethorpe's life; _post_, April 10, 1775.

[367] Horace Walpole (_Letters_, viii. 548), writing of him 47 years
after _London_ was published, when he was 87 years old, says:--'His
eyes, ears, articulation, limbs, and memory would suit a boy, if a boy
could recollect a century backwards. His teeth are gone; he is a shadow,
and a wrinkled one; but his spirits and his spirit are in full bloom:
two years and a-half ago he challenged a neighbouring gentleman for
trespassing on his manor.'

[368] Once Johnson being at dinner at Sir Joshua's in company with many
painters, in the course of conversation Richardson's _Treatise on
Painting_ happened to be mentioned, 'Ah!' said Johnson, 'I remember,
when I was at college, I by chance found that book on my stairs. I took
it up with me to my chamber, and read it through, and truly I did not
think it possible to say so much upon the art.' Sir Joshua desired of
one of the company to be informed what Johnson had said; and it being
repeated to him so loud that Johnson heard it, the Doctor seemed hurt,
and added, 'But I did not wish, Sir, that Sir Joshua should have been
told what I then said.' Northcote's _Reynolds_, i. 236. Jonathan
Richardson the painter had published several works on painting before
Johnson went to college. He and his son, Jonathan Richardson, junior,
brought out together _Explanatory Notes on Paradise Lost_.

[369] Sir Joshua Reynolds, from the information of the younger
Richardson. BOSWELL. See _post_, Oct. 16, 1769, where Johnson himself
relates this anecdote. According to Murphy, 'Pope said, "The author,
whoever he is, will not be long concealed;" alluding to the passage in
Terence [_Eun_. ii. 3, 4], _Ubi, ubi est, diu celari non potest_.'
Murphy's _Johnson_, p. 35.

[370] Such as _far_ and _air_, which comes twice; _vain_ and _man_,
_despair_ and _bar_.

[371] It is, however, remarkable, that he uses the epithet, which
undoubtedly, since the union between England and Scotland, ought to
denominate the natives of both parts of our island:--

'Was early taught a BRITON'S rights to prize.'

BOSWELL.

Swift, in his _Journal to Stella_ (Nov. 23, 1711), having to mention
England, continues:--'I never will call it _Britain_, pray don't call it
Britain.' In a letter written on Aug. 8, 1738, again mentioning England,
he adds,--'Pox on the modern phrase Great Britain, which is only to
distinguish it from Little Britain, where old clothes and old books are
to be bought and sold' (Swift's _Works_, 1803, xx. 185). George III
'gloried in being born a Briton;' _post_, 1760. Boswell thrice more at
least describes Johnson as 'a true-born Englishman;' _post_, under Feb.
7, 1775, under March 30, 1783, and Boswell's _Hebrides_ under Aug. 11,
1773. The quotation is from _Richard II_, Act i. sc. 3.

[372]

'For who would leave, unbrib'd, Hibernia's land,
Or change the rocks of Scotland for the Strand?
There none are swept by sudden fate away,
But all, whom hunger spares, with age decay.'

_London_, 1. 9-12.

[373] In the _Life of Savage_, Johnson, criticising the settlement of
colonies, as it is considered by the poet and the politician, seems to
be criticising himself. 'The politician, when he considers men driven
into other countries for shelter, and obliged to retire to forests and
deserts, and pass their lives, and fix their posterity, in the remotest
corners of the world, to avoid those hardships which they suffer or fear
in their native place, may very properly enquire, why the legislature
does not provide a remedy for these miseries, rather than encourage an
escape from them. He may conclude that the flight of every honest man is
a loss to the community.... The poet guides the unhappy fugitive from
want and persecution to plenty, quiet, and security, and seats him in
scenes of peaceful solitude, and undisturbed repose.' Johnson's _Works_,
viii. 156.

[374] Three years later Johnson wrote:--'Mere unassisted merit advances
slowly, if, what is not very common, it advances at all.' _Ib_. vi. 393.

[375] 'The busy _hum_ of men.' Milton's _L'Allegro_, 1. 118.

[376] See Boswell's _Hebrides_, Oct. 21, 1773, and _post_, March 21,
1775, for Johnson's attack on Lord Chatham. In the _Life of Thomson_
Johnson wrote:--'At this time a long course of opposition to Sir Robert
Walpole had filled the nation with clamours for liberty, of which no man
felt the want, and with care for liberty, which was not in danger.'
Johnson's _Works_, viii. 370. Hawkins says (_Life_, p. 514);--'Of
Walpole he had a high opinion. He said of him that he was a fine fellow,
and that his very enemies deemed him so before his death. He honoured
his memory for having kept this country in peace many years, as also for
the goodness and placability of his temper.' Horace Walpole (_Letters_,
v. 509), says:--'My father alone was capable of acting on one great plan
of honesty from the beginning of his life to the end. He could for ever
wage war with knaves and malice, and preserve his temper; could know
men, and yet feel for them; could smile when opposed, and be gentle
after triumph.'

[377] Johnson in the _Life of Milton_ describes himself:--'Milton was
naturally a thinker for himself, confident of his own abilities, and
disdainful of help or hindrance. From his contemporaries he neither
courted nor received support; there is in his writings nothing by which
the pride of other authors might be gratified, or favour gained; no
exchange of praise, nor solicitation of support.' Johnson's _Works_,
vii. 142. See _post_ Feb. 1766, for Johnson's opinion on 'courting
great men.'

[378] In a billet written by Mr. Pope in the following year, this school
is said to have been in _Shropshire_; but as it appears from a letter
from Earl Gower, that the trustees of it were 'some worthy gentlemen in
Johnson's neighbourhood,' I in my first edition suggested that Pope must
have, by mistake, written Shropshire, instead of Staffordshire. But I
have since been obliged to Mr. Spearing, attorney-at-law, for the
following information:--'William Adams, formerly citizen and haberdasher
of London, founded a school at Newport, in the county of Salop, by deed
dated 27th November, 1656, by which he granted "the yearly sum of _sixty
pounds_ to such able and learned schoolmaster, from time to time, being
of godly life and conversation, who should have been educated at one of
the Universities of Oxford or Cambridge, and had taken the degree of
_Master of Arts_, and was well read in the Greek and Latin tongues, as
should be nominated from time to time by the said William Adams, during
his life, and after the decease of the said William Adams, by the
Governours (namely, the Master and Wardens of the Haberdashers' Company
of the City of London) and their successors." The manour and lands out
of which the revenues for the maintenance of the school were to issue
are situate _at Knighton and Adbaston, in the county of Stafford_.' From
the foregoing account of this foundation, particularly the circumstances
of the salary being sixty pounds, and the degree of Master of Arts being
a requisite qualification in the teacher, it seemed probable that this
was the school in contemplation; and that Lord Gower erroneously
supposed that the gentlemen who possessed the lands, out of which the
revenues issued, were trustees of the charity.

Such was probable conjecture. But in the _Gent. Mag_. for May, 1793,
there is a letter from Mr. Henn, one of the masters of the school of
Appleby, in Leicestershire, in which he writes as follows:--

'I compared time and circumstance together, in order to discover whether
the school in question might not be this of Appleby. Some of the
trustees at that period were "worthy gentlemen of the neighbourhood of
Litchfield." Appleby itself is not far from the neighbourhood of
Litchfield. The salary, the degree requisite, together with the _time of
election_, all agreeing with the statutes of Appleby. The election, as
said in the letter, "could not be delayed longer than the 11th of next
month," which was the 11th of September, just three months after the
annual audit-day of Appleby school, which is always on the 11th of June;
and the statutes enjoin _ne ullius praeceptorum electio diutius tribus
mensibus moraretur, etc_.

'These I thought to be convincing proofs that my conjecture was not
ill-founded, and that, in a future edition of that book, the
circumstance might be recorded as fact.

'But what banishes every shadow of doubt is the _Minute-book_ of the
school, which declares the headmastership to be _at that time_ VACANT.'

I cannot omit returning thanks to this learned gentleman for the very
handsome manner in which he has in that letter been so good as to speak
of this work. BOSWELL.

[379] 'What a pity it is, Sir,' said to him Sir William Scott,
afterwards Lord Stowell, 'that you did not follow the profession of the
law! You might have been Lord Chancellor of Great Britain' _Post_,

[382] In the _Weekly Miscellany_, October 21, 1738, there appeared the
following advertisement:--'Just published, Proposals for printing the
_History of the Council of Trent_, translated from the Italian of Father
Paul Sarpi; with the Authour's Life, and Notes theological, historical,
and critical, from the French edition of Dr. Le Courayer. To which are
added, Observations on the History, and Notes and Illustrations from
various Authours, both printed and manuscript. By S. Johnson. 1. The
work will consist of two hundred sheets, and be two volumes in quarto,
printed on good paper and letter. 2. The price will be 18_s_. each
volume, to be paid, half-a-guinea at the delivery of the first volume,
and the rest at the delivery of the second volume in sheets. 3.
Two-pence to be abated for every sheet less than two hundred. It may be
had on a large paper, in three volumes, at the price of three guineas;
one to be paid at the time of subscribing, another at the delivery of
the first, and the rest at the delivery of the other volumes. The work
is now in the press, and will be diligently prosecuted. Subscriptions
are taken in by Mr. Dodsley in Pall-Mall, Mr. Rivington in St. Paul's

[383] They afterwards appeared in the _Gent. Mag_. [viii. 486] with this
title--'_Verses to Lady Firebrace, at Bury Assizes_.' BOSWELL.

weekly numbers, whence Johnson was to select pieces for the
embellishment of the _Magazine_. NICHOLS. BOSWELL.

fasted for two days at a time; 'he had drunk tea, but eaten no bread;
this was no intentional fasting, but happened just in the course of a

[392] _The Historie of four-footed beasts and serpents_. By Edward
Topsell. London, 1607. Isaac Walton, in the _Complete Angler_, more than
once quotes Topsel. See p. 99 in the reprint of the first edition, where
he says:--'As our Topsel hath with great diligence observed.'

[393] In this preface he describes some pieces as 'deserving no other
fate than to be hissed, torn, and forgotten. Johnson's _Works_, v. 346.

[394] The letter to Mr. Urban in the January number of this year (p. 3)
is, I believe, by Johnson.

[395] 'Yet did Boerhaave not suffer one branch of science to withdraw
his attention from others; anatomy did not withhold him from chymistry,
nor chymistry, enchanting as it is, from the study of botany.' Johnson's
_Works_, vi. 276. See _post_, under Sept. 9, 1779.

[396] _Gent. Mag_. viii. 210, and Johnson's _Works_, i. 170.

[397] What these verses are is not clear. On p. 372 there is an epigram
_Ad Elisam Popi Horto Lauras carpentem_, of which on p. 429 there are
three translations. That by Urbanus may be Johnson's.

[398] _Ib_. p. 654, and Johnson's _Works_, i. 170. On p. 211 of this
volume of the _Gent. Mag_. is given the epigram 'To a lady who spoke in
defence of liberty.' This was 'Molly Aston' mentioned _ante_, p. 83.

[399] To the year 1739 belongs _Considerations on the Case of Dr.
T[rapp]s Sermons. Abridged by Mr. Cave, 1739_; first published in the
_Gent. Mag_. of July 1787. (See _post_ under Nov. 5, 1784, note.) Cave
had begun to publish in the _Gent. Mag_. an abridgment of four sermons
preached by Trapp against Whitefield. He stopped short in the
publication, deterred perhaps by the threat of a prosecution for an
infringement of copy-right. 'On all difficult occasions,' writes the
Editor in 1787, 'Johnson was Cave's oracle; and the paper now before us
was certainly written on that occasion.' Johnson argues that abridgments
are not only legal but also justifiable. 'The design of an abridgment is
to benefit mankind by facilitating the attainment of knowledge ... for
as an incorrect book is lawfully criticised, and false assertions justly
confuted ... so a tedious volume may no less lawfully be abridged,
because it is better that the proprietors should suffer some damage,
than that the acquisition of knowledge should be obstructed with
unnecessary difficulties, and the valuable hours of thousands thrown
away.' Johnson's _Works_, v. 465. Whether we have here Johnson's own
opinion cannot be known. He was writing as Cave's advocate. See also
Boswell's _Hebrides_, Aug. 20, 1773.

[400] In his _Life of Thomson_ Johnson writes:--'About this time the act
was passed for licensing plays, of which the first operation was the
prohibition of _Gustavus Vasa_, a tragedy of Mr. Brooke, whom the public
recompensed by a very liberal subscription; the next was the refusal of
_Edward and Eleonora_, offered by Thomson. It is hard to discover why
either play should have been obstructed.' Johnson's Works, viii. 373.

[401] The Inscription and the Translation of it are preserved in the
_London Magazine_ for the year 1739, p. 244. BOSWELL. See Johnson's
_Works_, vi. 89.

[402] It is a little heavy in its humour, and does not compare well with
the like writings of Swift and the earlier wits.

'Get all your verses printed fair,
    Then let them well be dried;
And Curll must have a special care

No letter with an envelope
    Could give him more delight.'

_Advice to the Grub Street Verse-Writers_. (Swift's _Works_, 1803, xi
32.) Nichols, in a note on this passage, says:--'The original copy of
Pope's _Homer_ is almost entirely written on the covers of letters, and
sometimes between the lines of the letters themselves.' Johnson, in his
_Life of Pope_, writes:--'Of Pope's domestic character frugality was a
part eminently remarkable.... This general care must be universally
approved; but it sometimes appeared in petty artifices of parsimony,
such as the practice of writing his compositions on the back of letters,
as may be seen in the remaining copy of the _Iliad_, by which perhaps in
five years five shillings were saved.' Johnson's _Works_, viii. 312.

[409] According to Sir Joshua Reynolds, 'Every person who knew Dr.
Johnson must have observed that the moment he was left out of the
conversation, whether from his deafness or from whatever cause, but a
few minutes without speaking or listening, his mind appeared to be
preparing itself. He fell into a reverie accompanied with strange antic
gestures; but this he never did when his mind was engaged by the
conversation. These were therefore improperly called convulsions, which
imply involuntary contortions; whereas, a word addressed to him, his
attention was recovered. Sometimes, indeed, it would be near a minute
before he would give an answer, looking as if he laboured to bring his
mind to bear on the question' (Taylor's _Reynolds_, ii. 456). 'I still,
however, think,' wrote Boswell, 'that these gestures were involuntary;
for surely had not that been the case, he would have restrained them in
the public streets' (Boswell's _Hebrides_, under date of Aug. 11, 1773,
note). Dr. T. Campbell, in his _Diary of a Visit to England_, p. 33,
writing of Johnson on March 16, 1775, says:--'He has the aspect of an
idiot, without the faintest ray of sense gleaming from any one
feature--with the most awkward garb, and unpowdered grey wig, on one
side only of his head--he is for ever dancing the devil's jig, and
sometimes he makes the most driveling effort to whistle some thought in
his absent paroxysms.' Miss Burney thus describes him when she first saw
him in 1778:--'Soon after we were seated this great man entered. I have
so true a veneration for him that the very sight of him inspires me with
delight and reverence, notwithstanding the cruel infirmities to which he
is subject; for he has almost perpetual convulsive movements, either of
his hands, lips, feet, or knees, and sometimes of all together.' Mme.
D'Arblay's _Diary_, i. 63. See _post_, under March 30, 1783, Boswell's
note on Johnson's peculiarities.

[410] 'Solitude,' wrote Reynolds, 'to him was horror; nor would he ever
trust himself alone but when employed in writing or reading. He has
often begged me to go home with him to prevent his being alone in the
coach. Any company was better than none; by which he connected himself
with many mean persons whose presence he could command.' Taylor's
_Reynolds_, ii. 455. Johnson writing to Mrs. Thrale, said:--'If the
world be worth winning, let us enjoy it; if it is to be despised, let us
despise it by conviction. But the world is not to be despised but as it
is compared with something better. Company is in itself better than
solitude, and pleasure better than indolence.' _Piozzi Letters_, i. 242.
In _The Idler_, No. 32, he wrote:--'Others are afraid to be alone, and
amuse themselves by a perpetual succession of companions; but the
difference is not great; in solitude we have our dreams to ourselves,
and in company we agree to dream in concert. The end sought in both is
forgetfulness of ourselves.' In _The Rambler_, No. 5, he wrote:--'It may
be laid down as a position which will seldom deceive, that when a man
cannot bear his own company, there is something wrong. He must fly from
himself, either because he feels a tediousness in life from the
equipoise of an empty mind ... or he must be afraid of the intrusion of
some unpleasing ideas, and, perhaps, is struggling to escape from the
remembrance of a loss, the fear of a calamity, or some other thought of
greater horror.'

Cowper, whose temperament was in some respects not unlike Johnson's,
wrote:--'A vacant hour is my abhorrence; because, when I am not
occupied, I suffer under the whole influence of my unhappy temperament.'
Southey's _Cowper_, vi. 146.

[411] Richardson was of the same way of thinking as Hogarth. Writing of
a speech made at the Oxford Commemoration of 1754 by the Jacobite Dr.
King (see _post_, Feb. 1755), he said:--'There cannot be a greater
instance of the lenity of the government he abuses than his pestilent
harangues so publicly made with impunity furnishes (_sic_) all his
readers with.'--_Rich. Corresp_. ii. 197.

[412] Impartial posterity may, perhaps, be as little inclined as Dr.
Johnson was to justify the uncommon rigour exercised in the case of Dr.
Archibald Cameron. He was an amiable and truly honest man; and his
offence was owing to a generous, though mistaken principle of duty.
Being obliged, after 1746, to give up his profession as a physician, and
to go into foreign parts, he was honoured with the rank of Colonel, both
in the French and Spanish service. He was a son of the ancient and
respectable family of Cameron, of Lochiel; and his brother, who was the
Chief of that brave clan, distinguished himself by moderation and
humanity, while the Highland army marched victorious through Scotland.
It is remarkable of this Chief, that though he had earnestly
remonstrated against the attempt as hopeless, he was of too heroick a
spirit not to venture his life and fortune in the cause, when personally
asked by him whom he thought his prince. BOSWELL.

Sir Walter Scott states, in his Introduction to _Redgauntlet_, that the
government of George II were in possession of sufficient evidence that
Dr. Cameron had returned to the Highlands, _not_, as he alleged on his
trial, for family affairs merely, but as the secret agent of the
Pretender in a new scheme of rebellion: the ministers, however,
preferred trying this indefatigable partisan on the ground of his
undeniable share in the insurrection of 1745, rather than rescuing
themselves and their master from the charge of harshness, at the expense
of making it universally known, that a fresh rebellion had been in
agitation so late as 1752. LOCKHART. He was executed on June 7, 1753.
_Gent. Mag_. xxiii. 292. Lord Campbell (_Lives of the Chancellors_, v.
109) says:--'I regard his execution as a wanton atrocity.' Horace
Walpole, however, inclined to the belief that Cameron was engaged in a
new scheme of rebellion. Walpole's _Memoirs of George II_, i. 333.

[413] Horace Walpole says that towards convicts under sentence of death
'George II's disposition in general was merciful, if the offence was not
murder.' He mentions, however, a dreadful exception, when the King sent
to the gallows at Oxford a young man who had been 'guilty of a most
trifling forgery,' though he had been recommended to mercy by the Judge,
who 'had assured him his pardon.' Mercy was refused, merely because the
Judge, Willes, 'was attached to the Prince of Wales.' It is very likely
that this was one of Johnson's 'instances,' as it had happened about
four years earlier, and as an account of the young man had been
published by an Oxonian. Walpole's _Memoirs of the Reign of George
II_, i. 175.

[414] It is strange that when Johnson had been sixteen years in London
he should not be known to Hogarth by sight. 'Mr. Hogarth,' writes Mrs.
Piozzi, 'was used to be very earnest that I should obtain the
acquaintance, and if possible, the friendship of Dr. Johnson, "whose
conversation was to the talk of other men, like Titian's painting
compared to Hudson's," he said.... Of Dr. Johnson, when my father and he
were talking together about him one day, "That man," says Hogarth, "is
not contented with believing the Bible, but he fairly resolves, I think,
to believe nothing _but_ the Bible."' Piozzi's _Anec_. p. 136.

[415] On October 29 of this year James Boswell was born.

[416] In this preface is found the following lively passage:--'The Roman
Gazetteers are defective in several material ornaments of style. They
never end an article with the mystical hint, _this occasions great
speculation_. They seem to have been ignorant of such engaging
introductions as, _we hear it is strongly reported_; and of that
ingenious, but thread-bare excuse for a downright lie, _it wants
confirmation_.'

[417] The _Lives_ of Blake and Drake were certainly written with a
political aim. The war with Spain was going on, and the Tory party was
doing its utmost to rouse the country against the Spaniards. It was 'a
time,' according to Johnson, 'when the nation was engaged in a war with
an enemy, whose insults, ravages, and barbarities have long called for
vengeance.' Johnson's _Works_, vi. 293.

[418] Barretier's childhood surpassed even that of J. S. Mill. At the
age of nine he was master of five languages, Greek and Hebrew being two
of them. 'In his twelfth year he applied more particularly to the study
of the fathers.' At the age of fourteen he published _Anti-Artemonius;
sive initium evangelii S. Joannis adversus Artemonium vindicatum_. The
same year the University of Halle offered him the degree of doctor in
philosophy. 'His theses, or philosophical positions, which he printed,
ran through several editions in a few weeks.' He was a deep student of
mathematics, and astronomy was his favourite subject. His health broke
down under his studies, and he died in 1740 in the twentieth year of his
age. Johnson's _Works_, vi. 376.

[419] He wrote also in 1756 _A Dissertation on the Epitaphs written by
Pope_.

[420] See _post_, Oct. 16, 1769.

[421] In the original _and_. _Gent. Mag_. x. 464. The title of this poem
as there given is:--'An epitaph upon the celebrated Claudy Philips,
Musician, who died very poor.'

[422] The epitaph of Phillips is in the porch of Wolverhampton Church.
The prose part of it is curious:--

         'Near this place lies
     Charles Claudius Phillips,
   Whose absolute contempt of riches
  and inimitable performances upon the
              violin
  made him the admiration of all that
            knew him.
       He was born in Wales,
      made the tour of Europe,
  and, after the experience of both
        kinds of fortune,
           Died in 1732.'

Mr. Garrick appears not to have recited the verses correctly, the
original being as follows:--

  'Exalted soul, _thy various sounds_ could please
  The love-sick virgin and the gouty ease;
  Could jarring _crowds_, like old Amphion, move
  To beauteous order and harmonious love;
  Rest here in peace, till Angels bid thee rise,
  And meet thy Saviour's _consort_ in the skies.' BLAKEWAY.

_Consort_ is defined in Johnson's _Dictionary_ as _a number of
instruments playing together_.

[423] I have no doubt that it was written in 1741; for the second line
is clearly a parody of a line in the chorus of Cibber's _Birthday Ode_
for that year. The chorus is as follows:

'While thou our Master of the Main
Revives Eliza's glorious reign,
The great Plantagenets look down,
And see _your_ race adorn your crown.'

_Gent. Mag_. xi. 549.

In the _Life of Barretier_ Johnson had also this fling at George
II:--'Princes are commonly the last by whom merit is distinguished.'
Johnson's _Works_, vi. 381.

[424] See Boswell's _Hebrides_, Oct. 23 and Nov. 21, 1773.

[425] Hester Lynch Salusbury, afterwards Mrs. Thrale, and later on Mrs.
Piozzi, was born on Jan. 27, 1741.

[426] This piece is certainly not by Johnson. It contains more than one
ungrammatical passage. It is impossible to believe that he wrote such a
sentence as the following:--'Another having a cask of wine sealed up at
the top, but his servant boring a hole at the bottom stole the greatest
part of it away; sometime after, having called a friend to taste his
wine, he found the vessel almost empty,' &c.

[427] Mr. Carlyle, by the use of the term 'Imaginary Editors'
(_Cromwell's Letters and Speeches_, iii. 229), seems to imply that he
does not hold with Boswell in assigning this piece to Johnson. I am
inclined to think, nevertheless, that Boswell is right. If it is
Johnson's it is doubly interesting as showing the method which he often
followed in writing the Parliamentary Debates. When notes were given
him, while for the most part he kept to the speaker's train of thoughts,
he dealt with the language much as it pleased him. In the _Gent. Mag_.
Cromwell speaks as if he were wearing a flowing wig and were addressing
a Parliament of the days of George II. He is thus made to conclude
Speech xi:--'For my part, could I multiply my person or dilate my power,
I should dedicate myself wholly to this great end, in the prosecution of
which I shall implore the blessing of God upon your counsels and
endeavours.' _Gent. Mag_. xi. 100. The following are the words which
correspond to this in the original:--'If I could help you to many, and
multiply myself into many, that would be to serve you in regard to
settlement.... But I shall pray to God Almighty that He would direct you
to do what is according to His will. And this is that poor account I am
able to give of myself in this thing.' Carlyle's _Cromwell_, iii. 255.

[433] The delivery of letters by the penny-post 'was originally confined
to the cities of London and Westminster, the borough of Southwark and
the respective suburbs thereof.' In 1801 the postage was raised to
twopence. The term 'suburbs' must have had a very limited signification,
for it was not till 1831 that the limits of this delivery were extended
to all places within three miles of the General Post Office. _Ninth
Report of the Commissioners of the Post Office_, 1837, p. 4.

[434] Birch's _MSS. in the British Museum_, 4302. BOSWELL.

[435] See _post_, Dec. 1784, in Nichols's _Anecdotes_. If we may trust
Hawkins, it is likely that Johnson's 'tenderness of conscience' cost
Cave a good deal; for he writes that, while Johnson composed the
_Debates_, the sale of the _Magazine_ increased from ten to fifteen
thousand copies a month. 'Cave manifested his good fortune by buying an
old coach and a pair of older horses.' Hawkins's _Johnson_, P. 123.

[436] I am assured that the editor is Mr. George Chalmers, whose
commercial works are well known and esteemed. BOSWELL.

[437] The characteristic of Pulteney's oratory is thus given in Hazlitts
_Northcole's Conversations_ (p. 288):--'Old Mr. Tolcher used to say of
the famous Pulteney--"My Lord Bath always speaks in blank verse."'

[438] Hawkins's _Life of Johnson_, p. 100. BOSWELL.

[439] A bookseller of London. BOSWELL

[440] Not the Royal Society; but the Society for the encouragement of
learning, of which Dr. Birch was a leading member. Their object was to
assist authors in printing expensive works. It existed from about 1735
to 1746, when having incurred a considerable debt, it was
dissolved. BOSWELL.

[441] There is no erasure here, but a mere blank; to fill up which may
be an exercise for ingenious conjecture. BOSWELL.

[442] Johnson, writing to Dr. Taylor on June 10, 1742, says:--'I propose
to get _Charles of Sweden_ ready for this winter, and shall therefore,
as I imagine, be much engaged for some months with the dramatic writers
into whom I have scarcely looked for many years. Keep _Irene_ close, you
may send it back at your leisure.' _Notes and Queries_, 6th S., v. 303.
_Charles of Sweden_ must have been a play which he projected.

[443] The profligate sentiment was, that 'to tell a secret to a friend
is no breach of fidelity, because the number of persons trusted is not
multiplied, a man and his friend being virtually the same.'
_Rambler_, No. 13.

[445] This piece contains a passage in honour of some great critic. 'May
the shade, at least, of one great English critick rest without
disturbance; and may no man presume to insult his memory, who wants his
learning, his reason, or his wit.' Johnson's _Works_, v. 182. Bentley
had died on July 14 of this year, and there can be little question that
Bentley is meant.

[446] See _post_, end of 1744.

[447] 'There is nothing to tell, dearest lady, but that he was insolent
and I beat him, and that he was a blockhead and told of it, which I
should never have done.... I have beat many a fellow, but the rest had
the wit to hold their tongues.' Piozzi's _Anec_. p. 233. In the _Life of
Pope_ Johnson thus mentions Osborne:--'Pope was ignorant enough of his
own interest to make another change, and introduced Osborne contending
for the prize among the booksellers [_Dunciad_, ii. 167]. Osborne was a
man entirely destitute of shame, without sense of any disgrace but that
of poverty.... The shafts of satire were directed equally in vain
against Cibber and Osborne; being repelled by the impenetrable impudence
of one, and deadened by the impassive dulness of the other.' Johnson's
_Works_, viii. 302.

[448] In the original _contentions_.

[449] 'Dec. 21, 1775. In the Paper Office there is a wight, called
Thomas Astle, who lives like moths on old parchments.' Walpole's
_Letters_, vi. 299.

[450] Savage died on Aug. 1, 1743, so that this letter is misplaced.

[451] The Plain Dealer was published in 1724, and contained some account
of Savage. BOSWELL.

[452] In the _Gent. Mag_. for Sept. 1743 (p. 490) there is an epitaph on
R----d S----e, Esq., which may perhaps be this inscription. 'His life
was want,' this epitaph declares. It is certainly not the Runick
Inscription in the number for March 1742, as Malone suggests; for the
earliest possible date of this letter is seventeen months later.

[453] I have not discovered what this was. BOSWELL.

[454] The _Mag.-Extraordinary_ is perhaps the Supplement to the December
number of each year.

[455] This essay contains one sentiment eminently Johnsonian. The writer
had shown how patiently Confucius endured extreme indigence. He
adds:--'This constancy cannot raise our admiration after his former
conquest of himself; for how easily may he support pain who has been
able to resist pleasure.' _Gent. Mag_. xii. 355.

[456] In this Preface there is a complaint that has been often
repeated--'All kinds of learning have given way to politicks.'

[457] In the _Life of Pope_ (Johnson's _Works_, viii. 287) Johnson says
that Crousaz, 'however little known or regarded here, was no mean
antagonist'

[458] It is not easy to believe that Boswell had read this essay, for
there is nothing metaphysical in what Johnson wrote. Two-thirds of the
paper are a translation from Crousaz. Boswell does not seem to have
distinguished between Crousaz's writings and Johnson's. We have here a
striking instance of the way in which Cave sometimes treated his
readers. One-third of this essay is given in the number for March, the
rest in the number for November.

[459]

Angliacas inter pulcherrima Laura puellas,
  Mox uteri pondus depositura grave,
Adsit, Laura, tibi facilis Lucina dolenti,
  Neve tibi noceat praenituisse Deae.

Mr. Hector was present when this Epigram was made _impromptu_. The first
line was proposed by Dr. James, and Johnson was called upon by the
company to finish it, which he instantly did. BOSWELL. Macaulay
(_Essays_, i. 364) criticises Mr. Croker's criticism of this epigram.

[460] The lines with which this poem is introduced seem to show that it
cannot be Johnson's. He was not the man to allow that haste of
performance was any plea for indulgence. They are as follows:--'Though
several translations of Mr. Pope's verses on his Grotto have already
appeared, we hope that the following attempt, which, we are assured, was
the casual amusement of half an hour during several solicitations to
proceed, will neither be unacceptable to our readers, nor (these
circumstances considered) dishonour the persons concerned by a hasty
publication.' _Gent. Mag_. xiii. 550.

[461] See _Gent. Mag_. xiii. 560. I doubt whether this advertisement be
from Johnson's hand. It is very unlikely that he should make the
advertiser in one and the same paragraph when speaking of himself use
_us_ and _mine_. Boswell does not mention the Preface to vol. iii. of
the _Harkian Catalogue_. It is included in Johnson's _Works_ (v. 198).
Its author, be he who he may, in speaking of literature, says:--'I have
idly hoped to revive a taste well-nigh extinguished.'

[462] Johnson did not speak equally well of Dr. James's morals. 'He will
not,' he wrote, 'pay for three box tickets which he took. It is a
strange fellow.' The tickets were no doubt for Miss Williams's benefit
(Croker's _Boswell_, 8vo. p. 101). See _ante_, p. 81, and _post_, March
28, 1776, end of 1780, note.

[463] See _post_, April 5, 1776.

[464] 'TO DR. MEAD.

'SIR,

'That the _Medicinal Dictionary_ is dedicated to you, is to be imputed
only to your reputation for superior skill in those sciences which I
have endeavoured to explain and facilitate: and you are, therefore, to
consider this address, if it be agreeable to you, as one of the rewards
of merit; and if, otherwise, as one of the inconveniences of eminence.

'However you shall receive it, my design cannot be disappointed; because
this publick appeal to your judgement will shew that I do not found my
hopes of approbation upon the ignorance of my readers, and that I fear
his censure least, whose knowledge is most extensive.

'I am, Sir,

'Your most obedient

'humble servant,

'R. JAMES.'

BOSWELL. See _post_, May 16, 1778, where Johnson said, 'Dr. Mead lived
more in the broad sunshine of life than almost any man.'

[465] Johnson was used to speak of him in this manner:--'Tom is a lively
rogue; he remembers a great deal, and can tell many pleasant stories;
but a pen is to Tom a torpedo, the touch of it benumbs his hand and his
brain.' Hawkins's _Johnson_, p. 209. Goldsmith in his _Life of Nash_
(Cunningham's _Goldsmith's Works_, iv. 54) says:--'Nash was not born a
writer, for whatever humour he might have in conversation, he used to
call a pen his torpedo; whenever he grasped it, it benumbed all his
faculties.' It is very likely that Nash borrowed this saying from
Johnson. In Boswell's _Hebrides_, Sept. 24, 1773, we read:--Dr. Birch
being mentioned, Dr. Johnson said he had more anecdotes than any man. I
said, Percy had a great many; that he flowed with them like one of the
brooks here. JOHNSON. "If Percy is like one of the brooks here, Birch
was like the River Thames. Birch excelled Percy in that as much as Percy
excels Goldsmith." Disraeli (_Curiosities of Literature_, iii, 425)
describes Dr. Birch as 'one to whom British history stands more indebted
than to any superior author. He has enriched the British Museum by
thousands of the most authentic documents of genuine secret history.'

[466] _Ante_, p. 140.

[467] In 1761 Mr. John Levett was returned for Lichfield, but on
petition was declared to be not duly elected (_Parl. Hist_. xv. 1088).
Perhaps he was already aiming at public life.

[468] One explanation may be found of Johnson's intimacy with Savage and
with other men of loose character. 'He was,' writes Hawkins, 'one of the
most quick-sighted men I ever knew in discovering the good and amiable
qualities of others' (Hawkins's _Johnson_, p. 50). 'He was,' says
Boswell (_post_, April 13, 1778), 'willing to take men as they are,
imperfect, and with a mixture of good and bad qualities.' How intimate
the two men were is shown by the following passage in Johnson's _Life of
Savage_:--'Savage left London in July, 1739, having taken leave with
great tenderness of his friends, and parted from the author of this
narrative with tears in his eyes.' Johnson's _Works_, viii. 173.

[469] As a specimen of his temper, I insert the following letter from
him to a noble Lord, to whom he was under great obligations, but who, on
account of his bad conduct, was obliged to discard him. The original was
in the hands of the late Francis Cockayne Cust, Esq., one of His
Majesty's Counsel learned in the law:

'_Right Honourable_ BRUTE, _and_ BOOBY,

'I find you want (as Mr. ---- is pleased to hint,) to swear away my
life, that is, the life of your creditor, because he asks you for a
debt.--The publick shall soon be acquainted with this, to judge whether
you are not fitter to be an Irish Evidence, than to be an Irish Peer.--I
defy and despise you.

'I am,

'Your determined adversary,

'R. S.'

BOSWELL. The noble Lord was no doubt Lord Tyrconnel. See Johnson's
_Works_, viii. 140. Mr. Cust is mentioned _post_, p. 170.

[470] 'Savage took all opportunities of conversing familiarly with those
who were most conspicuous at that time for their power or their
influence; he watched their looser moments, and examined their domestic
behaviour with that acuteness which nature had given him, and which the
uncommon variety of his life had contributed to increase, and that
inquisitiveness which must always be produced in a vigorous mind by an
absolute freedom from all pressing or domestic engagements.' Johnson's
_Works_, viii. 135.

[471] 'Thus he spent his time in mean expedients and tormenting
suspense, living for the greatest part in the fear of prosecutions from
his creditors, and consequently skulking in obscure parts of the town,
of which he was no stranger to the remotest corners.' _Ib_. p. 165.

[472] Sir John Hawkins gives the world to understand, that Johnson,
'being an admirer of genteel manners, was captivated by the address and
demeanour of Savage, who, as to his exterior, was, to a remarkable
degree, accomplished.' Hawkins's _Life_, p. 52. But Sir John's notions
of gentility must appear somewhat ludicrous, from his stating the
following circumstance as presumptive evidence that Savage was a good
swordsman: 'That he understood the exercise of a gentleman's weapon, may
be inferred from the use made of it in that rash encounter which is
related in his life.' The dexterity here alluded to was, that Savage, in
a nocturnal fit of drunkenness, stabbed a man at a coffee-house, and
killed him; for which he was tried at the Old-Bailey, and found guilty
of murder.

Johnson, indeed, describes him as having 'a grave and manly deportment,
a solemn dignity of mien; but which, upon a nearer acquaintance,
softened into an engaging easiness of manners.' [Johnson's _Works_,
viii. 187.] How highly Johnson admired him for that knowledge which he
himself so much cultivated, and what kindness he entertained for him,
appears from the following lines in the _Gentleman's Magazine_ for
April, 1738, which I am assured were written by Johnson:

_'Ad_ RICARDUM SAVAGE.

'Humani studium generis cui pectore
  fervet
O colat humanum te foveatque
  genus.'

BOSWELL. The epigram is inscribed Ad Ricardum Savage, Arm. Humani
Generis Amatorem. _Gent. Mag_. viii. 210.

[473] The following striking proof of Johnson's extreme indigence, when
he published the _Life of Savage_, was communicated to the author, by
Mr. Richard Stow, of Apsley, in Bedfordshire, from the information of
Mr. Walter Harte, author of the _Life of Gustavus Adolphus_:

'Soon after Savage's _Life_ was published, Mr. Harte dined with Edward
Cave, and occasionally praised it. Soon after, meeting him, Cave said,
'You made a man very happy t'other day.'--'How could that be,' says
Harte; 'nobody was there but ourselves.' Cave answered, by reminding him
that a plate of victuals was sent behind a screen, which was to Johnson,
dressed so shabbily, that he did not choose to appear; but on hearing
the conversation, was highly delighted with the encomiums on his book.'
MALONE. 'He desired much to be alone, yet he always loved good talk, and
often would get behind the screen to hear it.' Great-Heart's account of
Fearing; _Pilgrim's Progress_, Part II. Harte was tutor to Lord
Chesterfield's son. See _post_, 1770, in Dr. Maxwell's _Collectanea_,
and March 30, 1781.

[474] 'Johnson has told me that whole nights have been spent by him and
Savage in a perambulation round the squares of Westminster, St. James's
in particular, when all the money they could both raise was less than
sufficient to purchase for them the shelter and sordid comforts of a
night's cellar.' Hawkins's _Johnson_, P. 53. Where was Mrs. Johnson
living at this time? This perhaps was the time of which Johnson wrote,
when, after telling of a silver cup which his mother had bought him, and
marked SAM. I., he says:--'The cup was one of the last pieces of plate
which dear Tetty sold in our distress.' _Account of Johnson's Early
Life_, p. 18. Yet it is not easy to understand how, if there was a
lodging for her, there was not one for him. She might have been living
with friends. We have a statement by Hawkins (p. 89) that there was 'a
temporary separation of Johnson from his wife.' He adds that, 'while he
was in a lodging in Fleet Street, she was harboured by a friend near the
Tower.' This separation, he insinuates, rose by an estrangement caused
by Johnson's 'indifference in the discharge of the domestic virtues.' It
is far more likely that it rose from destitution.

Shenstone, in a letter written in 1743, gives a curious account of the
streets of London through which Johnson wandered. He says;--'London is
really dangerous at this time; the pickpockets, formerly content with
mere filching, make no scruple to knock people down with bludgeons in
Fleet Street and the Strand, and that at no later hour than eight
o'clock at night; but in the Piazzas, Covent Garden, they come in large
bodies, armed with _couteaus_, and attack whole parties, so that the
danger of coming out of the play-houses is of some weight in the
opposite scale, when I am disposed to go to them oftener than I ought.'
Shenstone's _Works_ (edit.), iii. 73.

[475] 'Savage lodged as much by accident as he dined, and passed the
night sometimes in mean houses, ... and sometimes, when he had not money
to support even the expenses of these receptacles, walked about the
streets till he was weary, and lay down in the summer upon a bulk, or in
the winter, with his associates in poverty, among the ashes of a
glass-house. In this manner were passed those days and those nights
which nature had enabled him to have employed in elevated speculations,
useful studies, or pleasing conversation.' Johnson's _Works_, viii. 159.

[476] See _ante_, p. 94.

[477] Cave was the purchaser of the copyright, and the following is a
copy of Johnson's receipt for the money:--'The 14th day of December,
received of Mr. Ed. Cave the sum of fifteen guineas, in full, for
compiling and writing _The Life of Richard Savage, Esq_., deceased; and
in full for all materials thereto applied, and not found by the said
Edward Cave. I say, received by me, SAM. JOHNSON. Dec. 14, 1743.'

P. CUNNINGHAM. Between Savage's character, as drawn by Johnson, and
Johnson himself there are many points of likeness. Each 'always
preserved a steady confidence in his own capacity,' and of each it might
be said:--'Whatever faults may be imputed to him, the virtue of
suffering well cannot be denied him.' Each 'excelled in the arts of
conversation and therefore willingly practised them.' In Savage's
refusal to enter a house till some clothes had been taken away that had
been left for him 'with some neglect of ceremonies,' we have the
counterpart of Johnson's throwing away the new pair of shoes that had
been set at his door. Of Johnson the following lines are as true as of
Savage:--'His distresses, however afflictive, never dejected him; in his
lowest state he wanted not spirit to assert the natural dignity of wit,
and was always ready to repress that insolence which the superiority of
fortune incited; ... he never admitted any gross familiarities, or
submitted to be treated otherwise than as an equal.' Of both men it
might be said that 'it was in no time of his life any part of his
character to be the first of the company that desired to separate.' Each
'would prolong his conversation till midnight, without considering that
business might require his friend's application in the morning;' and
each could plead the same excuse that, 'when he left his company, he was
abandoned to gloomy reflections.' Each had the same 'accurate judgment,'
the same 'quick apprehension,' the same 'tenacious memory.' In reading
such lines as the following who does not think, not of the man whose
biography was written, but of the biographer himself?--'He had the
peculiar felicity that his attention never deserted him; he was present
to every object, and regardful of the most trifling occurrences ... To
this quality is to be imputed the extent of his knowledge, compared with
the small time which he spent in visible endeavours to acquire it. He
mingled in cursory conversation with the same steadiness of attention as
others apply to a lecture.... His judgment was eminently exact both with
regard to writings and to men. The knowledge of life was indeed his
chief attainment.' Of Johnson's _London_, as of Savage's _The Wanderer_,
it might equally well be said:--'Nor can it without some degree of
indignation and concern be told that he sold the copy for ten guineas.'

[485] 'Savage was now again abandoned to fortune without any other
friend than Mr. Wilks; a man who, whatever were his abilities or skill
as an actor, deserves at least to be remembered for his virtues, which
are not often to be found in the world, and perhaps less often in his
profession than in others. To be humane, generous, and candid is a very
high degree of merit in any case, but those qualities deserve still
greater praise when they are found in that condition which makes almost
every other man, for whatever reason, contemptuous, insolent, petulant,
selfish, and brutal.' _Johnson's Works_, viii. 107.

[486] In his old age he wrote as he had written in the vigour of his
manhood:--'To the censure of Collier ... he [Dryden] makes little reply;
being at the age of sixty-eight attentive to better things than the
claps of a play-house.' Johnson's _Works_ vii. 295. See _post_, April
29, 1773, and Sept. 21, 1777.

[487] Johnson, writing of the latter half of the seventeenth century,
says:--'The playhouse was abhorred by the Puritans, and avoided by those
who desired the character of seriousness or decency. A grave lawyer
would have debased his dignity, and a young trader would have impaired
his credit, by appearing in those mansions of dissolute licentiousness.'
Johnson's _Works_, vii. 270. The following lines in Churchill's
_Apology_ (_Poems_, i. 65), published in 1761, shew how strong, even at
that time, was the feeling against strolling players:--

'The strolling tribe, a despicable race,
Like wand'ring Arabs shift from place to place.
Vagrants by law, to Justice open laid,
They tremble, of the beadle's lash afraid,
And fawning cringe, for wretched means of life,
To Madam May'ress, or his Worship's Wife.'

[488] Johnson himself recognises the change in the public
estimation:--'In Dryden's time,' he writes, 'the drama was very far from
that universal approbation which it has now obtained.' _Works_,
vii. 270.

[489] Giffard was the manager of the theatre in Goodman's Fields, where
Garrick, on Oct. 19, 1741, made his first appearance before a London
audience. Murphy's _Garrick_, pp. 13, 16.

[490] 'Colonel Pennington said, Garrick sometimes failed in emphasis;
as, for instance, in Hamlet,

"I will speak _daggers_ to her; but use _none_;"

instead of

"I will _speak_ daggers to her; but _use_ none."'

Boswell's _Hebrides_, Aug. 28, 1773.

[491] I suspect Dr. Taylor was inaccurate in this statement. The
emphasis should be equally upon _shalt_ and _not_, as both concur to
form the negative injunction; and _false witness_, like the other acts
prohibited in the Decalogue, should not be marked by any peculiar
emphasis, but only be distinctly enunciated. BOSWELL.

[492] This character of the _Life of Savage_ was not written by Fielding
as has been supposed, but most probably by Ralph, who, as appears from
the minutes of the partners of _The Champion_, in the possession of Mr.
Reed of Staple Inn, succeeded Fielding in his share of the paper, before
the date of that eulogium. BOSWELL. Ralph is mentioned in _The Dunciad_,
iii. 165. A curious account of him is given in Benjamin Franklin's
_Memoirs_, i. 54-87 and 245.

[493] The late Francis Cockayne Cust, Esq., one of his Majesty's
Counsel. BOSWELL.

[494] Savage's veracity was questioned, but with little reason; his
accounts, though not indeed always the same, were generally consistent.
'When he loved any man, he suppressed all his faults: and, when he had
been offended by him, concealed all his virtues: but his characters were
generally true so far as he proceeded; though it cannot be denied that
his partiality might have sometimes the effect of falsehood.' Johnson's
_Works_, viii. 190.

[495] 1697. BOSWELL.

[496] Johnson's _Works_, viii. 98.

[497] The story on which Mr. Cust so much relies, that Savage was a
supposititious child, not the son of Lord Rivers and Lady Macclesfield,
but the offspring of a shoemaker, introduced in consequence of her real
son's death, was, without doubt, grounded on the circumstance of Lady
Macclesfield having, in 1696, previously to the birth of Savage, had a
daughter by the Earl Rivers, who died in her infancy; a fact which was
proved in the course of the proceedings on Lord Macclesfield's Bill of
Divorce. Most fictions of this kind have some admixture of truth in
them. MALONE. From _The Earl of Macclesfield's Case_, it appears that
'Anne, Countess of Macclesfield, under the name of Madam Smith, in Fox
Court, near Brook Street, Holborn, was delivered of a male child on the
16th of January, 1696-7, who was baptized on the Monday following, the
18th, and registered by the name of Richard, the son of John Smith, by
Mr. Burbridge; and, from the privacy, was supposed by Mr. Burbridge to
be "a by-blow or bastard."' It also appears, that during her delivery,
the lady wore a mask; and that Mary Pegler, on the next day after the
baptism, took a male child, whose mother was called Madam Smith, from
the house of Mrs. Pheasant, in Fox Court [running from Brook Street in
Gray's Inn Lane], who went by the name of Mrs. Lee.

Conformable to this statement is the entry in the register of St.
Andrew's, Holborn, which is as follows, and which unquestionably records
the baptism of Richard Savage, to whom Lord Rivers gave his own
Christian name, prefixed to the assumed surname of his mother:--'Jan.
1696-7. Richard, son of John Smith and Mary, in Fox Court, in Gray's Inn
Lane, baptized the 18th.' BINDLEY. According to Johnson's account Savage
did not learn who his parents were till the death of his nurse, who had
always treated him as her son. Among her papers he found some letters
written by Lady Macclesfield's mother proving his origin. Johnson's
_Works_, viii. 102. Why these letters were not laid before the public is
not stated. Johnson was one of the least credulous of men, and he was
convinced by Savage's story. Horace Walpole, too, does not seem to have
doubted it. Walpole's _Letters_, i. cv.

[498] Johnson's _Works_, viii. 97.

[499] _Ib_. p. 142.

[500] Johnson's _Works_, p. 101.

[501] According to Johnson's account (Johnson's _Works_, viii. 102), the
shoemaker under whom Savage was placed on trial as an apprentice was not
the husband of his nursc.

[502] He was in his tenth year when she died. 'He had none to prosecute
his claim, to shelter him from oppression, or call in law to the
assistance of justice.' _Ib_. p. 99.

[503] Johnson's companion appears to have persuaded that lofty-minded
man, that he resembled him in having a noble pride; for Johnson, after
painting in strong colours the quarrel between Lord Tyrconnel and
Savage, asserts that 'the spirit of Mr. Savage, indeed, never suffered
him to solicit a reconciliation: he returned reproach for reproach, and
insult for insult.' [_Ib_. p. 141.] But the respectable gentleman to
whom I have alluded, has in his possession a letter, from Savage, after
Lord Tyrconnel had discarded him, addressed to the Reverend Mr. Gilbert,
his Lordship's Chaplain, in which he requests him, in the humblest
manner, to represent his case to the Viscount. BOSWELL.

[504] 'How loved, how honoured once avails thee not, To whom related, or
by whom begot.'

POPE'S _Elegy to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady_.

[505] Trusting to Savage's information, Johnson represents this unhappy
man's being received as a companion by Lord Tyrconnel, and pensioned by
his Lordship, as if posteriour to Savage's conviction and pardon. But I
am assured, that Savage had received the voluntary bounty of Lord
Tyrconnel, and had been dismissed by him, long before the murder was
committed, and that his Lordship was very instrumental in procuring
Savage's pardon, by his intercession with the Queen, through Lady
Hertford. If, therefore, he had been desirous of preventing the
publication by Savage, he would have left him to his fate. Indeed I must
observe, that although Johnson mentions that Lord Tyrconnel's patronage
of Savage was 'upon his promise to lay aside his design of exposing the
cruelty of his mother,' [Johnson's _Works_, viii. 124], the great
biographer has forgotten that he himself has mentioned, that Savage's
story had been told several years before in _The Plain Dealer_; from
which he quotes this strong saying of the generous Sir Richard Steele,
that 'the inhumanity of his mother had given him a right to find every
good man his father.' [_Ib_. p. 104.] At the same time it must be
acknowledged, that Lady Macclesfield and her relations might still wish
that her story should not be brought into more conspicuous notice by the
satirical pen of Savage. BOSWELL.

[506] According to Johnson, she was at Bath when Savage's poem of _The
Bastard_ was published. 'She could not,' he wrote, 'enter the
assembly-rooms or cross the walks without being saluted with some lines
from _The Bastard_. This was perhaps the first time that she ever
discovered a sense of shame, and on this occasion the power of wit was
very conspicuous; the wretch who had without scruple proclaimed herself
an adulteress, and who had first endeavoured to starve her son, then to
transport him, and afterwards to hang him, was not able to bear the
representation of her own conduct; but fled from reproach, though she
felt no pain from guilt, and left Bath with the utmost haste to shelter
herself among the crowds of London.' Johnson's _Works_, viii. 141.

[507] Miss Mason, after having forfeited the title of Lady Macclesfield
by divorce, was married to Colonel Brett, and, it is said, was well
known in all the polite circles. Colley Cibber, I am informed, had so
high an opinion of her taste and judgement as to genteel life, and
manners, that he submitted every scene of his _Careless Husband_ to Mrs.
Brett's revisal and correction. Colonel Brett was reported to be too
free in his gallantry with his Lady's maid. Mrs. Brett came into a room
one day in her own house, and found the Colonel and her maid both fast
asleep in two chairs. She tied a white handkerchief round her husband's
neck, which was a sufficient proof that she had discovered his intrigue;
but she never at any time took notice of it to him. This incident, as I
am told, gave occasion to the well-wrought scene of Sir Charles and Lady
Easy and Edging. BOSWELL. Lady Macclesfield died 1753, aged above 80.
Her eldest daughter, by Col. Brett, was, for the few last months of his
life, the mistress of George I, (Walpole's _Reminiscences_, cv.) Her
marriage ten years after her royal lover's death is thus announced in
the _Gent. Mag_., 1737:--'Sept. 17. Sir W. Leman, of Northall, Bart., to
Miss Brett [Britt] of Bond Street, an heiress;' and again next
month--'Oct. 8. Sir William Leman, of Northall, Baronet, to Miss Brett,
half sister to Mr. Savage, son to the late Earl Rivers;' for the
difference of date I know not how to account; but the second insertion
was, no doubt, made by Savage to countenance his own pretensions. CROKER.

[508] 'Among the names of subscribers to the _Harleian Miscellany_ there
occurs that of "Sarah Johnson, bookseller in Lichfield."'
_Johnsoniana_, p. 466.

[509] A brief account of Oldys is given in the _Gent. Mag_. liv. 161,
260. Like so many of his fellows he was thrown into the Fleet. 'After
poor Oldys's release, such was his affection for the place that he
constantly spent his evenings there.'

[510] In the Feb. number of the _Gent. Mag_. for this year (p. 112) is
the following advertisement:--'Speedily will be published (price 1s.)
_Miscellaneous Observations on the Tragedy of Macbeth_, with remarks on
Sir T.H.'s edition of _Shakespear_; to which is affix'd proposals for a
new edition of _Shakespear_, with a specimen. Printed for J. Roberts in
Warwick Lane.' In the March number (p. 114), under the date of March 31,
it is announced that it will be published on April 6. In spite of the
two advertisements, and the title-page which agrees with the
advertisements, I believe that the Proposals were not published till
eleven years later (see _post_, end of 1756). I cannot hear of any copy
of the _Miscellaneous Observations_ which contains them. The
advertisement is a third time repeated in the April number of the _Gent.
Mag_. for 1745 (p. 224), but the Proposals are not this time mentioned.
Tom Davies the bookseller gives 1756 as the date of their publication
(_Misc. and Fugitive Pieces_, ii. 87). Perhaps Johnson or the
booksellers were discouraged by Hanmer's _Shakespeare_ as well as by
Warburton's. Johnson at the end of the _Miscellaneous Observations_
says:--'After the foregoing pages were printed, the late edition of
_Shakespeare_ ascribed to Sir T. H. fell into my hands.'

[511] 'The excellence of the edition proved to be by no means
proportionate to the arrogance of the editor.' _Cambridge
Shakespeare_, i. xxxiv.

[512] 'When you see Mr. Johnson pray [give] my compliments, and tell him
I esteem him as a great genius--quite lost both to himself and the
world.' _Gilbert Walmesley to Garrick_, Nov. 3, 1746. _Garrick
Correspondence_, i. 45. Mr. Walmesley's letter does not shew that
Johnson was idle. The old man had expected great things from him. 'I
have great hopes,' he had written in 1737 (see _ante_, p. 102), 'that he
will turn out a fine tragedy writer.' In the nine years in which Johnson
had been in town he had done, no doubt, much admirable work; but by his
poem of _London_ only was he known to the public. His _Life of Savage_
did not bear his name. His _Observations on Macbeth_ were published in
April, 1745; his _Plan of the Dictionary_ in 1747 [Transcriber's note:
Originally 1774, corrected in Errata.]. What was Johnson doing
meanwhile? Boswell conjectures that he was engaged on his _Shakespeare_
and his _Dictionary_. That he went on working at his _Shakespeare_ when
the prospect of publishing was so remote that he could not issue his
proposals is very unlikely. That he had been for some time engaged on
his _Dictionary_ before he addressed Lord Chesterfield is shewn by the
opening sentences of the _Plan_. Mr. Croker's conjecture that he was
absent or concealed on account of some difficulties which had arisen
through the rebellion of 1745 is absurd. At no time of his life had he
been an ardent Jacobite. 'I have heard him declare,' writes Boswell,
'that if holding up his right hand would have secured victory at
Culloden to Prince Charles's army, he was not sure he would have held it
up;' _post_, July 14, 1763. 'He had never in his life been in a
nonjuring meeting-house;' _post_, June 9, 1784.

For the fact that he wrote very little, if indeed anything, in the
_Gent. Mag_. during these years more than one reason may be given. In
the first place, public affairs take up an unusual amount of room in its
columns. Thus in the number for Dec. 1745 we read:--'Our readers being
too much alarmed by the present rebellion to relish with their usual
delight the _Debates in the Senate of Lilliput_ we shall postpone them
for a season, that we may be able to furnish out a fuller entertainment
of what we find to be more suitable to their present taste.' In the
Preface it is stated:--'We have sold more of our books than we desire
for several months past, and are heartily sorry for the occasion of it,
the present troubles.' During these years then much less space was given
to literature. But besides this, Johnson likely enough refused to write
for the _Magazine_ when it shewed itself strongly Hanoverian. He would
highly disapprove of _A New Protestant Litany_, which was written after
the following fashion:--

'May Spaniards, or French, all who join with a Highland,
In disturbing the peace of this our bless'd island,
Meet tempests on sea and halters on dry land.
    We beseech Thee to hear us, good Lord.'

_Gent. Mag_. xv. 551.

He would be disgusted the following year at seeing the Duke of
Cumberland praised as 'the greatest man alive' (_Gent. Mag_. xvi. 235),
and sung in verse that would have almost disgraced Cibber (p. 36). It is
remarkable that there is no mention of Johnson's _Plan of a Dictionary_
in the _Magazine_. Perhaps some coolness had risen between him and Cave.

[513] Boswell proceeds to mention six.

[514] In Mrs. Williams's Miscellanies, in which this paraphrase is
inserted, it is stated that the Latin epitaph was written by Dr. Freind.
I do not think that the English version is by Johnson. I should be sorry
to ascribe to him such lines as:--

'Illustrious age! how bright thy glories shone,
When Hanmer filled the chair--and Anne the throne.'

[515] In the _Observations_, Johnson, writing of Hanmer, says:--'Surely
the weapons of criticism ought not to be blunted against an editor who
can imagine that he is restoring poetry while he is amusing himself with
alterations like these:--

For,--This is the sergeant
  Who like a good and hardy soldier fought;
--This is the sergeant who
  Like a _right_ good and hardy soldier fought.

Such harmless industry may surely be forgiven, if it cannot be praised;
may he therefore never want a monosyllable who can use it with such
wonderful dexterity.' Johnson's _Works_, v. 93. In his Preface to
_Shakespeare_ published eighteen years later, he describes Hanmer as 'A
man, in my opinion, eminently qualified by nature for such studies.'
_Ib_. p. 139. The editors of the _Cambridge Shakespeare_ (i. xxxii) thus
write of Hanmer:--

'A country gentleman of great ingenuity and lively fancy, but with no
knowledge of older literature, no taste for research, and no ear for the
rhythm of earlier English verse, amused his leisure hours by scribbling
down his own and his friend's guesses in Pope's _Shakespeare_.'

[516] In the _Universal Visiter_, to which Johnson contributed, the mark
which is affixed to some pieces unquestionably his, is also found
subjoined to others, of which he certainly was not the author. The mark
therefore will not ascertain the poems in question to have been written
by him. They were probably the productions of Hawkesworth, who, it is
believed, was afflicted with the gout. MALONE.

It is most unlikely that Johnson wrote such poor poems as thesc. I shall
not easily be persuaded that the following lines are his:--

'Love warbles in the vocal groves,
  And vegetation paints the plain.'

'And love and hate alike implore
  The skies--"That Stella mourn no more."'

'The Winter's Walk' has two good lines, but these may have been supplied
by Johnson. The lines to 'Lyce, an elderly Lady,' would, if written by
him, have been taken as a satire on his wife.

[517] See _post_ under Sept. 18, 1783.

[518] See Johnson's _Works_, vii. 4, 34.

[519] Boswell italicises _conceits_ to shew that he is using it in the
sense in which Johnson uses it in his criticism of Cowley:--'These
conceits Addison calls mixed wit; that is, wit which consists of
thoughts true in one sense of the expression and false in the other.'
_Ib_. vii 35.

[520] _Namby Pamby_ was the name given to Ambrose Philips by Pope _Ib_.
viii. 395

[521] Malone most likely is meant. Mr. Croker says:--'Johnson has
"_indifferently_" in the sense of "_without concern_" in his
_Dictionary_, with this example from _Shakespeare_, "And I will look on
death indifferently."' Johnson however here defines indifferently as _in
a neutral state; without wish or aversion_; which is not the same as
_without concern_. The passage, which is from _Julius Caesar_, i. 2, is
not correctly given. It is--

'Set honour in one eye and death
i' the other
And I will look on both indifferently.'

We may compare Johnson's use of _indifferent_ in his Letter to
Chesterfield, _post_, Feb. 7, 1755:--'The notice which you have been
pleased to take of my labours ... has been delayed till I am
indifferent, and cannot enjoy it.'

[522] 'Radcliffe, when quite a boy, had been engaged in the rebellion of
1715, and being attainted had escaped from Newgate.... During the
insurrection [of 1745], having been captured on board a French vessel
bound for Scotland, he was arraigned on his original sentence which had
slumbered so long. The only trial now conceded to him was confined to
his identity. For such a course there was no precedent, except in the
case of Sir Walter Raleigh, which had brought shame upon the reign of
James I.' Campbell's _Chancellors_ (edit. 1846), v. 108. Campbell adds,
'his execution, I think, reflects great disgrace upon Lord Hardwicke
[the Lord Chancellor].'

[523] In the original _end_.

[524] "These verses are somewhat too severe on the extraordinary person
who is the chief figure in them, for he was undoubtedly brave. His
pleasantry during his solemn trial (in which, by the way, I have heard
Mr. David Hume observe, that we have one of the very few speeches of Mr.
Murray, now Earl of Mansfield, authentically given) was very remarkable.
When asked if he had any questions to put to Sir Everard Fawkener, who
was one of the strongest witnesses against him, he answered, 'I only
wish him joy of his young wife.' And after sentence of death, in the
horrible terms in cases of treason, was pronounced upon him, and he was
retiring from the bar, he said, 'Fare you well, my Lords, we shall not
all meet again in one place.' He behaved with perfect composure at his
execution, and called out '_Dulce et decorum est pro patriâ mori_?'

'What joys, what glories round him wait,
Who bravely for his country dies!"

FRANCIS. Horace, _Odes_, iii.2. 13.

BOSWELL.

'Old Lovat was beheaded yesterday,' wrote Horace Walpole on April 10,
1747, 'and died extremely well: without passion, affectation,
buffoonery, or timidity; his behaviour was natural and intrepid.'
_Letters_, ii. 77.

[525] See _post_, 1780, in Mr. Langton's _Collection_.

[526] My friend, Mr. Courtenay, whose eulogy on Johnson's Latin Poetry
has been inserted in this Work [_ante_, p. 62], is no less happy in
praising his English Poetry.

But hark, he sings! the strain ev'n Pope admires;
Indignant virtue her own bard inspires.
Sublime as juvenal he pours his lays,
And with the Roman shares congenial praise;--
In glowing numbers now he fires the age,
And Shakspeare's sun relumes the clouded stage.

BOSWELL.

[527] The play is by Ambrose Philips. 'It was concluded with the most
successful Epilogue that was ever yet spoken on the English theatre. The
three first nights it was recited twice; and not only continued to be
demanded through the run, as it is termed, of the play; but, whenever it
is recalled to the stage, where by peculiar fortune, though a copy from
the French, it yet keeps its place, the Epilogue is still expected, and
is still spoken.' Johnson's _Works_, viii. 389. See _post_, April 21,
1773, note on Eustace Budgel. The Epilogue is given in vol. v. p. 228 of
Bonn's _Addison_, and the great success that it met with is described in
_The Spectator_, No. 341.

[528] Such poor stuff as the following is certainly not by Johnson:--

'Let musick sound the voice of joy!
  Or mirth repeat the jocund tale;
Let Love his wanton wiles employ,
  And o'er the season wine prevail.'

[529] 'Dodsley first mentioned to me the scheme of an English
Dictionary; but I had long thought of it.' _Post_, Oct. 10, 1779.

[530] It would seem from the passage to which Boswell refers that Pope
had wished that Johnson should undertake the _Dictionary_. Johnson, in
mentioning Pope, says:--'Of whom I may be justified in affirming that
were he still alive, solicitous as he was for the success of this work,
he would not be displeased that I have undertaken it.' _Works_, v. 20.
As Pope died on May 30, 1744, this renders it likely that the work was
begun earlier than Boswell thought.

[531] In the title-page of the first edition after the name of Hirch
comes that of L. Hawes.

[532] 'During the progress of the work he had received at different
times the amount of his contract; and when his receipts were produced to
him at a tavern-dinner given by the booksellers, it appeared that he had
been paid a hundred pounds and upwards more than his due.' Murphy's
_Johnson_. p. 78. See _post_, beginning of 1756.

[533] 'The truth is, that the several situations which I have been in
having made me long the _plastron_ [butt] of dedications, I am become as
callous to flattery as some people are to abusc.' Lord Chesterfield,
date of Dec. 15, 1755; Chesterfield's _Misc. Works_, iv. 266.

Islam. BOSWELL.

[535] Boswell here says too much, as the following passages in the
_Plan_ prove:--'Who upon this survey can forbear to wish that these
fundamental atoms of our speech might obtain the firmness and
immutability of the primogenial and constituent particles of matter?'
'Those translators who, for want of understanding the characteristical
difference of tongues, have formed a chaotick dialect of heterogeneous
phrases;' 'In one part refinement will be subtilised beyond exactness,
and evidence dilated in another beyond perspicuity.' Johnson's _Works_,
v. 12, 21, 22.

[536] Ausonius, _Epigram_ i. 12.

[537] Whitehead in 1757 succeeded Colley Cibber as poet-laureate, and
dying in 1785 was followed by Thomas Warton. From Warton the line of
succession is Pye, Southey, Wordsworth, Tennyson. See _post_, under
June 13, 1763.

[538] Hawkins (_Life_, p. 176) likewise says that the manuscript passed
through Whitehead and 'other hands' before it reached Chesterfield. Mr.
Croker had seen 'a draft of the prospectus carefully written by an
amanuensis, but signed in great form by Johnson's own hand. It was
evidently that which was laid before Lord Chesterfield. Some useful
remarks are made in his lordship's hand, and some in another. Johnson
adopted all these suggestions.'

[539] This poor piece of criticism confirms what Johnson said of Lord
Orrery:--'He grasped at more than his abilities could reach; tried to
pass for a better talker, a better writer, and a better thinker that he
was.' Boswell's _Hebrides_, Sept. 22, 1773. See _post_, under April
7, 1778.

[541] 'When I survey the _Plan_ which I have laid before you, I cannot,
my Lord, but confess that I am frighted at its extent, and, like the
soldiers of Cæsar, look on Britain as a new world, which it is almost
madness to invade.' Johnson's _Works_, v. 21.

[542] There might be applied to him what he said of
Pope:--"Self-confidence is the first requisite to great undertakings.
He, indeed, who forms his opinion of himself in solitude without knowing
the powers of other men, is very liable to error; but it was the
felicity of Pope to rate himself at his real value." Johnson's _Works_,
viii, 237.

[543] 'For the Teutonick etymologies I am commonly indebted to Junius
and Skinner.... Junius appears to have excelled in extent of learning
and Skinner in rectitude of understanding.... Skinner is often ignorant,
but never ridiculous: Junius is always full of knowledge, but his
variety distracts his judgment, and his learning is very frequently
disgraced by his absurdities.' _Ib_. v. 29. Francis Junius the younger
was born at Heidelberg in 1589, and died at Windsor, at the house of his
nephew Isaac Vossius, in 1678. His _Etymologicum Anglicanum_ was not
published till 1743. Stephen Skinner, M.D., was born in 1623, and died
in 1667. His _Etymologicon Linguæ Anglicanæ_ was published in 1671.

British proverbs.

[546] 'The faults of the book resolve themselves, for the most part,
into one great fault. Johnson was a wretched etymologist.' Macaulay's
_Misc. Writings_, p. 382. See _post_, May 13, 1778, for mention of Horne
Tooke's criticism of Johnson's etymologies.

[547] 'The etymology, so far as it is yet known, was easily found in the
volumes where it is particularly and professedly delivered ... But to
COLLECT the WORDS of our language was a task of greater difficulty: the
deficiency of dictionaries was immediately apparent; and when they were
exhausted, what was yet wanting must be sought by fortuitous and
unguided excursions into books, and gleaned as industry should find, or
chance should offer it, in the boundless chaos of a living speech.'
Johnson's _Works_, v. 31.

[548] See _post_, under April 10, 1776. BOSWELL.

[549] 'Mr. Macbean,' said Johnson in 1778, 'is a man of great learning,
and for his learning I respect him, and I wish to serve him. He knows
many languages, and knows them well; but he knows nothing of life. I
advised him to write a geographical dictionary; but I have lost all
hopes of his ever doing anything properly, since I found he gave as much
labour to Capua as to Rome.' Mme. D'Arblay's _Diary_, i, 114. See _post_
beginning of 1773, and Oct 24, 1780.

[550] Boswell is speaking of the book published under the name of
_Cibber_ mentioned above, but 'entirely compiled,' according to Johnson,
by Shiels. See _post_, April 10, 1776.

[551] See _Piozzi Letters_, i. 312, and _post_, May 21, 1775, note.

[552] 'We ourselves, not without labour and risk, lately discovered
Gough Square.... and on the second day of search the very House there,
wherein the _English Dictionary_ was composed. It is the first or corner
house on the right hand, as you enter through the arched way from the
North-west ... It is a stout, old-fashioned, oak-balustraded house: "I
have spent many a pound and penny on it since then," said the worthy
Landlord: "here, you see, this bedroom was the Doctor's study; that was
the garden" (a plot of delved ground somewhat larger than a bed-quilt)
"where he walked for exercise; these three garret bedrooms" (where his
three [six] copyists sat and wrote) "were the place he kept
his--_pupils_ in": _Tempus edax rerum!_ Yet _ferax_ also: for our friend
now added, with a wistful look, which strove to seem merely historical:
"I let it all in lodgings, to respectable gentlemen; by the quarter or
the month; it's all one to me."--"To me also," whispered the ghost of
Samuel, as we went pensively our ways.' Carlyle's _Miscellanies_, edit,
of 1872, iv. 112.

[553] Boswell's account of the manner in which Johnson compiled his
_Dictionary_ is confused and erroneous. He began his task (as he himself
expressly described to me), by devoting his first care to a diligent
perusal of all such English writers as were most correct in their
language, and under every sentence which he meant to quote he drew a
line, and noted in the margin the first letter of the word under which
it was to occur. He then delivered these books to his clerks, who
transcribed each sentence on a separate slip of paper, and arranged the
same under the word referred to. By these means he collected the several
words and their different significations; and when the whole arrangement
was alphabetically formed, he gave the definitions of their meanings,
and collected their etymologies from Skinner, Junius, and other writers
on the subject. PERCY.

[554] 'The books he used for this purpose were what he had in his own
collection, a copious but a miserably ragged one, and all such as he
could borrow; which latter, if ever they came back to those that lent
them, were so defaced as to be scarce worth owning, and yet some of his
friends were glad to receive and entertain them as curiosities.'
Hawkins, p. 175.

[555] In the copy that he thus marked of Sir Matthew Hale's _Primitive
Origination of Mankind_, opposite the passage where it is stated, that
'Averroes says that if the world were not eternal ... it could never
have been at all, because an eternal duration must necessarily have
anteceded the first production of the world,' he has written:--'This
argument will hold good equally against the writing that I now write.'

[556] Boswell must mean 'whose writings _taken as a whole_ had a
tendency,' &c. Johnson quotes Dryden, and of Dryden he says:--'Of the
mind that can trade in corruption, and can deliberately pollute itself
with ideal wickedness for the sake of spreading the contagion in
society, I wish not to conceal or excuse the depravity. Such degradation
of the dignity of genius, such abuse of superlative abilities, cannot be
contemplated but with grief and indignation. What consolation can be had
Dryden has afforded by living to repent, and to testify his repentance.'
Johnson's _Works_, vii. 293. He quotes Congreve, and of Congreve he
says: 'It is acknowledged, with universal conviction, that the perusal
of his works will make no man better; and that their ultimate effect is
to represent pleasure in alliance with vice, and to relax those
obligations by which life ought to be regulated.' _Ib_. viii. 28. He
would not quote Dr. Clarke, much as he admired him, because he was not
sound upon the doctrine of the Trinity. _Post_, Dec., 1784, note.

[557] In the _Plan to the Dictionary_, written in 1747, he describes his
task as one that 'may be successfully performed without any higher
quality than that of bearing burdens with dull patience, and beating the
track of the alphabet with sluggish resolution.' _Works_, v. 1. In 1751,
in the _Rambler_, No. 141, he thus pleasantly touches on his work: 'The
task of every other slave [except the 'wit'] has an end. The rower in
time reaches the port; the lexicographer at last finds the conclusion of
his alphabet.' On April 15, 1755, he writes to his friend Hector:--'I
wish, come of wishes what will, that my work may please you, as much as
it now and then pleased me, for I did not find dictionary making so very
unpleasant as it may be thought.' _Notes and Queries_, 6th S. 111, 301.
He told Dr. Blacklock that 'it was easier to him to write poetry than to
compose his _Dictionary_. His mind was less on the stretch in doing the
one than the other.' Boswell's _Hebrides_, Aug. 17, 1773.

[558] The well-known picture of the company at Tunbridge Wells in Aug.
1748, with the references in Richardson's own writing, is given as a
frontispiece to vol. iii. of Richardson's _Correspondence_. There can be
no doubt that the figure marked by Richardson as Dr. Johnson is not
Samuel Johnson, who did not receive a doctor's degree till more than
four years after Richardson's death.

[559] 'Johnson hardly ever spoke of Bathurst without tears in his eyes.'
Murphy's _Johnson_, p. 56. Mrs. Piozzi, after recording an anecdote that
he had related to her of his childhood, continues:--'"I cannot imagine,"
said he, "what makes me talk of myself to you so, for I really never
mentioned this foolish story to anybody except Dr. Taylor, not even to
my dear, dear Bathurst, whom I loved better than ever I loved any human
creature; but poor Bathurst is dead!" Here a long pause and a few tears
ensued.' Piozzi's _Anec_., p. 18. Another day he said to her:--'Dear
Bathurst was a man to my very heart's content: he hated a fool, and he
hated a rogue, and he hated a Whig; he was a very good hater.' _Ib_. p.
83. In his _Meditations on Easter-Day_, 1764, he records:--'After sermon
I recommended Tetty in a prayer by herself; and my father, mother,
brother, and Bathurst in another.' _Pr. and Med_., p. 54. See also
_post_, under March 18, 1752, and 1780 in Mr. Langton's _Collection_.

[560] Of Hawkesworth Johnson thus wrote: 'An account of Dr. Swift has
been already collected, with great diligence and acuteness, by Dr.
Hawkesworth, according to a scheme which I laid before him in the
intimacy of our friendship. I cannot therefore be expected to say much
of a life concerning which I had long since communicated my thoughts to
a man capable of dignifying his narrations with so much elegance of
language and force of sentiment.' Johnson's _Works_, viii. 192.
Hawkesworth was an imitator of Johnson's style; _post_, under Jan.
1, 1753.

[561] He was afterwards for several years Chairman of the Middlesex
justices, and upon occasion of presenting an address to the King,
accepted the usual offer of Knighthood. He is authour of 'A History of
Musick,' in five volumes in quarto. By assiduous attendance upon Johnson
in his last illness, he obtained the office of one of his executors; in
consequence of which, the booksellers of London employed him to publish
an edition of Dr. Johnson's works, and to write his Life. BOSWELL. This
description of Hawkins, as 'Mr. John Hawkins, an attorney,' is a reply
to his description of Boswell as 'Mr. James Boswell, a native of
Scotland.' Hawkins's _Johnson_, p. 472. According to Miss Hawkins,
'Boswell complained to her father of the manner in which he was
described. Where was the offence? It was one of those which a
complainant hardly dares to embody in words; he would only repeat,
"Well, but _Mr. James Boswell_, surely, surely, _Mr. James Boswell_"'
Miss Hawkins's _Memoirs_, i. 235. Boswell in thus styling Hawkins
remembered no doubt Johnson's sarcasm against attorneys. See _post_,
1770, in Dr. Maxwell's _Collectanea_. Hawkins's edition of _Johnson's
Works_ was published in 1787-9, in 13 vols., 8vo., the last two vols.
being edited by Stockdale. In vol. xi. is a collection of Johnson's
sayings, under the name of _Apothegms_, many of which I quote in
my notes.

[562] Boswell, it is clear, has taken his account of the club from
Hawkins, who writes:--'Johnson had, in the winter of 1749, formed a club
that met weekly at the King's Head, a famous beef-steak house in Ivy
Lane, near St. Paul's, every Tuesday evening. Thither he constantly
resorted with a disposition to please and be pleased. Our conversations
seldom began till after a supper so very solid and substantial as led us
to think that with him it was a dinner.

'By the help of this refection, and no other incentive to hilarity than
lemonade, Johnson was in a short time after our assembling transformed
into a new creature; his habitual melancholy and lassitude of spirit
gave way; his countenance brightened.' Hawkins's _Johnson_, pp. 219,
250. Other parts of Hawkins's account do not agree with passages in
Johnson's letters to Mrs. Thrale written in 1783-4. 'I dined about a
fortnight ago with three old friends [Hawkins, Ryland, and Payne]; we
had not met together for thirty years. In the thirty years two of our
set have died.' _Piozzi Letters_, ii. 339. 'We used to meet weekly about
the year fifty.' _Ib_. p. 361. 'The people whom I mentioned in my letter
are the remnant of a little club that used to meet in Ivy Lane about
three and thirty years ago, out of which we have lost Hawkesworth and
Dyer, the rest are yet on this side the grave.' _Ib_. p. 363. Hawkins
says the club broke up about 1756 (_Life_, p. 361). Johnson in the first
of the passages says they had not met at all for thirty years--that is
to say, not since 1753; while in the last two passages he implies that
their weekly meetings came to an end about 1751. I cannot understand
moreover how, if Bathurst, 'his beloved friend,' belonged to the club,
Johnson should have forgotten it. Bathurst died in the expedition to the
Havannah about 1762. Two others of those given in Hawkins's list were
certainly dead by 1783. M'Ghie, who died while the club existed (_Ib_.
p. 361), and Dr. Salter. A writer in the _Builder_ (Dec. 1884) says,
'The King's Head was burnt down twenty-five years ago, but the cellarage
remains beneath No. 4, Alldis's dining-rooms, on the eastern side.'

[563] Tom Tyers said that Johnson 'in one night composed, after
finishing an evening in Holborn, his _Hermit of Teneriffe_.' _Gent.
Mag_. for 1784, p. 901. The high value that he set on this piece may be
accounted for in his own words. 'Many causes may vitiate a writer's
judgment of his own works.... What has been produced without toilsome
efforts is considered with delight, as a proof of vigorous faculties and
fertile invention.' Johnson's _Works_, vii. 110. He had said much the
same thirty years earlier in _The Rambler_ (No. 21).

[564] 'On January 9 was published, long wished, another satire from
Juvenal, by the author of _London.' Gent. Mag_. xviii. 598, 9.

[565] Sir John Hawkins, with solemn inaccuracy, represents this poem as
a consequence of the indifferent reception of his tragedy. But the fact
is, that the poem was published on the 9th of January, and the tragedy
was not acted till the 6th of the February following. BOSWELL. Hawkins
perhaps implies what Boswell says that he represents; but if so, he
implies it by denying it. Hawkins's _Johnson_, p. 201.

[566] 'I wrote,' he said, 'the first seventy lines in _The Vanity of
Human Wishes_ in the course of one morning in that small house beyond
the church at Hampstead.' _Works_ (1787), xi. 212.

[567] See _post_ under Feb. 15, 1766. That Johnson did not think that in
hasty composition there is any great merit, is shewn by _The Rambler_,
No. 169, entitled _Labour necessary to excellence_. There he describes
'pride and indigence as the two great hasteners of modern poems.' He
continues:--'that no other method of attaining lasting praise [than
_multa dies et multa litura_] has been yet discovered may be conjectured
from the blotted manuscripts of Milton now remaining, and from the tardy
emission of Pope's compositions.' He made many corrections for the later
editions of his poem.

[568] 'Nov. 25, 1748. I received of Mr. Dodsley fifteen guineas, for
which assign to him the right of copy of an imitation of the _Tenth
Satire of Juvenal_, written by me; reserving to myself the right of
printing one edition. SAM. JOHNSON.'

'London, 29 June, 1786. A true copy, from the original in Dr. Johnson's
handwriting. JAS. DODSLEY. BOSWELL.

_London_ was sold at a shilling a copy. Johnson was paid at the rate of
about 9-1/2_d_. a line for this poem; for _The Vanity of Human Wishes_
at the rate of about 10_d_. a line. Dryden by his engagement with Jacob
Tonson (see Johnson's _Works_, vii. 298) undertook to furnish 10,000
verses at a little over 6_d_. a verse. Goldsmith was paid for _The
Traveller_ £21, or about 11-1/2_d_. a line.

[569] He never published it. See _post_ under Dec. 9, 1784.

[570] 'Jan. 9, 1821. Read Johnson's _Vanity of Human Wishes_,--all the
examples and mode of giving them sublime, as well as the latter part,
with the exception of an occasional couplet. I do not so much admire the
opening. The first line, 'Let observation,' etc., is certainly heavy and
useless. But 'tis a grand poem--and so _true_!--true as the Tenth of
Juvenal himself. The lapse of ages changes all things--time--language--
the earth--the bounds of the sea--the stars of the sky, and everything
"about, around, and underneath" man, _except man himself_. The infinite
variety of lives conduct but to death, and the infinity of wishes lead
but to disappointment.' _Byron_, vol. v. p. 66. WRIGHT. Sir Walter Scott
said 'that he had more pleasure in reading _London_, and _The Vanity of
Human Wishes _than any other poetical composition he could mention.'
Lockhart's _Scott_, iii. 269. Mr. Lockhart adds that 'the last line of
MS. that Scott sent to the press was a quotation from _The Vanity of
Human Wishes_.' Of the first lines

'Let observation with extensive view
Survey mankind from China to Peru,'

De Quincey quotes the criticism of some writer, who 'contends with some
reason that this is saying in effect:--"Let observation with extensive
observation observe mankind extensively."' De Quincey's _Works_, x. 72.

[571] From Mr. Langton. BOSWELL.

[572] In this poem one of the instances mentioned of unfortunate learned
men is _Lydiat_:

'Hear Lydiat's life, and Galileo's end.'

The history of Lydiat being little known, the following account of him
may be acceptable to many of my readers. It appeared as a note in the
Supplement to the _Gent. Mag_. for 1748, in which some passages
extracted from Johnson's poem were inserted, and it should have been
added in the subsequent editions.--A very learned divine and
mathematician, fellow of New College, Oxon, and Rector of Okerton, near
Banbury. He wrote, among many others, a Latin treatise _De Natura call_,
etc., in which he attacked the sentiments of Scaliger and Aristotle, not
bearing to hear it urged, _that some things are true in philosophy and
false in divinity_. He made above 600 Sermons on the harmony of the
Evangelists. Being unsuccessful in publishing his works, he lay in the
prison of Bocardo at Oxford, and in the King's Bench, till Bishop Usher,
Dr. Laud, Sir William Boswell, and Dr. Pink, released him by paying his
debts. He petitioned King Charles I. to be sent into Ethiopia, etc., to
procure MSS. Having spoken in favour of Monarchy and bishops, he was
plundered by the parliament forces, and twice carried away prisoner from
his rectory; and afterwards had not a shirt to shift him in three
months, without he borrowed it, and died very poor in 1646. BOSWELL.

[576] 'Of all authors,' wrote Johnson, 'those are the most wretched who
exhibit their productions on the theatre, and who are to propitiate
first the manager and then the public. Many an humble visitant have I
followed to the doors of these lords of the drama, seen him touch the
knocker with a shaking hand, and after long deliberation adventure to
solicit entrance by a single knock.' _Works_, v. 360.

[577] Mahomet was, in fact, played by Mr. Barry, and Demetrius by Mr.
Garrick: but probably at this time the parts were not yet cast. BOSWELL.

[578] The expression used by Dr. Adams was 'soothed.' I should rather
think the audience was _awed_ by the extraordinary spirit and dignity of
the following lines:

'Be this at least his praise, be this his pride,
To force applause no modern arts are tried:
Should partial catcalls all his hopes confound,
He bids no trumpet quell the fatal sound;
Should welcome sleep relieve the weary wit,
He rolls no thunders o'er the drowsy pit;
No snares to captivate the judgement spreads,
Nor bribes your eyes to prejudice your heads.
Unmov'd, though witlings sneer and rivals rail,
Studious to please, yet not asham'd to fail,
He scorns the meek address, the suppliant strain,
With merit needless, and without it vain;
In Reason, Nature, Truth, he dares to trust;
Ye fops be silent, and ye wits be just!'

BOSWELL.

[579] Johnson said of Mrs. Pritchard's playing in general that 'it was
quite mechanical;' _post_, April 7, 1775. See also _post_ under
Sept. 30, 1783.

[580] 'The strangling of Irene in the view of the audience was suggested
by Mr. Garrick.' Davies's _Garrick_, i. 128. Dryden in his _Essay of
Dramatick Poesie_ (edit. 1701, i. 13), says:--'I have observed that in
all our tragedies the audience cannot forbear laughing when the actors
are to die; 'tis the most comick part of the whole play.' 'Suppose your
Piece admitted, acted; one single ill-natured jest from the pit is
sufficient to cancel all your labours.' Goldsmith's _Present State of
Polite Learning_, chap. x.

[581] In her last speech two of the seven lines are very bad:--

'Guilt and despair, pale spectres! grin around me,
And stun me with the yellings of damnation!'

Act v. sc. 9.

[582] Murphy referring to Boswell's statement says:--'The Epilogue, we
are told in a late publication, was written by Sir William Young. This
is a new discovery, but by no means probable. When the appendages to a
Dramatic Performance are not assigned to a friend, or an unknown hand,
or a person of fashion, they are always supposed to be written by the
author of the Play.' Murphy's _Johnson_, p. 154. He overlooks altogether
the statement in the _Gent. Mag_. (xix. 85) that the Epilogue is 'by
another hand.' Mr. Croker points out that the words 'as Johnson informed
me' first appear in the second edition. The wonder is that Johnson
accepted this Epilogue, which is a little coarse and a little profane.
Yonge was Secretary at War in Walpole's ministry. Walpole said of him
'that nothing but Yonge's character could keep down his parts, and
nothing but his parts support his character.' Horace Walpole's
_Letters_, i. 98, note.

[583] I know not what Sir John Hawkins means by the _cold reception_ of
_Irene_. (See note, p. 192.) I was at the first representation, and most
of the subsequent. It was much applauded the first night, particularly
the speech on _to-morrow_ [Act iii. sc. 2]. It ran nine nights at least.
It did not indeed become a stock-play, but there was not the least
opposition during the representation, except the first night in the last
act, where Irene was to be strangled on the stage, which _John_ could
not bear, though a dramatick poet may stab or slay by hundreds. The
bow-string was not a Christian nor an ancient Greek or Roman death. But
this offence was removed after the first night, and Irene went off the
stage to be strangled.--BURNEY.

[584] According to the _Gent. Mag_. (xix. 76) 'it was acted from Monday,
Feb. 6, to Monday, Feb. 20, inclusive.' A letter in the _Garrick
Corres_, (i. 32), dated April 3, 1745, seems to shew that so long a run
was uncommon. The writer addressing Garrick says:--'You have now
performed it [_Tancred_] for nine nights; consider the part, and whether
nature can well support the frequent repetition of such shocks. Permit
me to advise you to resolve not to act upon any account above three
times a week.' Yet against this may be set the following passage in the
_Rambler_, No. l23:--'At last a malignant author, whose performance I
had persecuted through the nine nights, wrote an epigram upon Tape the
critic, which drove me from the pit for ever.' Murphy writing in 1792
said that _Irene_ had not been exhbited on any stage since its first
representation. Murphy's _Johnson_, p. 52.

[585] Mr. Croker says that 'it appears by a MS. note in Isaac Reed's
copy of Murphy's Life, that the receipts of the third, sixth, and ninth
nights, after deducting sixty guineas a night for the expenses of the
house, amounted to £195 17s.: Johnson cleared therefore, with the
copyright, very nearly £300.' _Irene_ was sold at the price of 1s. 6d. a
copy (_Gent. Mag_. xix. 96); so that Dodsley must have looked for a very
large sale.

[586] See _post_, 1780, in Mr. Langton's _Collection_ for Johnson's
estimate of _Irene_ in later life.

[587] Aaron Hill (vol. ii. p. 355), in a letter to Mr. Mallett, gives
the following account of _Irene_ after having seen it: 'I was at the
anomalous Mr. Johnson's benefit, and found the play his proper
representative; strong sense ungraced by sweetness or decorum.' BOSWELL.

[588] See _ante_, p. 102

[589] Murphy (_Life_, p. 53) says that some years afterwards, when he
knew Johnson to be in distress, he asked Garrick why he did not produce
another tragedy for his Lichfield friend? Garrick's answer was
remarkable: "When Johnson writes tragedy, declamation roars, and passion
sleeps: when Shakespeare wrote; he dipped his pen in his own heart."
Johnson was perhaps aware of the causes of his failure as a
tragedy-writer. In his criticism of Addison's _Cato_ he says: 'Of _Cato_
it has been not unjustly determined that it is rather a poem in dialogue
than a drama, rather a succession of just sentiments in elegant language
than a representation of natural affections, or any state probable or
possible in human life ... The events are expected without solicitude,
and are remembered without joy or sorrow.... Its success has introduced
or confirmed among us the use of dialogue too declamatory, of
unaffecting elegance and chill philosophy.' _Works_, vii. 456. 'Johnson
thought: _Cato_ the best model of tragedy we had; yet he used to say, of
all things the most ridiculous would be to see a girl cry at the
representation of it.' Johnson's _Works_ (1787), xi. 207. _Cato_, if
neglected, has added at least eight 'habitual quotations' to the
language (see Thackeray's _English Humourists_, p. 98). _Irene_ has
perhaps not added a single one. It has neverthingless some quotable
lines, such as--

'Crowds that hide a monarch from
  himself.' Act i. sc. 4.
'To cant ... of reason to a lover.'
  Act iii. sc. 1.
'When e'en as love was breaking
  off from wonder,
And tender accents quiver'd on my
  lips.' Ib.
'And fate lies crowded in a narrow
  space.' Act iii. sc. 6.
'Reflect that life and death, affecting
  sounds,
Are only varied modes of endless
  being.' Act ii. sc. 8.
'Directs the planets with a careless
  nod.' Ib.
'Far as futurity's untravell'd waste.'
  Act iv. sc. 1.
'And wake from ignorance the
  western world.' Act iv. sc. 2.
'Through hissing ages a proverbial
  coward,
The tale of women, and the scorn
  of fools.' Act iv. sc. 3.
'No records but the records of the
  sky.' Ib.
'... thou art sunk beneath reproach.'
  Act v. sc. 2.
'Oh hide me from myself.'
  Act v. sc. 3.

[590] Johnson wrote of Milton:--'I cannot but conceive him calm and
confident, little disappointed, not at all dejected, relying on his own
merit with steady consciousness, and waiting without impatience the
vicissitudes of opinion, and the impartiality of a future generation.'
Johnson's _Works_, vii. 108.

[591]

'Genus irritabile vatum.'
'The fretful tribe of rival poets.'

Francis, _Horace_, Ep. ii. 2. 102.

[592] This deference he enforces in many passages in his writings; as
for instance:--'Dryden might have observed, that what is good only
because it pleases, cannot be pronounced good till it has been found to
please.' Johnson's _Works_, vii. 252. 'The authority of Addison is
great; yet the voice of the people, when to please the people is the
purpose, deserves regard.' _Ib_. 376. 'About things on which the public
thinks long, it commonly attains to think right.' _Ib_. 456. 'These
apologies are always useless: "de gustibus non est disputandum;" men may
be convinced, but they cannot be pleased against their will.' _Ib_.
viii. 26. 'Of things that terminate in human life, the world is the
proper judge; to despise its sentence, if it were possible, is not just;
and if it were just, is not possible.' _Ib_. viii. 316. Lord
Chesterfield in writing to his son about his first appearance in the
world said, 'You will be tried and judged there, not as a boy, but as a
man; and from that moment _there is no appeal for character_.' Lord
Chesterfield's _Letters_, iii. 324. Addison in the _Guardian_, No. 98,
had said that 'men of the best sense are always diffident of their
private judgment, till it receives a sanction from the public. _Provoco
ad populum_, I appeal to the people, was the usual saying of a very
excellent dramatic poet, when he had any disputes with particular
persons about the justness and regularity of his productions.' See
_post_, March 23, 1783.

[593] 'Were I,' he said, 'to wear a laced or embroidered waistcoat, it
should be very rich. I had once a very rich laced waistcoat, which I
wore the first night of my tragedy.' Boswell's _Hebrides_, Oct.
27, 1773.

[594] 'Topham Beauclerc used to give a pleasant description of this
greenroom finery, as related by the author himself: 'But,' said Johnson,
with great gravity, 'I soon laid aside my gold-laced hat, lest it should
make me proud.' Murphy's _Johnson_, p. 52. In _The Idler_ (No. 62) we
have an account of a man who had longed to 'issue forth in all the
splendour of embroidery.' When his fine clothes were brought, 'I felt
myself obstructed,' he wrote, 'in the common intercourse of civility by
an uneasy consciousness of my new appearance; as I thought myself more
observed, I was more anxious about my mien and behaviour; and the mien
which if formed by care is commonly ridiculous.'

_The Spectator_ on Dec 6, 1712; and the second series of _The Spectator_
on December 20, 1714.

[598] 'Two new designs have appeared about the middle of this month
[March, 1750], one entitled, _The Tatler Revived; or The Christian
Philosopher and Politician_, half a sheet, price 2_d_. (stamped); the

[601] I have heard Dr. Warton mention, that he was at Mr. Robert
Dodsley's with the late Mr. Moore, and several of his friends,
considering what should be the name of the periodical paper which Moore
had undertaken. Garrick proposed _The Sallad_, which, by a curious
coincidence, was afterwards applied to himself by Goldsmith:

'Our Garrick's a sallad, for in him we see
Oil, vinegar, sugar, and saltness agree!'

[_Retaliation_, line II.]

At last, the company having separated, without any thing of which they
approved having been offered, Dodsley himself thought of _The
World_. BOSWELL.

salvation _both_ of myself and others.'

[606] 'Gray had a notion not very peculiar, that he could not write but
at certain times, or at happy moments; a fantastic foppery, to which my
kindness for a man of learning and virtue wishes him to have been
superior.' Johnson's _Works_, viii. 482. See _post_, under April
15, 1758.

[607] Her correspondence with Richardson and Mrs. Carter was published
in 1807.

[608] The correspondence between her and Mrs. Carter was published in
1808.

[609] Dr. Birch says:--'The proprietor of the _Rambler_, Cave, told me
that copy was seldom sent to the press till late in the night before the
day of publication,' Croker's _Boswell_, p. 121, note. See _post_, April
12, 1776, and beginning of 1781.

Johnson carefully revised the _Ramblers_ for the collected edition. The
editor of the Oxford edition of Johnson's _Works_ states (ii. x), that
'the alterations exceeded six thousand.' The following passage from the
last number affords a good instance of this revision.

_First edition_.

'I have never complied with temporary curiosity, nor furnished my
readers with abilities to discuss the topic of the day; I have seldom
exemplified my assertions by living characters; from my papers therefore
no man could hope either censures of his enemies or praises of himself,
and they only could be expected to peruse them, whose passions left them
leisure for the contemplation of abstracted truth, and whom virtue could
please by her native dignity without the assistance of modish
ornaments.' _Gent. Mag_. xxii. 117.

_Revised edition_.

'I have never complied with temporary curiosity, nor enabled my readers
to discuss the topic of the day; I have rarely exemplified my assertions
by living characters; in my papers no man could look for censures of his
enemies, or praises of himself; and they only were expected to peruse
them, whose passions left them leisure for abstracted truth, and whom
virtue could please by its naked dignity.' Johnson's _Works_, iii. 462.

[610] 'Such relicks [Milton's early manuscripts] shew how excellence is
acquired; what we hope ever to do with ease, we must learn first to do
with diligence.' Johnson's _Works_, vii. 119.

[611] Of the first 52 _Ramblers_ 49 were wholly by Johnson; of the last
156, 154. He seems to say that in the first 49, 17 were written from
notes, and in the last 154 only 13.

prospect has not been used in any of Johnson's essays. BOSWELL.

[616] From Horace (_Ars Poet_. 1. 175) he takes his motto for the
number:--

'Multa ferunt anni venientes commoda secum,
Multa recedentes adimunt.'
The blessings flowing in with life's full tide
Down with our ebb of life decreasing glide.'

the first word. See _post_, April 15, 1778, where Johnson says:

1779, where he says: 'Garrick had friends but no friend.'

[622] Sir John Hawkins has selected from this little collection of
materials, what he calls the 'Rudiments of two of the papers of the
_Rambler_.' But he has not been able to read the manuscript distinctly.
Thus he writes, p. 266, 'Sailor's fate any mansion;' whereas the
original is 'Sailor's life my aversion.' He has also transcribed the
unappropriated hints on _Writers for bread_, in which he decyphers these
notable passages, one in Latin, _fatui non famæ_, instead of _fami non
famæ_; Johnson having in his mind what Thuanus says of the learned
German antiquary and linguist, Xylander, who, he tells us, lived in such
poverty, that he was supposed _fami non famæ scribere_; and another in
French, _Degente de fate [fatu] et affamé a'argent_, instead of _Dégouté
de fame_, (an old word for _renommée_) _et affamé d'argent_. The
manuscript being written in an exceedingly small hand, is indeed very
hard to read; but it would have been better to have left blanks than to
write nonsensc. BOSWELL.

[623] When we know that of the 208 _Ramblers_ all but five were written
by Johnson, it is amusing to read a passage in one of Miss Talbot's
letters to Mrs. Carter, dated Oct. 20, 1750:--'Mr. Johnson would, I
fear, be mortified to hear that people know a paper of his own by the
sure mark of somewhat a little excessive, a little exaggerated in the
expression.' _Carter Corres_. i. 357.

[624] The _Ramblers_ certainly were little noticed at first. Smart, the
poet, first mentioned them to me as excellent papers, before I had heard
any one else speak of them. When I went into Norfolk, in the autumn of
1751, I found but one person, (the Rev. Mr. Squires, a man of learning,
and a general purchaser of new books,) who knew anything of them. Before
I left Norfolk in the year 1760, the _Ramblers_ were in high favour
among persons of learning and good taste. Others there were, devoid of
both, who said that the _hard words_ in the _Rambler_ were used by the
authour to render his _Dictionary_ indispensably necessary. BURNEY. We
have notices of the _Rambler_ in the _Carter Corres_:--'May 28, 1750.
The author ought to be cautioned not to use over many hard words. In
yesterday's paper (a very pretty one indeed) we had _equiponderant, and
another so hard I cannot remember it [adscititious], both in one
sentence.' 'Dec. 17, 1750:--Mr. Cave complains of him for not admitting
correspondents; this does mischief. In the main I think he is to be
applauded for it. But why then does he not write now and then on the
living manners of the times?' In writing on April 22, 1752, just after
the _Rambler_ had come to an end, Miss Talbot says:--'Indeed 'tis a sad
thing that such a paper should have met with discouragement from wise
and learned and good people too. Many are the disputes it has cost me,
and not once did I come off triumphant.' Mrs. Carter replied:--'Many a
battle have I too fought for him in the country, out with little
success.' Murphy says:--'of this excellent production the number sold on
each day did not amount to five hundred; of course the bookseller, who
paid the author four guineas a week, did not carry on a successful
trade.' Murphy's _Johnson_, p. 59.

[625] Richardson wrote to Cave on Aug. 9, 1750, after forty-one numbers
had appeared:--'I hope the world tastes them; for its own sake I hope
the world tastes them. The author I can only guess at. There is but one
man, I think, that could write them.' _Rich. Corres_, i. 165. Cave
replied:--'Mr. Johnson is the _Great Rambler_, being, as you observe,
the only man who can furnish two such papers in a week, besides his
other great business.' He mentioned the recommendation it received from
high quarters, and continued:--'Notwithstanding, whether the price of
two-pence, or the unfavourable season of their first publication hinders
the demand, no boast can be made of it.' Johnson had not wished his name
to be known. Cave says that 'Mr. Carrick and others, who knew the
author's powers and style from the first, unadvisedly asserting their
suspicions, overturned the scheme of secrecy.' _Ib_. pp. 168-170.

[626] Horace Walpole, while justifying George II. against 'bookish men
who have censured his neglect of literature,' says:--'In truth, I
believe King George would have preferred a guinea to a composition as
perfect as _Alexander's Feast.' Reign of George II_, iii. 304.

[627] 'Dr. Johnson said to an acquaintance of mine, "My other works are
wine and water; but my _Rambler_ is pure wine."' Rogers's _Table
Talk_, p. 10.

[629] It was executed in the printing-office of Sands, Murray, and
Cochran, with uncommon elegance, upon writing-paper, of a duodecimo
size, and with the greatest correctness; and Mr. Elphinston enriched it
with translations of the mottos. When completed, it made eight handsome
volumes. It is, unquestionably, the most accurate and beautiful edition
of this work; and there being but a small impression, it is now become
scarce, and sells at a very high price. BOSWELL.

[630] Mr. Thomas Ruddiman, the learned grammarian of Scotland, well
known for his various excellent works, and for his accurate editions of
several authours. He was also a man of a most worthy private character.
His zeal for the Royal House of Stuart did not render him less estimable
in Dr. Johnson's eye. BOSWELL.

[631] In the _Gent. Mag_. for Sept. 1750, and for Oct. 1752,
translations of many of the mottoes were given; but in each number there
are several of Elphinston's. Johnson seems to speak of only one.

[632] Writing to Miss Porter on July 12, 1749, he said:--'I was afraid
your letter had brought me ill news of my mother, whose death is one of
the few calamities on which I think with terror.' Crokers _Boswell_,
p. 62.

[633] Mr. Strahan was Elphinston's brother-in-law. _Post_, April 9,
1778.

[634] In the _Gent. Mag_. for January, 1752, in the list of books
published is:--'A correct and beautiful edition of the Rambler in 4
volumes, in 12mo. Price 12s.' The _Rambler_ was not concluded till the
following March. The remaining two volumes were published in July.
_Gent. Mag_. xxii. 338.

[635] According to Hawkins (_Life_, P. 269) each edition consisted of
1250 copies.

[636] No. 55 [59.]. BOSWELL.

[637] Miss Burney records in her Diary that one day at Streatham, while
she and Mrs. Thrale 'were reading this Rambler, Dr. Johnson came in. We
told him what we were about. "Ah, madam!" cried he, "Goldsmith was not
scrupulous; but he would have been a great man had he known the real
value of his own internal resources."' Mme. D'Arblay's _Diary_, i. 83.
See _post_, beginning of 1768.

[638] It is possible that Mrs. Hardcastle's drive in _She Stoops to
Conquer_ was suggested by the _Rambler_, No. 34. In it a young gentleman
describes a lady's terror on a coach journey. 'Our whole conversation
passed in dangers, and cares, and fears, and consolations, and stories
of ladies dragged in the mire, forced to spend all the night on a heath,
drowned in rivers, or burnt with lightning.... We had now a new scene of
terror, every man we saw was a robber, and we were ordered sometimes to
drive hard, lest a traveller whom we saw behind should overtake us; and
sometimes to stop, lest we should come up to him who was passing before
us. She alarmed many an honest man by begging him to spare her life as
he passed by the coach.'

[639] Dr. Johnson was gratified by seeing this selection, and wrote to
Mr. Kearsley, bookseller in Fleet-Street, the following note:--

'Mr. Johnson sends compliments to Mr. Kearsley, and begs the favour of
seeing him as soon as he can. Mr. Kearsley is desired to bring with him
the last edition of what he has honoured with the name of BEAUTIES. May
20, 1782.' BOSWELL. The correspondence, _post_, May 15, 1782, shews that
Johnson sent for this book, not because he was gratified, but because he
was accused, on the strength of one of the _Beauties_, of recommending
suicide. On that day, being in the country, he wrote: 'I never saw the
book but by casual inspection, and considered myself as utterly
disengaged from its consequences.' He adds:--'I hope some time in the
next week to have all rectified.' The letter of May 20 shews that on his
return to town he lost little time, if any, in sending for Kearsley.

[640] See _post_, April 12, 1781.

[641] Ecclesiastes vii. 4.

[642] In the original '_separated sooner_ than subdued.' Johnson acted
up to what he said. When he was close on his end, 'all who saw him
beheld and acknowledged the _invictum animum Catonis_ ... Talking of his
illness he said:--"I will be conquered; I will not capitulate."' See
_post_, Oct. 1784.

[643] In the _Spectator_, No. 568, Addison tells of a village in which
'there arose a current report that somebody had written a book against
the 'squire and the whole parish.' The book was _The Whole Duty of Man_.

[644] 'The character of Prospero was, beyond all question, occasioned by
Garrick's ostentatious display of furniture and Dresden china.' Murphy's
_Johnson_, p. 144. If Garrick was aimed at, it is surprising that the
severity of the satire did not bring to an end, not only all friendship,
but even any acquaintance between the two men. The writer describes how
he and Prospero had set out in the world together, and how for a long
time they had assisted each other, till his friend had been lately
raised to wealth by a lucky project. 'I felt at his sudden shoot of
success an honest and disinterested joy.' Prospero reproached him with
his neglect to visit him at his new house. When however he went to see
him, he found that his friend's impatience 'arose not from any desire to
communicate his happiness, but to enjoy his superiority.' He was kept
waiting at the door, and when at length he was shewn up stairs, he found
the staircase carefully secured by mats from the pollution of his feet.
Prospero led him into a backroom, where he told him he always
breakfasted when he had not great company. After the visitor had endured
one act of insolence after another, he says:--'I left him without any
intention of seeing him again, unless some misfortune should restore his
understanding.' _Rambler_, No. 200. See _post_, May 15, 1776, where
Johnson, speaking of the charge of meanness brought against Garrick,
said, 'he might have been much better attacked for living with more
splendour than is suitable to a player.'

[645] In C. C. Greville's _Journal_ (ii. 316) we have an instance how
stories about Johnson grew. He writes:--'Lord Holland told some stories
of Johnson and Garrick which he had heard from Kemble.... When Garrick
was in the zenith of his popularity, and grown rich, and lived with the
great, and while Johnson was yet obscure, the Doctor used to drink tea
with him, and he would say, "Davy, I do not envy you your money nor your
fine acquaintance, but I envy you your power of drinking such tea as
this." "Yes," said Garrick, "it is very good tea, but it is not my best,
nor that which I give to my Lord this and Sir somebody t'other."' There
can be little doubt that the whole story is founded on the following
passage in the character of Prospero: 'Breakfast was at last set, and,
as I was not willing to indulge the peevishness that began to seize me,
I commended the tea. Prospero then told me that another time I should
taste his finest sort, but that he had only a very small quantity
remaining, and reserved it for those whom he thought himself obliged to
treat with particular respect.' See _post_, April 10, 1778, where
Johnson maintained that Garrick bore his good-fortune with modesty.

[646] No 98.

[647] Yet his style did not escape the harmless shafts of pleasant
humour; for the ingenious Bonnell Thornton published a mock Rambler in
the _Drury-lane Journal_. BOSWELL. Murphy (_Life_, p. 157), criticising
the above quotation from Johnson, says:--'He forgot the observation of
Dryden: "If too many foreign words are poured in upon us, it looks as if
they were designed, not to assist the natives, but to conquer them."'

[648] _Idler_, No. 70. BOSWELL. In the same number Johnson writes:--'Few
faults of style, whether real or imaginary, excite the malignity of a
more numerous class of readers than the use of hard words.... But words
are hard only to those who do not understand them; and the critic ought
always to inquire, whether he is incommoded by the fault of the writer
or by his own. Every author does not write for every reader.' See
_post_, Sept. 19, 1777, where Johnson says:--'If Robertson's style be
faulty he owes it to me; that is, having too many words, and those too
big ones.'

[649] The following passages in Temple's writings shew that a likeness
may be discovered between his style and Johnson's:--'There may be
firmness and constancy of courage from tradition as well as of belief:
nor, methinks, should any man know how to be a coward, that is brought
up with the opinion, that all of his nation or city have ever been
valiant.' Temple's _Works_, i. 167. 'This is a disease too refined for
this country and people, who are well, when they are not ill, and
pleased, when they are not troubled; are content, because they think
little of it; and seek their happiness in the common eases and
commodities of life, or the increase of riches; not amusing themselves
with the more speculative contrivances of passion, or refinements of
pleasure.' _Ib_. p. 170. 'They send abroad the best of their own butter
into all parts, and buy the cheapest out of Ireland, or the north of
England, for their own usc. In short they furnish infinite luxury which
they never practise, and traffic in pleasures which they never taste.'
_Ib_. p. 195. See _post_, April 9, 1778, where Johnson says:--'Temple
was the first writer who gave cadence to English prosc.'

[650] Dean Stanley calls Ephraim Chambers 'the Father of Cyclopedias.'
_Memorials of Westminster Abbey_, p. 299, note. The epitaph which
Chambers wrote for himself the Dean gives as:--'Multis pervulgatus,
paucis notus, qui vitam inter lucem et umbram, nec eruditus nec
idioticis literis deditus, transegit.' In the _Gent. Mag_. for 1740, p.
262, the last line is given, no doubt correctly, as:--'Nec eruditus nec
idiota, literis deditus.' The second edition of Chambers's _Cyclopaedia_
was published in 1738. There is no copy of his Proposal in the British
Museum or Bodleian. The resemblance between his style and Johnson's is
not great. The following passage is the most Johnsonian that I could
find:--'None of my predecessors can blame me for the use I have made of
them; since it is their own avowed practice. It is a kind of privilege
attached to the office of lexicographer; if not by any formal grant, yet
by connivance at least. I have already assumed the bee for my device,
and who ever brought an action of trover or trespass against that avowed
free-booter? 'Tis vain to pretend anything of property in things of this
nature. To offer our thoughts to the public, and yet pretend a right
reserved therein to oneself, if it be not absurd, yet it is sordid. The
words we speak, nay the breath we emit, is not more vague and common
than our thoughts, when divulged in print.' Chambers's Preface,
p. xxiii.

[651] 'There were giants in the earth in those days.' _Gen_. vi. 4.

[652] A GREAT PERSONAGE first appears in the second edition. In the
first edition we merely find 'by one whose authority,' &c. Boswell in
his _Hebrides_, Aug. 28, 1773, speaks of George III. as 'a Great
Personage.' In his _Letter to the People of Scotland_ (p. 90) he thus
introduces an anecdote about the King--and Paoli:--'I have one other
circumstance to communicate; but it is of the highest value. I
communicate it with a mixture of awe and fondness.--That Great
Personage, who is allowed by all to have the best _memory_ of any man
_born a Briton_, &c. In the _Probationary Odes for the Laureateship_,
published a few months after Boswell's _Letter_, a 'Great Personage' is
ludicrously introduced; pp. xxx. 63.

[653] The first nine lines form the motto.

[654] Horat. _Epist_. Lib. ii. Epist. ii. {1, 110} BOSWELL.

But how severely with themselves proceed
The men, who write such verse as we can read!
Their own strict judges, not a word they spare
That wants or force, or light, or weight, or care,
Howe'er unwillingly it quits its place,
Nay, though at court, perhaps, it may find grace:
Such they'll degrade; and some-times, in its stead,
In downright charity revive the dead;
Mark where a bold expressive phrase appears,
Bright through the rubbish of some hundred years;
Command old words that long have slept to wake,
Words that wise Bacon or brave Rawleigh spake;
Or bid the new be English, ages hence,
(For use will father what's begot by sense;)
Pour the full tide of eloquence along,
Serenely pure, and yet divinely strong,
Rich with the treasures of each foreign tongue.'

Pope, _Imitations of Horace_, ii. 2. 157

[655] 'Horat. _De Arte Poetica_. [1. 48.] BOSWELL.

[656] See Boswell's _Hebrides_, Aug. 29, 1773, where Boswell says that
up that date he had twice heard Johnson coin words, _peregrinity_ and
_depeditation_.

[657] 'The words which our authors have introduced by their knowledge of
foreign languages, or ignorance of their own, by vanity or wantonness,
by compliance with fashion or lust of innovation, I have registered as
they occurred, though commonly only to censure them, and warn others
against the folly of naturalizing useless foreigners to the injury of
the natives.... Our language for almost a century has, by the
concurrence of many causes, been gradually departing from its original
Teutonick character, and deviating towards a Gallick structure and
phraseology, from which it ought to be our endeavour to recall it, by
making our ancient volumes the groundwork of style.... From the authors
which rose in the time of Elizabeth a speech might be formed adequate to
all the purposes of use and elegance.' Johnson's _Works_, v. pp. 31, 39.
See _post_. May 12, 1778.

[658] If Johnson sometimes indulged his _Brownism_ (see _post_,
beginning of 1756), yet he saw much to censure in Browne's style. 'His
style is, indeed, a tissue of many languages; a mixture of heterogeneous
words, brought together from distant regions, with terms originally
appropriated to one art, and drawn by violence into the service of
another. He must however be confessed to have augmented our
philosophical diction.... His innovations are sometimes pleasing, and
his temerities happy.' Johnson's _Works_, vi. 500. 'It is remarkable
that the pomp of diction, which has been objected to Johnson, was first
assumed in the _Rambler_. His _Dictionary_ was going on at the same
time, and in the course of that work, as he grew familiar with technical
and scholastic words, he thought that the bulk of his readers were
equally learned; or at least would admire the splendour and dignity of
the style.' Murphy's _Johnson_, p. 156.

'The observation of his having imitated Sir Thomas Brown has been made
by many people; and lately it has been insisted on, and illustrated by a
variety of quotations from Brown, in one of the popular Essays written
by the Reverend Mr. Knox [the Essay is No. xxii. of _Winter Evenings_,
Knox's _Works_, ii 397], master of Tumbridge school, whom I have set
down in my list [_post_, under Dec. 6, 1784] of those who have sometimes
not unsuccessfully imitated Dr. Johnson's style. BOSWELL.

[659] The following observation in Mr. Boswell's _Journal of a Tour to
the Hebrides_ [p. 9] may sufficiently account for that Gentleman's being
'now scarcely esteem'd a Scot' by many of his countrymen:--If he [Dr.
Johnson] was particularly prejudiced against the Scots, it was because
they were more in his way; because he thought their success in England
rather exceeded the due proportion of their real merit; and because he
could not but see in them that nationality which, I believe, no
liberal-minded Scotchman will deny.' Mr. Boswell, indeed, is so free
from national prejudices, that he might with equal propriety have been
described as--

'Scarce by _South_ Britons now
   esteem'd a Scot.'
       COURTENAY. BOSWELL.

[660] Malone says that 'Baretti used sometimes to walk with Johnson
through the streets at night, and occasionally entered into conversation
with the unfortunate women who frequent them, for the sake of hearing
their stories. It was from a history of one of these, which a girl told
under a tree in the King's Bench Walk in the Temple to Baretti and
Johnson, that he formed the story of Misella in the _Rambler_ [Nos. 170
and 171].' Prior's _Malone_, p. 161. 'Of one [of these women] who was
very handsome he asked, for what she thought God had given her so much
beauty. She answered:--"To please gentlemen."' Hawkins's _Johnson_, p.
321. See also _post_, under Dec. 2, 1784.

[661] Hawkins (_Life_, p. 270) had said that 'the characteristics of
Addison's style are feebleness and inanity.' He was thus happily
ridiculed by Person:--'Soon after the publication of Sir John's book, a
parcel of Eton boys, not having the fear of God before their eyes, etc.,
instead of playing truant, robbing orchards, annoying poultry, or
performing any other part of their school exercise, fell foul in print
(see the _Microcosm_, No. 36) upon his Worship's censure of Addison's
_middling_ style.... But what can you expect, as Lord Kames justly
observes, from a school where boys are taught to rob on the highway?'
Person, _Tracts_, p. 339.

[662] _Works_, vii. 473.

[663] When Johnson shewed me a proof-sheet of the character of Addison,
in which he so highly extols his style, I could not help observing, that
it had not been his own model, as no two styles could differ more from
each other.--'Sir, Addison had his style, and I have mine.'--When I
ventured to ask him, whether the difference did not consist in this,
that Addison's style was full of idioms, colloquial phrases, and
proverbs; and his own more strictly grammatical, and free from such
phraseology and modes of speech as can never be literally translated or
understood by foreigners; he allowed the discrimination to be just.--Let
any one who doubts it, try to translate one of Addison's _Spectators_
into Latin, French, or Italian; and though so easy, familiar, and
elegant, to an Englishman, as to give the intellect no trouble; yet he
would find the transfusion into another language extremely difficult, if
not impossible. But a _Rambler_, _Adventurer_, or _Idler_, of Johnson,
would fall into any classical or European language, as easily as if it
had been originally conceived in it. BURNEY. Mrs. Piozzi (_Anec_. p.
125) recounts how Johnson recommended Addison's works as a model for
imitation to Mr. Woodhouse, a poetical shoemaker. '"Give nights and
days, Sir, (said he) to the study of Addison, if you mean either to be a
good writer, or, what is more worth, an honest man." When I saw
something like the same expression in his criticism on that author, I
put him in mind of his past injunctions to the young poet, to which he
replied, "That he wished the shoemaker might have remembered them as
well."' Yet he says in his _Life of Pope ( Works_, viii. 284), 'He that
has once studiously formed a style rarely writes afterwards with
complete easc.'

[664] I shall probably, in another work, maintain the merit of Addison's
poetry, which has been very unjustly depreciated. BOSWELL. He proposed
also to publish an edition of Johnson's poems (_ante_, p. 16), an
account of his own travels (_post_, April 17, 1778), a collection, with
notes, of old tenures and charters of Scotland (_post_, Oct. 27, 1779),
and a History of James IV. of Scotland, 'the patron,' as he said, 'of my
family' (Boswell's _Hebrides_, Aug. 23, 1773).

[665] Lewis thus happily translates the lines in _Martial_,--

'Diligat ilia senèm quondam: sed et ipsa marito,
Tunc quoque cum fuerit, non videatur, anus.
'Wrinkled with age, may mutual love and truth
To their dim eyes recall the bloom of youth.'

_Rambler_, No. 167.

Some of Johnson's own translations are happy, as:--

'Quam juvat immites ventos audire cubantem
Aut, gelidas hibernus aquas quum fuderit auster,
Securum somnos, imbre juvante, sequi!
'How sweet in sleep to pass the careless hours,
Lull'd by the beating winds and dashing show'rs.'

_Ib_. No. 117.


[666] [Greek: Augon ek makaron antaxios eiae amoibae.]

'Celestial powers! that piety regard,
From you my labours wait their last reward.'

A modification of the Greek line is engraved on the scroll in Johnson's
monument in St. Paul's (_post_, Dec. 1784).

[667] 'The essays professedly serious, if I have been able to execute my
own intentions, will be found exactly conformable to the precepts of
Christianity.... I therefore look back on this part of my work with
pleasure, which no blame or praise of man shall diminish or augment.'
_Rambler_, No. 208.

[668] I have little doubt that this attack on the concluding verse is an
indirect blow at Hawkins, who had quoted the whole passage, and had
clearly thought it the more 'awful' on account of the couplet. See
Hawkins's _Johnson_, p. 291.

[669] In the original _Raleigh's_.

[670] The italics are Boswell's.

[671] Mrs. Williams is probably the person meant. BOSWELL.

[672] 'In 1750, April 5, _Comus_ was played for her benefit. She had so
little acquaintance with diversion or gaiety, that she did not know what
was intended when a benefit was theatre was offered her. The profits of
the night were only £130, though Dr. Newton brought a large
contribution; and £20 were given by Tonson, a man who is to be praised
as often as he is named.... This was the greatest benefaction that
_Paradise Lost_ ever procured the author's descendants; and to this he
who has now attempted to relate his life had the honour of contributing
a Prologue.' Johnson's _Works, vii. 118_. In the _Gent. Mag_. (xx. 152)
we read that, as on 'April 4, the night first appointed, many in
convenient circumstances happened to disappoint the hopes of success,
the managers generously quitted the profits of another night, in which
the theatre was expected to be fuller. Mr. Samuel Johnson's prologue was
afterwards printed for Mrs. Foster's benefit.'

[673] Johnson is thinking of Pope's lines--

'But still the great have kindness in reserve,
He helped to bury whom he helped to starve.'

Prologue to the _Satires_, 1. 247. In the _Life of Milton_ he
writes:--'In our time a monument has been erected in Westminster Abbey
_To the author of Paradise Lost_ by Mr. Benson, who has in the
inscription bestowed more words upon himself than upon Milton.'
Johnson's _Works_, vii. 112. Pope has a hit at Benson in the _Dunciad_,
iii. 325:--

'On poets' tombs see Benson's titles writ!'

Moore, describing Sheridan's funeral, says:--'It was well remarked by a
French Journal, in contrasting the penury of Sheridan's latter years
with the splendour of his funeral, that "France is the place for a man
of letters to live in, and England the place for him to die in."' Moore
himself wrote:--

'How proud they can press to the funeral array
Of him whom they shunned in his sickness and sorrow--
How bailiffs may seize his last blanket to-day,
Whose pall shall be held up by Nobles to-morrow.'

Moore's _Sheridan_, ii. 460-2.

[674] Johnson's _Works_, i. 115.

[675] Among the advertisements in the _Gent. Mag_. for February of this
year is the following:--'_An elegy wrote in a country churchyard, 6d_.'

[676] See Boswell's _Hebrides_, Aug. 17, 1773.

[677] 'Lest there should be any person, at any future period, absurd
enough to suspect that Johnson was a partaker in Lauder's fraud, or had
any knowledge of it, when he assisted him with his masterly pen, it is
proper here to quote the words of Dr. Douglas, now Bishop of Salisbury,
at the time when he detected the imposition. 'It is to be hoped, nay it
is _expected_, that the elegant and nervous writer, whose judicious
sentiments and inimitable style point out the authour of Lauder's
Preface and Postscript, will no longer allow one to _plume himself with
his feathers_, who appeareth so little to deserve [his] assistance: an
assistance which I am persuaded would never have been communicated, had
there been the least suspicion of those facts which I have been the
instrument of conveying to the world in these sheets.' _Milton no
Plagiary_, 2nd edit. p. 78. And his Lordship has been pleased now to
authorise me to say, in the strongest manner, that there is no ground
whatever for any unfavourable reflection against Dr. Johnson, who
expressed the strongest indignation against Lauder. BOSWELL. To this
letter Lauder had the impudence to add a shameless postscript and some
'testimonies' concerning himself. Though on the face of it it is evident
that this postscript is not by Johnson, yet it is included in his works
(v. 283). The letter was dated Dec. 20, 1750. In the _Gent. Mag_. for
the next month (xxi. 47) there is the following paragraph:--'Mr. Lauder
confesses here and exhibits all his forgeries; for which he assigns one
motive in the book, and after asking pardon assigns another in the
postscript; he also takes an opportunity to publish several letters and
testimonials to his former character.' Goldsmith in Retaliation has a
hit at Lauder:--

'Here Douglas retires from his toils to relax,
The scourge of impostors, the terror of quacks.
New Lauders and Bowers the Tweed shall cross over,
No countryman living their tricks to discover.'

Dr. Douglas was afterwards Bishop of Salisbury (_ante_, p. 127). See
_post_, June 25, 1763, for the part he took in exposing the Cock Lane
Ghost imposture.

[678] Scott writing to Southey in 1810 said:--'A witty rogue the other
day, who sent me a letter signed Detector, proved me guilty of stealing
a passage from one of Vida's Latin poems, which I had never seen or
heard of.' The passage alleged to be stolen ends with,--

'When pain and anguish wring the brow,
A ministering angel thou!'

which in Vida _ad Eranen. El_. ii. v. 21, ran,--

'Cum dolor atque supercilio gravis imminet angor,
Fungeris angelico sola ministerio.'

'It is almost needless to add,' says Mr. Lockhart, 'there are no such
lines.' _Life of Scott_, iii. 294.

[679] The greater part of this Preface was given in the _Gent. Mag_. for
August 1747 (xvii. 404).

[680] 'Persuasive' is scarcely a fit description for this noble outburst
of indignation on the part of one who knew all the miseries of poverty.
After quoting Dr. Newton's account of the distress to which Milton's
grand-daughter had been reduced, he says:--'That this relation is true
cannot be questioned: but surely the honour of letters, the dignity of
sacred poetry, the spirit of the English nation, and the glory of human
nature require--that it should be true no longer.... In an age, which
amidst all its vices and all its follies has not become infamous for
want of charity, it may be surely allowed to hope, that the living
remains of Milton will be no longer suffered to languish in distress.'
Johnson's _Works_, v. 270.

[681] Hawkins's _Johnson_, p. 275.

[682] In the original _retrospection_. Johnson's _Works_, v. 268.

[683] In this same year Johnson thus ends a severe criticism on _Samson
Agonistes_: 'The everlasting verdure of Milton's laurels has nothing to
fear from the blasts of malignity; nor can my attempt produce any other
effect than to strengthen their shoots by lopping their luxuriance.'
_The Rambler_, No. 140. 'Mr. Nichols shewed Johnson in 1780 a book
called _Remarks on Johnson's Life of Milton_, in which the affair of
Lauder was renewed with virulence. He read the libellous passage with
attention, and instantly wrote on the margin:--"In the business of
Lauder I was deceived; partly by thinking the man too frantic to be
fraudulent.'" Murphy's _Johnson_, p. 66.

[684] 'Johnson turned his house,' writes Lord Macaulay, 'into a place of
refuge for a crowd of wretched old creatures who could find no other
asylum; nor could all their peevishness and ingratitude weary out his
benevolence' (_Essays_, i. 390). In his _Biography of Johnson_ (p. 388)
he says that Mrs. Williams's 'chief recommendations were her blindness
and her poverty.' No doubt in Johnson's letters to Mrs. Thrale are found
amusing accounts of the discord of the inmates of his house. But it is
abundantly clear that in Mrs. Williams's company he had for years found
pleasure. A few months after her death he wrote to Mrs. Thrale: 'You
have more than once wondered at my complaint of solitude, when you hear
that I am crowded with visits. _Inopem me copia fecit_. Visitors are no
proper companions in the chamber of sickness.... The amusements and
consolations of languor and depression are conferred by familiar and
domestic companions.... Such society I had with Levett and Williams'
(_Piozzi Letters_, ii. 341). To Mrs. Montagu he wrote:--'Thirty years
and more she had been my companion, and her death has left me very
desolate' (Croker's _Boswell_, p. 739). Boswell says that 'her departure
left a blank in his house' (_post_, Aug. 1783). 'By her death,' writes
Murphy, 'he was left in a state of destitution, with nobody but his
black servant to soothe his anxious moments' (Murphy's _Johnson_, p.
122). Hawkins (_Life_, p. 558) says that 'she had not only cheered him
in his solitude, and helped him to pass with comfort those hours which
otherwise would have been irksome to him, but had relieved him from
domestic cares, regulated and watched over the expenses of his house,
etc.' 'She had,' as Boswell says (_post_, Aug. 1783), 'valuable
qualities.' 'Had she had,' wrote Johnson, 'good humour and prompt
elocution, her universal curiosity and comprehensive knowledge would
have made her the delight of all that knew her' (_Piozzi Letters_, ii.
311). To Langton he wrote:--'I have lost a companion to whom I have had
recourse for domestic amusement for thirty years, and whose variety of
knowledge never was exhausted' (_post_, Sept. 29, 1783). 'Her
acquisitions,' he wrote to Dr. Burney, 'were many and her curiosity
universal; so that she partook of every conversation' (_post_, Sept.
1783). Murphy (_Life_ p. 72) says:--'She possessed uncommon talents,
and, though blind, had an alacrity of mind that made her conversation
agreeable, and even desirable.' According to Hawkins (_Life_, 322-4)
'she had acquired a knowledge of French and Italian, and had made great
improvements in literature. She was a woman of an enlightened
understanding. Johnson in many exigencies found her an able counsellor,
and seldom shewed his wisdom more than when he hearkened to her advice.'
Perhaps Johnson had her in his thoughts when, writing of Pope's last
years and Martha Blount, he said:--'Their acquaintance began early; the
life of each was pictured on the other's mind; their conversation
therefore was endearing, for when they met there was an immediate
coalition of congenial notions.' (Johnson's _Works_, viii. 304.) Miss
Mulso (Mrs. Chapone) writing to Mrs. Carter in 1753, says:--'I was
charmed with Mr. Johnson's behaviour to Mrs. Williams, which was like
that of a fond father to his daughter. She shewed very good sense, with
a great deal of modesty and humility; and so much patience and
cheerfulness under her misfortune that it doubled my concern for her'
(_Mrs. Chapone's Life_, p. 73). Miss Talbot wrote to Mrs. Carter in
1756:--'My mother the other day fell in love with your friend, Mrs.
Williams, whom we met at Mr. Richardson's [where Miss Mulso also had met
her], and is particularly charmed with the sweetness of her voice'
(Talbot and Carter _Corresp_. ii. 221). Miss Talbot was a niece of Lord
Chancellor Talbot. Hannah More wrote in 1774:--'Mrs. Williams is
engaging in her manners; her conversation lively and entertaining'
(More's _Memoirs_, i.49). Boswell, however, more than once complains
that she was 'peevish' (_post_, Oct. 26, 1769 and April 7, 1776). At a
time when she was very ill, and had gone into the country to try if she
could improve her health, Johnson wrote:--'Age, and sickness, and pride
have made her so peevish, that I was forced to bribe the maid to stay
with her by a secret stipulation of half-a-crown a week over her wages'
(_post_, July 22, 1777). Malone, in a note on August 2, 1763, says that
he thinks she had of her own 'about £35 or £40 a year.' This was in her
latter days; Johnson had prevailed on Garrick to give her a benefit and
Mrs. Montagu to give her a pension. She used, he adds, to help in the
house-work.

[685] March 14. See _ante_, p. 203, note 1. He had grown weary of his
work. In the last _Rambler_ but one he wrote: 'When once our labour has
begun, the comfort that enables us to endure it is the prospect of its
end.... He that is himself weary will soon weary the public. Let him
therefore lay down his employment, whatever it be, who can no longer
exert his former activity or attention; let him not endeavour to
struggle with censure, or obstinately infest the stage, till a general
hiss commands him to depart.'

[686] How successful an imitator Hawkesworth was is shewn by the
following passage in the Carter and Talbot _Corresp_., ii. 109:--'I
discern Mr. Johnson through all the papers that are not marked A, as
evidently as if I saw him through the keyhole with the pen in his hand.'

[687] In the _Rambler_ for Feb. 25 of this year (No. 203) he wrote in
the following melancholy strain:--'Every period of life is obliged to
borrow its happiness from the time to come. In youth we have nothing
past to entertain us, and in age we derive little from retrospect but
hopeless sorrow. Yet the future likewise has its limits which the
imagination dreads to approach, but which we see to be not far distant.
The loss of our friends and companions impresses hourly upon us the
necessity of our own departure; we know that the schemes of man are
quickly at an end, that we must soon lie down in the grave with the
forgotten multitudes of former ages, and yield our place to others, who,
like us, shall be driven a while by hope or fear about the surface of
the earth, and then like us be lost in the shades of death.' In _Prayers
and Meditations_, pp. 12-15, in a service that he used on May 6, 'as
preparatory to my return to life to-morrow,' he prays:--'Enable me to
begin and perfect that reformation which I promised her, and to
persevere in that resolution which she implored Thee to continue, in the
purposes which I recorded in Thy sight when she lay dead before me.' See
_post_, Jan. 20, 1780. The author of _Memoirs of the Life and Writings
of Dr. Johnson_, 1785, says, p. 113, that on the death of his wife, 'to
walk the streets of London was for many a lonesome night Johnson's
constant substitute for sleep.'

[688] 'I have often been inclined to think that, if this fondness of
Johnson for his wife was not dissembled, it was a lesson that he had
learned by rote, and that, when he practised it, he knew not where to
stop till he became ridiculous.' Hawkins's _Johnson_, p. 313

[689] The son of William Strahan, M.P., 'Johnson's old and constant
friend, Printer to His Majesty' (_post_, under April 20, 1781). He
attended Johnson on his death-bed, and published the volume called
_Prayers and Meditations_.

[690] Southey in his _Life of Wesley_, i. 359, writes:--'The universal
attention which has been paid to dreams in all ages proves that the
superstition is natural; and I have heard too many well-attested facts
(facts to which belief could not be refused upon any known laws of
evidence) not to believe that impressions are sometimes made in this
manner, and forewarnings communicated, which cannot be explained by
material philosophy or mere metaphysics.'

[691] Warburton in his _Divine Legation_, i. 284, quotes the 'famous
sepulchral inscription of the Roman widow.' 'Ita peto vos Manes
sanctissimi commendatum habeatis meum conjugem et velitis huic
indulgentissimi esse horis nocturnis ut eum videam,' etc.

[692] Mrs. Boswell died in June 1789. Johnson's prayer with Boswell's
comments on it was first inserted in the _Additions_ to the
second edition.

[693] Mrs. Johnson died on March 17, O. S., or March 28, N. S. The
change of style was made in September, 1752. He might have kept either
the 17th, or the 28th as the anniversary. In like manner, though he was
born on Sept. 7, after the change he kept the 18th as his birth-day. See
_post_, beginning of 1753, where he writes, 'Jan. 1, N. S., which I
shall use for the future.'

[694] In _Prayers and Meditations_, p. 22, he recorded: 'The melancholy
of this day hung long upon me.' P. 53: 'April 22, 1764, Thought on
Tetty, dear, poor Tetty, with my eyes full.' P. 91: 'March 28, 1770.
This is the day on which, in 1752, I was deprived of poor, dear
Tetty.... When I recollect the time in which we lived together, my grief
for her departure is not abated; and I have less pleasure in any good
that befalls me because she does not partake it.' P. 170: 'April 20,
1778. Poor Tetty, whatever were our faults and failings, we loved each
other. I did not forget thee yesterday [Easter Sunday]. Couldest thou
have lived!' P. 210: 'March 28, 1782. This is the day on which, in 1752,
dear Tetty died. I have now uttered a prayer of repentance and
contrition; perhaps Tetty knows that I prayed for her. Perhaps Tetty is
now praying for me. God help me.' In a letter to Mrs. Thrale on the
occasion of the death of her son (dated March 30, 1776) he thus refers
to the loss of his wife:--'I know that a whole system of hopes, and
designs, and expectations is swept away at once, and nothing left but
bottomless vacuity. What you feel I have felt, and hope that your
disquiet will be shorter than mine.' _Piozzi Letters_, i. 310. In a
letter to Mr. Elphinston, who had just lost his wife, written on July
27, 1778, he repeats the same thought:--'A loss such as yours lacerates
the mind, and breaks the whole system of purposes and hopes. It leaves a
dismal vacuity in life, which affords nothing on which the affections
can fix, or to which endeavour may be directed. All this I have known.'
Croker's _Boswell_, p. 66, note. See also _post_, his letter to Mr.
Warton of Dec. 21, 1754, and to Dr. Lawrence of Jan. 20, 1780.

[695] In the usual monthly list of deaths in the _Gent. Mag_. her name
is not given. Johnson did not, I suppose, rank among 'eminent persons.'

[696] Irene, Act i. sc. 1.

[697] See _post_, Nov. 16, 1784, note.

[698] The Anderdon MSS. contain an importunate letter, dated July 3,
1751, from one Mitchell, a tradesman in Chandos-street, pressing Johnson
to pay £2, due by his wife ever since August, 1749, and threatening
legal proceedings to enforce payment. This letter Mr. Boswell had
endorsed, 'Proof of Dr. Johnson's wretched circumstances in
1751.' CROKER.

[699] In the _Gent. Mag_. for February, 1794, (p. 100,) was printed a
letter pretending to be that written by Johnson on the death of his
wife. But it is merely a transcript of the 41st number of _The Idler_. A
fictitious date (March 17, 1751, O. S.) was added by some person
previous to this paper being sent to the publisher of that miscellany,
to give a colour to this deception. MALONE.

[700] Francis Barber was born in Jamaica, and was brought to England in
1750 by Colonel Bathurst, father of Johnson's very intimate friend, Dr.
Bathurst. He was sent, for some time, to the Reverend Mr. Jackson's
school, at Barton, in Yorkshire. The Colonel by his will left him his
freedom, and Dr. Bathurst was willing that he should enter into
Johnson's service, in which he continued from 1752 till Johnson's death,
with the exception of two intervals; in one of which, upon some
difference with his master, he went and served an apothecary in
Cheapside, but still visited Dr. Johnson occasionally; in another, he
took a fancy to go to sea. Part of the time, indeed, he was, by the
kindness of his master, at a school in Northamptonshire, that he might
have the advantage of some learning. So early and so lasting a
connection was there between Dr. Johnson and this humble friend.
BOSWELL. 'I believe that Francis was scarcely as much the object of Mr.
Johnson's personal kindness as the representative of Dr. Bathurst, for
whose sake he would have loved anybody or anything.' Piozzi's _Anec_.
p. 212.

[701] 'I asked him,' writes Mrs. Piozzi (_Anec_. pp. 146-150), 'if he
ever disputed with his wife. "Perpetually," said he; "my wife had a
particular reverence for cleanliness, and desired the praise of neatness
in her dress and furniture, as many ladies do, till they become
troublesome to their best friends, slaves to their own besoms, and only
sigh for the hour of sweeping their husbands out of the house as dirt
and useless lumber. A clean floor is so comfortable, she would say
sometimes by way of twitting; till at last I told her that I thought we
had had talk enough about the floor, we would now have a touch at the
ceiling." I asked him if he ever huffed his wife about his dinner. "So
often," replied he, "that at last she called to me and said, Nay, hold,
Mr. Johnson, and do not make a farce of thanking God for a dinner which
in a few minutes you will protest not eatable."'

[702] 'When a friend is carried to his grave, we at once find excuses
for every weakness, and palliations of every fault; we recollect a
thousand endearments, which before glided off our minds without
impression, a thousand favours unrepaid, a thousand duties unperformed;
and wish, vainly wish, for his return, not so much that we may receive,
as that we may bestow happiness, and recompense that kindness which
before we never understood.' _Rambler_, No. 54.

[703] _Pr. and Med_. p. 19. BOSWELL.

[704] Hawkins's _Life of Johnson_, p. 316. BOSWELL.

[705] See _post_, Oct. 26, 1769, where the Roman Catholic doctrine of
purgatory or 'a middle state,' as Johnson calls it is discussed, and
Boswell's _Hebrides_, Oct. 25, 1773.

[706] In the original, 'lawful _for_ me.' Much the same prayer Johnson
made for his mother. _Pr. and Med_. p. 38. On Easter Day, 1764, he
records:--'After sermon I recommended Tetty in a prayer by herself; and
my father, mother, brother, and Bathurst in another. I did it only once,
so far as it might be lawful for me.' _Ib_. p. 54. On the death of Mr.
Thrale he wrote, 'May God that delighteth in mercy _have had_ mercy on
thee.' _Ib_. p. 191; and later on, 'for Henry Thrale, so far as is
lawful, I humbly implore thy mercy in his present state.' _Ib_. p. 197.

[707] _Pr. and Med_., p. 20. BOSWELL.

[708] Shortly before his death (see _post,_ July 12, 1784) Johnson had a
stone placed over her grave with the following inscription:--

Hic conduntur reliquiae
ELIZABETHÆ
Antiqua Jarvisiorum Leicestrienses, ortae;
Formosae, cultae, ingeniosae, piae;
Uxoris, primis nuptiis, Henrici Porter,
Secundis Samuelis Johnson:
Qui multum amatam, diuque defletam
Hoc lapide contexit.
Obiit Londini Mense Mart.
A.D. MDCCLIII

As Mrs. Johnson died in 1752, the date is wrong.

[709] See _post_, Sept. 21. 1777.

[710] He described her as a woman 'whom none, who were capable of
distinguishing either moral or intellectual excellence, could know
without esteem or tenderness. She was extensively charitable in her
judgements and opinions, grateful for every kindness that she received,
and willing to impart assistance of every kind to all whom her little
power enabled her to benefit. She passed through many months of languor,
weakness, and decay without a single murmur of impatience, and often
expressed her adoration of that mercy which granted her so long time for
recollection and penitence.' Johnson's _Works,_ ix. 523.

[711] See _ante_, p. 187.

[712] Dr. Bathurst, though a Physician of no inconsiderable merit, had
not the good fortune to get much practice in London. He was, therefore
willing to accept of employment abroad, and, to the regret of all who
knew him, fell a sacrifice to the destructive climate, in the expedition
against the Havannah. Mr. Langton recollects the following passage in a
letter from Dr. Johnson to Mr. Beauclerk: 'The Havannah is taken;--a
conquest too dearly obtained; for, Bathurst died before it. "_Vix
Priamus tanti totaque Troja fuit_."' BOSWELL.

The quotation is from Ovid, _Heroides_, i. 4. Johnson (_post_, Dec. 21,
1762) wrote to Baretti, 'Bathurst went physician to the army, and died
at the Havannah.' Mr. Harwood in his _History of Lichfield_, p. 451,
gives two letters from Bathurst to Johnson dated 1757. In the postscript
to one he says:--'I know you will call me a lazy dog, and in truth I
deserve it; but I am afraid I shall never mend. I have indeed long known
that I can love my friends without being able to tell them so.... Adieu
my dearest friend.' He calls Johnson 'the best of friends, to whom I
stand indebted for all the little virtue and knowledge that I have.'
'Nothing,' he continues, 'I think, but absolute want can force me to
continue where I am.' Jamaica he calls 'this execrable region.' Hawkins
(_Life_, p. 235) says that 'Bathurst, before leaving England, confessed
to Johnson that in the course of ten years' exercise of his faculty he
had never opened his hand to more than one guinea.' Johnson perhaps had
Bathurst in mind when, many years later, he wrote:--'A physician in a
great city seems to be the mere plaything of fortune; his degree of
reputation is for the most part totally casual; they that employ him
know not his excellence; they that reject him know not his deficience.
By any acute observer, who had looked on the transactions of the medical
world for half a century, a very curious book might be written on the
_Fortune of Physicians_.' _Works_, viii. 471.

[713] Mr. Ryland was one of the members of the old club in Ivy Lane who
met to dine in 1783. Mr. Payne was another, (_post_, end of 1783).

[714] Johnson revised her volumes: _post_, under Nov. 19, 1783.

[715] Catherine Sawbridge, sister of Mrs. [? Mr.] Alderman Sawbridge,
was born in 1733; but it was not till 1760 that she was married to Dr.
Macaulay, a physician; so that Barber's account was incorrect either in
date or name. CROKER. For Alderman Sawbridge see _post_, May 17,
1778, note.

[716] See _post_, under Nov. 19, 1783. Johnson bequeathed to her a book
to keep as a token of remembrance (_post_, Dec. 9, 1784). I find her
name in the year 1765 in the list of subscribers to the edition of
Swift's _Works_, in 17 vols., so that perhaps she was more 'in the
learned way' than Barber thought.

[717] Reynolds did not return to England from Italy till the October of
this year, seven months after Mrs. Johnson's death. Taylor's _Reynolds_,
i. 87. He writes of his 'thirty years' intimacy with Dr. Johnson.' He
must have known him therefore at least as early as 1754. _Ib_. ii. 454.

[718] See _ante_, p. 185.

[719] 'Lord Southwell,' said Johnson, 'was the most _qualitied_ man I
ever saw.' _Post_, March 23, 1783.

[720] The account given of Levet in _Gent. Mag_. lv. 101, shews that he
was a man out of the common run. He would not otherwise have attracted
the notice of the French surgeons. The writer says:--'Mr. Levet, though
an Englishman by birth, became early in life a waiter at a coffee-house
in Paris. The surgeons who frequented it, finding him of an inquisitive
turn and attentive to their conversation, made a purse for him, and gave
him some instructions in their art. They afterwards furnished him with
the means of further knowledge, by procuring him free admission to such
lectures in pharmacy and anatomy as were read by the ablest professors
of that period.' When he lived with Johnson, 'much of the day was
employed in attendance on his patients, who were chiefly of the lowest
rank of tradesmen. The remainder of his hours he dedicated to Hunter's
lectures, and to as many different opportunities of improvement as he
could meet with on the same gratuitous conditions.' 'All his medical
knowledge,' said Johnson, 'and it is not inconsiderable, was obtained
through the ear. Though he buys books, he seldom looks into them, or
discovers any power by which he can be supposed to judge of an author's
merit.' 'Dr. Johnson has frequently observed that Levet was indebted to
him for nothing more than house-room, his share in a penny-loaf at
breakfast, and now and then a dinner on a Sunday. His character was
rendered valuable by repeated proof of honesty, tenderness, and
gratitude to his benefactor, as well as by an unwearied diligence in his
profession. His single failing was an occasional departure from
sobriety. Johnson would observe, "he was perhaps the only man who ever
became intoxicated through motives of prudence. He reflected that, if he
refused the gin or brandy offered him by some of his patients, he could
have been no gainer by their cure, as they might have had nothing else
to bestow on him. This habit of taking a fee, in whatever shape it was
exhibited, could not be put off by advice. He would swallow what he did
not like, nay what he knew would injure him, rather than go home with an
idea that his skill had been exerted without recompense. Though he took
all that was offered him, he demanded nothing from the poor."' The
writer adds that 'Johnson never wished him to be regarded as an
inferior, or treated him like a dependent.' Mrs. Piozzi says:--'When
Johnson raised contributions for some distressed author, or wit in want,
he often made us all more than amends by diverting descriptions of the
lives they were then passing in corners unseen by anybody but himself,
and that odd old surgeon whom he kept in his house to tend the

'Levet, madam, is a brutal fellow, but I have a good regard for him; for
his brutality is in his manners, not in his mind.' Mme. D'Arblay's

and Levet at breakfast, Johnson, in deshabille, as just risen from bed,
and Levet filling out tea for himself and his patron alternately, no
conversation passing between them. All that visited him at these hours
were welcome. A night's rest and breakfast seldom failed to refresh and
fit him for discourse, and whoever withdrew went too soon.' Hawkins's
_Johnson_, p. 435.

[722] It was in 1738 that Johnson was living in Castle Street. At the
time of Reynolds's arrival in London in 1752 he had been living for some
years in Gough Square. Boswell, I suppose, only means to say that
Johnson's acquaintance with the Cotterells was formed when he lived in
their neighbourhood. Northcote (_Life of Reynolds_, i. 69) says that the
Cotterells lived 'opposite to Reynolds's,' but his account seems based
on a misunderstanding of Boswell.

[723] _Ante_, p. 165.

[724] 'We are both of Dr. Johnson's school,' wrote Reynolds to some
friend. 'For my own part, I acknowledge the highest obligations to him.
He may be said to have formed my mind, and to have brushed from it a
great deal of rubbish. Those very persons whom he has brought to think
rightly will occasionally criticise the opinions of their master when he
nods. But we should always recollect that it is he himself who taught us
and enabled us to do it.' Taylor's _Reynolds_, ii. 461. Burke, writing
to Malone, said:--'You state very properly how much Reynolds owed to the
writings and conversation of Johnson; and nothing shews more the
greatness of Sir Joshua's parts than his taking advantage of both, and
making some application of them to his profession, when Johnson neither
understood nor desired to understand anything of painting.' _Ib_. p.
638. Reynolds, there can be little question, is thinking of Johnson in
the following passage in his _Seventh Discourse_:--'What partial and
desultory reading cannot afford may be supplied by the conversation of
learned and ingenious men, which is the best of all substitutes for
those who have not the means or opportunities of deep study. There are
many such men in this age: and they will be pleased with communicating
their ideas to artists, when they see them curious and docile, if they
are treated with that respect and deference which is so justly their
due. Into such society young artists, if they make it the point of their
ambition, will by degrees be admitted. There, without formal teaching,
they will insensibly come to feel and reason like those they live with,
and find a rational and systematic taste imperceptibly formed in their
minds, which they will know how to reduce to a standard, by applying
general truth to their own purposes, better perhaps than those to whom
they owned [?owed] the original sentiment.' Reynolds's _Works_, edit.
1824, i. 149. 'Another thing remarkable to shew how little Sir Joshua
crouched to the great is, that he never gave them their proper titles. I
never heard the words "your lordship" or "your ladyship" come from his
mouth; nor did he ever say "Sir" in speaking to any one but Dr. Johnson;
and when he did not hear distinctly what the latter said (which often
happened) he would then say "Sir?" that he might repeat it.' Northcote's
_Conversations_, p. 289. Gibbon called Johnson 'Reynolds's oracle.'
Gibbon's _Misc. Works_, i. 149. See also _post_, under Dec. 29, 1778.

[725] The thought may have been suggested to Reynolds by Johnson's
writings. In _The Rambler_, No. 87, he had said:--'There are minds so
impatient of inferiority, that their gratitude is a species of revenge,
and they return benefits, not because recompense is a pleasure, but
because obligation is a pain.' In No. 166, he says:--'To be obliged is
to be in some respect inferior to another.'

[726] Northcote tells the following story on the authority of Miss
Reynolds. It is to be noticed, however, that in her _Recollections_
(Croker's _Boswell_, p. 832) the story is told somewhat differently.
Johnson, Reynolds and Miss Reynolds one day called on the Miss
Cotterells. 'Johnson was the last of the three that came in; when the
maid, seeing this uncouth and dirty figure of a man, and not conceiving
he could be one of the company, laid hold of his coat, just as he was
going up-stairs, and pulled him back again, saying, "You fellow, what is
your business here? I suppose you intended to rob the house." This most
unlucky accident threw him into such a fit of shame and anger that he
roared out like a bull, "What have I done? What have I done?"'
Northcote's _Reynolds_, i. 73.

[727] Johnson writing to Langton on January 9, 1759, describes him as
'towering in the confidence of twenty-one.' The conclusion of _The
Rambler_ was in March 1752, when Langton must have been only fourteen or
just fifteen at most; Johnson's first letter to him dated May 6, 1755,
shews that at that time their acquaintance had been but short. Langton's
subscription to the Thirty-nine Articles in the Register of the
University of Oxford was on July 7, 1757. Johnson's first letter to him
at Oxford is dated June 28, 1757.

[728] See _post_, March 20, 1782.

[729] 'My friend Maltby and I,' said Samuel Rogers, 'when we were very
young men, had a strong desire to see Dr. Johnson; and we determined to
call upon him, and introduce ourselves. We accordingly proceeded to his
house in Bolt Court; and I had my hand on the knocker when our courage
failed us, and we retreated. Many years afterwards I mentioned this
circumstance to Boswell, who said, "What a pity that you did not go
boldly in! He would have received you with all kindness."' Rogers's
_Table Talk_, p. 9. For Johnson's levee see _post_, 1770, in Dr.
Maxwell's _Collectanea_.

[730] 'George Langton,' writes Mr. Best in his _Memorials_ (p. 66),
'shewed me his pedigree with the names and arms of the families with
which his own had intermarried. It was engrossed on a piece of parchment
about ten inches broad, and twelve to fifteen feet long. "It leaves off
at the reign of Queen Elizabeth," said he.'

[731] Topham Beauclerk was the only son of Lord Sidney Beauclerk, fifth
son of the first Duke of St. Alban's. He was therefore the
great-grandson of Charles II. and Nell Gwynne. He was born in Dec. 1739.
In my _Dr. Johnson: His Friends and his Critics_ I have put together
such facts as I could find about Langton and Beauclerk.

[732] Mr. Best describes Langton as 'a very tall, meagre, long-visaged
man, much resembling a stork standing on one leg near the shore in
Raphael's cartoon of the Miraculous Draught of Fishes. His manners were,
in the highest degree, polished; his conversation mild, equable and
always pleasing.' Best's _Memorials_, p. 62. Miss Hawkins writes:--'If I
were called on to name the person with whom Johnson might have been seen
to the fairest advantage, I should certainly name Mr. Langton.' Miss
Hawkins's _Memoirs_, i. 144. Mrs. Piozzi wrote in 1817:--'I remember
when to have Langton at a man's house stamped him at once a literary
character.' Hayward's _Piozzi_, ii. 203.

[733] In the summer of 1759. See _post_, under April 15, 1758, and 1759.

[734] Lord Charlemont said that 'Beauclerk possessed an exquisite taste,
various accomplishments, and the most perfect good breeding. He was
eccentric, often querulous, entertaining a contempt for the generality
of the world, which the politeness of his manners could not always
conceal; but to those whom he liked most generous and friendly. Devoted
at one time to pleasure, at another to literature, sometimes absorbed in
play, sometimes in books, he was altogether one of the most
accomplished, and when in good humour and surrounded by those who suited
his fancy, one of the most agreeable men that could possibly exist.'
Lord Charlemont's _Life_, i. 210. Hawkins writes (_Life_, p. 422) that
'over all his behaviour there beamed such a sunshine of cheerfulness and
good-humour as communicated itself to all around him.' Mrs. Piozzi said
of him:--'Topham Beauclerk (wicked and profligate as he wished to be
accounted) was yet a man of very strict veracity. Oh Lord! how I did
hate that horrid Beauclerk.' Hayward's _Piozzi_, i. 348. Rogers
(_Table-Talk_, p. 40) said that 'Beauclerk was a strangely absent
person.' He once went to dress for a dinner-party in his own house. 'He
forgot all about his guests; thought that it was bed-time, and got into
bed. His servant, coming to tell him that his guests were waiting for
him, found him fast asleep.'

[735] It was to the Round-house that Captain Booth was first taken in
Fielding's _Amelia_, Book i, chap. 2.

[737] In the college which _The Club_ was to set up at St. Andrew's,
Beauclerk was to have the chair of natural philosophy. Boswell's
_Hebrides_, Aug. 25, 1773. Goldsmith, writing to Langton in 1771, says:
'Mr. Beauclerk is now going directly forward to become a second Boyle;
deep in chymistry and physics.' Forster's _Goldsmith_, ii. 283. Boswell
described to Temple, in 1775, Beauclerk's villa at Muswell Hill, with
its 'observatory, laboratory for chymical experiments.' Boswell's
_Letters_, p. 194.

[740] Mr. Langton has recollected, or Dr. Johnson repeated, the passage
wrong. The lines are in Lord Lansdowne's Drinking Song to Sleep, and
run thus:--

'Short, very short be then thy reign,
For I'm in haste to laugh and drink again.' BOSWELL.

Lord Lansdowne was the Granville of Pope's couplet--

'But why then publish? Granville the polite,
And knowing Walsh, would tell me I could write.'

_Prologue to the Satires,_ 1.135.

[741] Boswell in _Hebrides_ (Aug. 18, 1773) says that Johnson, on
starting from Edinburgh, left behind in an open drawer in Boswell's
house 'one volume of a pretty full and curious Diary of his life, of
which I have a few fragments.' He also states (_post_, under Dec 9,
1784):--'I owned to him, that having accidentally seen them [two quarto
volumes of his _Life_] I had read a great deal in them.' It would seem
that he had also transcribed a portion.

[742] This is inconsistent with what immediately follows, for No. 39 on
Sleep was published on March 20.

[743] Hawkesworth in the last number of _The Adventurer_ says that he
had help at first from A.; 'but this resource soon failing, I was
obliged to carry on the publication alone, except some casual supplies,
till I obtained from the gentlemen who have distinguished their papers
by T and Z, such assistance as I most wished.' In a note he says that
the papers signed Z are by the Rev. Mr. Warton. The papers signed A are
written in a light style. In Southey's _Cowper_, i. 47, it is said that
Bonnell Thornton wrote them.

[744] Boswell had read the passage carelessly. Statius is mentioned, but
the writer goes on to quote _Cowley_, whose Latin lines C. B. has
translated. Johnson's _Works_, iv. 10.

[745] Malone says that 'Johnson was fond of him, but latterly owned that
Hawkesworth--who had set out a modest, humble man--was one of the many
whom success in the world had spoiled. He was latterly, as Sir Joshua
Reynolds told me, an affected insincere man, and a great coscomb in his
dress. He had no literature whatever.' Prior's _Malone_, p. 441. See
_post_, April 11 and May 7, 1773, and Boswell's _Hebrides_, Oct. 3.

[746] 'Johnson's statement to Warton is definite and is borne out by
internal evidence, if internal evidence can be needful when he had once
made a definite statement. The papers signed _Misargyrus_, the first of
which appeared on March 3, are all below his style. They were not, I
feel sure, written by him, and are improperly given in the Oxford
edition of his works. I do not find in them even any traces of his hand.
The paper on Sleep, No. 39, is I am almost sure, partly his, but I
believe it is not wholly. In the frequency of quotations in the first
part of it I see another, and probably a younger author. The passage on
the 'low drudgery of digesting dictionaries' is almost certainly his.
Dr. Bathurst, perhaps, wrote the Essay, and Johnson corrected it.
Whether it was Johnson's or not, it was published after the letter to
Dr. Warton was written.

[747] See _post_, April 25, 1778, for an instance where Johnson's
silence did not imply assent.

[748] 'One evening at the Club Johnson proposed to us the celebrating
the birth of Mrs. Lennox's first literary child, as he called her book,
[_The Life of Harriet Stuart_, a novel, published Dec. 1750] by a whole
night spent in festivity. Our supper was elegant, and Johnson had
directed that a magnificent hot apple-pie should make a part of it, and
this he would have stuck with bay-leaves, because, forsooth, Mrs. Lennox
was an authoress, and had written verses; and further, he had prepared
for her a crown of laurel, with which, but not till he had invoked the
Muses by some ceremonies of his own invention, he encircled her brows.
About five Johnson's face shone with meridian splendour, though his
drink had been only lemonade.' Hawkins's _Johnson_, p. 286. See _post_,
1780, in Mr. Langton's 'Collection,' and May 15, 1784.

[749] In a document in the possession of one of Cave's collateral
descendants which I have seen dated May 3, 1754, and headed, 'Present
state of the late Mr. Edward Cave's effects,' I found entered
'_Magazine_, £3,000. _Daily Advertiser_, £900.' The total value of the
effects was £8,708.

[750] Johnson records of his friend that 'one of the last acts of reason
which he exerted was fondly to press the hand that is now writing this
little narrative.' _Works_, vi. 433.

[751] See Hawkins's _Johnson_, p. 189.

[752] Lord Chesterfield writing to his son in 1751 (_Letters_, iii. 136)
said:--'People in high life are hardened to the wants and distresses of
mankind, as surgeons are to their bodily pains; they see and hear of
them all day long, and even of so many simulated ones, that they do not
know which has are real, and which are not. Other sentiments are
therefore to be applied to than those of mere justice and humanity;
their favour must be captivated by the _suaviter in modo_; their love of
ease disturbed by unwearied importunity; or their fears wrought upon by
a decent intimation of implacable, cool resentment: this is the true
_fortiter in re_! He was himself to experience an instance of the true
_fortiter in re_.

[753] If Lord Chesterfield had read the last number of _The Rambler_
(published in March, 1752) he could scarcely have flattered himself with
these expectations. Johnson, after saying that he would not endeavour to
overbear the censures of criticism by the influence of a patron,
added:--'The supplications of an author never yet reprieved him a moment
from oblivion; and, though greatness sometimes sheltered guilt, it can
afford no protection to ignorance or dulness. Having hitherto attempted
only the propagation of truth, I will not at last violate it by the
confession of terrors which I do not feel; having laboured to maintain
the dignity of virtue, I will not now degrade it by the meanness of
dedication.'

[754] On Nov. 28 and Dec. 5, 1754. _The World_, by Adam Fitz-Adam, Jan.
1753 to Dec. 1765. The editor was Edward Moore. Among the contributors
were the Earls of Chesterfield and Corke, Horace Walpole, R. O.
Cambridge, and Soame Jenyns. See _post_, July 1, 1763.

[755] With these papers as a whole Johnson would have been highly
offended. The anonymous writer hopes that his readers will not suspect
him 'of being a hired and interested puff of this work.' 'I most
solemnly protest,' he goes on to say, 'that neither Mr. Johnson, nor any
booksellers have ever offered me the usual compliment of a pair of
gloves or a bottle of wine.' It is a pretty piece of irony for a wealthy
nobleman solemnly to protest that he has not been bribed by a poor
author, whom seven years before he had repulsed from his door. But
Chesterfield did worse than this. By way of recommending a work of so
much learning and so much labour he tells a foolish story of an
assignation that had failed 'between a fine gentleman and a fine lady.'
The letter that had passed between them had been badly spelt, and they
had gone to different houses. 'Such examples,' he wrote, 'really make
one tremble; and will, I am convinced, determine my fair fellow-subjects
and their adherents to adopt and scrupulously conform to Mr. Johnson's
rules of true orthography.' Johnson, in the last year of his life, at a
time of great weakness and depression, defended the roughness of his
manner. 'I have done more good as I am. Obscenity and impiety have
always been repressed in my company' (_post_, June 11, 1784).

[756] In the original 'Mr. Johnson.'

[757] In the original 'unnecessary foreign ornaments.'

[758] In the original, 'will now, and, I dare say.'

[759] Hawkins (_Life_, p. 191) says that Chesterfield, further to
appease Johnson, sent to him Sir Thomas Robinson (see _post_, July 19,
1763), who was 'to apologise for his lordship's treatment of him, and to
make him tenders of his future friendship and patronage. Sir Thomas,
whose talent was flattery, was profuse in his commendations of Johnson
and his writings, and declared that, were his circumstances other than
they were, himself would settle £500 a year on him. 'And who are you,'
asked Johnson, 'that talk thus liberally?' 'I am,' said the other, 'Sir
Thomas Robinson, a Yorkshire baronet.' 'Sir,' replied Johnson, 'if the
first peer of the realm were to make me such an offer, I would shew him
the way down stairs.'

[760] _Paradise Lost_, ii. 112.

[761] Johnson, perhaps, was thinking of his interviews with
Chesterfield, when in his _Rambler_ on 'The Mischiefs of following a
Patron' (No. 163) he wrote:--'If you, Mr. Rambler, have ever ventured
your philosophy within the attraction of greatness, you know the force
of such language, introduced with a smile of gracious tenderness, and
impressed at the conclusion with an air of solemn sincerity.'

[762] Johnson said to Garrick:--'I have sailed a long and painful voyage
round the world of the English language; and does he now send out two
cock-boats to tow me into harbour?' Murphy's _Johnson_, p. 74. This
metaphor may perhaps have been suggested to Johnson by Warburton. 'I now
begin to see land, after having wandered, according to Mr. Warburton's
phrase, in this vast sea of words.' _Post_, Feb. 1, 1755.

[763] See _post_, Nov. 22, 1779, and April 8, 1780. Sir Henry Ellis says
that 'address' in Johnson's own copy of his letter to Lord Chesterfield
is spelt twice with one _d_. Croker's _Corres_. ii. 44. In the series of
Letters by Johnson given in _Notes and Queries_, 6th S. v, Johnson
writes _persuit_ (p. 325); 'I cannot _butt_ (p. 342); 'to retain
_council_' (p. 343); _harrassed_ (p. 423); _imbecillity_ (p. 482). In a
letter to Nichols quoted by me, _post_, beginning of 1783, he writes
_ilness_. He commonly, perhaps always, spelt _Boswell Boswel_, and
Nichols's name in one series of letters he spelt Nichols, Nichol, and
Nicol. _Post_, beginning of 1781, note.

[764] Dr. Johnson appeared to have had a remarkable delicacy with
respect to the circulation of this letter; for Dr. Douglas, Bishop of
Salisbury, informs me that, having many years ago pressed him to be
allowed to read it to the second Lord Hardwicke, who was very desirous
to hear it (promising at the same time, that no copy of it should be
taken), Johnson seemed much pleased that it had attracted the attention
of a nobleman of such a respectable character; but after pausing some
time, declined to comply with the request, saying, with a smile, 'No,
Sir; I have hurt the dog too much already;' or words to that
purpose. BOSWELL.

[765] See _post_, June 4, 1781.

[766] In 1790, the year before the _Life of Johnson_ came out, Boswell
published this letter in a separate sheet of four quarto pages under the
following title:--_The celebrated Letter from Samuel Johnson, LL.D., to
Philip Dormer Stanhope, Earl of Chesterfield; Now first published with
Notes, by James Boswell, Esq., London. Printed by Henry Baldwin: for
Charles Dilly in the Poultry, MDCCXC. Price Half-a-Guinea. Entered in
the Hall-Book of the Company of Stationers_. It belongs to the same
impression as _The Life of Johnson_.

[767] 'Je chante le vainqueur des vainqueurs de la terre.' Boileau,
_L'Art poétique_, iii. 272.

[768] The following note is subjoined by Mr. Langton:--'Dr. Johnson,
when he gave me this copy of his letter, desired that I would annex to
it his information to me, that whereas it is said in the letter that "no
assistance has been received," he did once receive from Lord
Chesterfield the sum of ten pounds; but as that was so inconsiderable a
sum, he thought the mention of it could not properly find place in a
letter of the kind that this was.' BOSWELL. 'This surely is an
unsatisfactory excuse,' writes Mr. Croker. He read Johnson's letter
carelessly, as the rest of his note shews. Johnson says, that during the
seven years that had passed since he was repulsed from Chesterfield's
door he had pushed on his work without one act of assistance. These ten
pounds, we may feel sure, had been received before the seven years began
to run. No doubt they had been given in 1747 as an acknowledgement of
the compliment paid to Chesterfield in the _Plan_. He had at first been
misled by Chesterfield's one act of kindness, but he had long had his
eyes opened. Like the shepherd in Virgil (_Eclogues_, viii. 43) he could
say:--'_Nunc_ scio quid sit Amor.'

[769] In this passage Dr. Johnson evidently alludes to the loss of his
wife. We find the same tender recollection recurring to his mind upon
innumerable occasions: and, perhaps no man ever more forcibly felt the
truth of the sentiment so elegantly expressed by my friend Mr. Malone,
in his Prologue to Mr. Jephson's tragedy of JULIA [_Julia or the Italian
Lover_ was acted for the first time on April 17, 1787. _Gent. Mag_.
1787, p. 354]:--

'Vain--wealth, and fame, and fortune's fostering care,
If no fond breast the splendid blessings share;
And, each day's bustling pageantry once past,
There, only there, our bliss is found at last.' BOSWELL.

Three years earlier, when his wife was dying, he had written in one of
the last _Ramblers_ (No 203):--'It is necessary to the completion of
every good, that it be timely obtained; for whatever comes at the close
of life will come too late to give much delight ... What we acquire by
bravery or science, by mental or corporal diligence, comes at last when
we cannot communicate, and therefore cannot enjoy it.' Chesterfield
himself was in no happy state. Less than a month before he received
Johnson's letter he wrote (_Works_, iii. 308):--'For these six months
past, it seems as if all the complaints that ever attacked heads had
joined to overpower mine. Continual noises, headache, giddiness, and
impenetrable deafness; I could not stoop to write; and even reading, the
only resource of the deaf, was painful to me.' He wrote to his son a
year earlier (_Letters_, iv. 43), 'Reading, which was always a pleasure
to me in the time even of my greatest dissipation, is now become my only
refuge; and I fear I indulge it too much at the expense of my eyes. But
what can I do? I must do something. I cannot bear absolute idleness; my
ears grow every day more useless to me, my eyes consequently more
necessary. I will not hoard them like a miser, but will rather risk the
loss than not enjoy the use of them.'

[770] '_The English Dictionary_ was written with little assistance of
the learned, and without any patronage of the great; not in the soft
obscurities of retirement, or under the shelter of academick bowers, but
amidst inconvenience and distraction, in sickness and in sorrow.'
Johnson's _Works_ v. 51.

[771] Upon comparing this copy with that which Dr. Johnson dictated to
me from recollection, the variations are found to be so slight, that
this must be added to the many other proofs which he gave of the
wonderful extent and accuracy of his memory. To gratify the curious in
composition, I have deposited both the copies in the British
Museum. BOSWELL.

[772] Soon after Edwards's _Canons of Criticism_ came out, Johnson was
dining at Tonson the Bookseller's with Hayman the Painter and some more
company. Hayman related to Sir Joshua Reynolds, that the conversation
having turned upon Edwards's book, the gentlemen praised it much, and
Johnson allowed its merit. But when they went farther, and appeared to
put that author upon a level with Warburton, 'Nay, (said Johnson,) he
has given him some smart hits to be sure; but there is no proportion
between the two men; they must not be named together. A fly, Sir, may
sting a stately horse and make him wince; but one is but an insect, and
the other is a horse still.' BOSWELL. Johnson in his _Preface to
Shakespeare_ (_Works_, v. 141) wrote:--'Dr. Warburton's chief assailants
are the authors of _The Canons of Criticism_, and of _The Revisal of
Shakespeare's Text_.... The one stings like a fly, sucks a little blood,
takes a gay flutter and returns for more; the other bites like a
viper.... When I think on one with his confederates, I remember the
danger of Coriolanus, who was afraid that "girls with spits, and boys
with stones, should slay him in puny battle;" when the other crosses my
imagination, I remember the prodigy in _Macbeth_:

"A falcon tow'ring in his pride of place,
Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd."

Let me, however, do them justice. One is a wit and one a scholar.'

[773] To Johnson might be applied what he himself said of Dryden:--'He
appears to have known in its whole extent the dignity of his character,
and to have set a very high value on his own powers and performances.'
_Works_, vii. 291.

[774] In the original _Yet mark_.

[775] In the original _Toil_.

[776] In his _Dictionary_ he defined _patron_ as 'commonly a wretch who
supports with insolence and is paid with flattery.' This definition
disappears in the _Abridgement_, but remains in the fourth edition.

[777] Chesterfield, when he read Johnson's letter to Dodsley, was acting
up to the advice that he had given his own son six years earlier
(_Letters_, ii. 172):--'When things of this kind [bons mots] happen to
be said of you, the most prudent way is to seem not to suppose that they
are meant at you, but to dissemble and conceal whatever degree of anger
you may feel inwardly: and, should they be so plain, that you cannot be
supposed ignorant of their meaning, so join in the laugh of the company
against yourself; acknowledge the hit to be a fair one, and the jest a
good one, and play off the whole thing in seeming good humour; but by no
means reply in the same way; which only shows that you are hurt, and
publishes the victory which you might have concealed.'

[778] See _post_, March 23, 1783, where Johnson said that 'Lord
Chesterfield was dignified, but he was insolent;' and June 27, 1784,
where he said that 'his manner was exquisitely elegant.'

[779]

'Whate'er of mongrel no one class admits,
A wit with dunces, and a dunce with wits.'

Pope's _Dunciad_, iv. 90.

'A true choice spirit we admit;
With wits a fool, with fools a wit.'

Churchill's _Duellist_' Book iii.

'The solemn fop, significant and budge;
A fool with judges, amongst fools a judge.'

Cowper's _Poems_, _Conversation_, 1. 299.

According to Rebecca Warner (_Original Letters_, p. 204), Johnson
telling Joseph Fowke about his refusal to dedicate his _Dictionary_ to
Chesterfield, said: 'Sir, I found I must have gilded a rotten post.'

[780] That collection of letters cannot be vindicated from the serious
charge of encouraging, in some passages, one of the vices most
destructive to the good order and comfort of society, which his Lordship
represents as mere fashionable gallantry; and, in others, of inculcating
the base practice of dissimulation, and recommending, with
disproportionate anxiety, a perpetual attention to external elegance of
manners. But it must, at the same time, be allowed, that they contain
many good precepts of conduct, and much genuine information upon life
and manners, very happily expressed; and that there was considerable
merit in paying so much attention to the improvement of one who was
dependent upon his Lordship's protection; it has, probably, been
exceeded in no instance by the most exemplary parent; and though I can
by no means approve of confounding the distinction between lawful and
illicit offspring, which is, in effect, insulting the civil
establishment of our country, to look no higher; I cannot help thinking
it laudable to be kindly attentive to those, of whose existence we have,
in any way, been the cause. Mr. Stanhope's character has been unjustly
represented as diametrically opposite to what Lord Chesterfield wished
him to be. He has been called dull, gross, and awkward; but I knew him
at Dresden, when he was Envoy to that court; and though he could not
boast of the _graces_, he was, in truth, a sensible, civil, well-behaved
man. BOSWELL. See _post_, March 28, 1775, under April, 29, 1776, and
June 27, 1784.

[781] Chesterfield's _Letters_, iii. 129.

[782] Now one of his Majesty's principal Secretaries of State. BOSWELL.
Afterwards Viscount Melville.

[783] Probably George, second Earl of Macclesfield, who was, in 1752,
elected President of the Royal Society. CROKER. Horace Walpole
(_Letters_, ii. 321) mentions him as 'engaged to a party for finding out
the longitude.'

[784] In another work (_Dr. Johnson: His Friends and his Critics_, p.
214), I have shewn that Lord Chesterfield's 'Respectable Hottentot' was
not Johnson. From the beginning of 1748 to the end of 1754 Chesterfield
had no dealings of any kind with Johnson. At no time had there been the
slightest intimacy between the great nobleman and the poor author.
Chesterfield had never seen Johnson eat. The letter in which the
character is drawn opens with the epigram:

Non amo te, Sabidi, nee possum dicere quare,
Hoc tantum possum dicere, non amo te.

Chesterfield goes on to show 'how it is possible not to love anybody,
and yet not to know the reason why.... How often,' he says, 'have I, in
the course of my life, found myself in this situation with regard to
many of my acquaintance whom I have honoured and respected, without
being able to love.' He then instances the case of the man whom he
describes as a respectable Hottentot. It is clear that he is writing of
a man whom he knows well and who has some claim upon his affection.
Twice he says that it is impossible to love him. The date of this letter
is Feb. 28, 1751, more than three years after Johnson had for the last
time waited in Chesterfield's outward rooms. Moreover the same man is
described in three other letters (Sept. 22, 1749; Nov. 1749; and May 27,
1753), and described as one with whom Chesterfield lived on terms of
intimacy. In the two former of these letters he is called Mr. L.
Lyttelton did not become Sir George Lyttelton till Sept. 14, 1751. He
was raised to the peerage in 1757. Horace Walpole (_Reign of George
III_, i. 256) says of him:--'His ignorance of mankind, want of judgment,
with strange absence and awkwardness, involved him in mistakes and
ridicule.' Had Chesterfield's letter been published when it was written,
no one in all likelihood would have so much as dreamt that Johnson was
aimed at. But it did not come before the world till twenty-three years
later, when Johnson's quarrel with Chesterfield was known to every one,
when Johnson himself was at the very head of the literary world, and
when his peculiarities had become a matter of general interest.

[785] About four years after this time Gibbon, on his return to England,
became intimate with Mr. and Mrs. Mallet. He thus wrote of them:--'The
most useful friends of my father were the Mallets; they received me with
civility and kindness at first on his account, and afterwards on my own;
and (if I may use Lord Chesterfield's words) I was soon _domesticated_
in their house. Mr. Mallet, a name among the English poets, is praised
by an unforgiving enemy for the ease and elegance of his conversation,
and his wife was not destitute of wit or learning.' Gibbon's _Misc.
Works_, i 115. The 'unforgiving enemy' was Johnson, who wrote (_Works_,
viii. 468):--'His conversation was elegant and easy. The rest of his
character may, without injury to his memory, sink into silence.' Johnson
once said:--'I have seldom met with a man whose colloquial ability
exceeded that of Mallet.' Johnson's _Works_, 1787, xi. 214. See _post_,
March 27, 1772, and April 28, 1783; and Boswell's _Hebrides_, Sept.
10, 1773.

[786] Johnson had never read Bolingbroke's _Philosophy_. 'I have never
read Bolingbroke's impiety,' he said (_post_, under March 1, 1758). In
the memorable sentence that he, notwithstanding, pronounced upon the
author, he exposed himself to the retort which he had recorded in his
_Life of Boerhaave_ (_Works_, vi. 277). 'As Boerhaave was sitting in a
common boat, there arose a conversation among the passengers upon the
impious and pernicious doctrine of Spinosa, which, as they all agreed,
tends to the utter overthrow of all religion. Boerhaave sat and attended
silently to this discourse for some time, till one of the company ...
instead of confuting the positions of Spinosa by argument began to give
a loose to contumelious language and virulent invectives, which
Boerhaave was so little pleased with, that at last he could not forbear
asking him, whether he had ever read the author he declaimed against.'

[787] Lord Shelburne said that 'Bolingbroke was both a political and
personal coward.' Fitzmaurice's _Shelburne_, i. 29.

[788] It was in the summer of this year that Murphy became acquainted
with Johnson. (See _post,_ 1760.) 'The first striking sentence that he
heard from him was in a few days after the publication of Lord
Bolingbroke's posthumous works. Mr. Garrick asked him, "if he had seen
them." "Yes, I have seen them." "What do you think of them?" "Think of
them!" He made a long pause, and then replied: "Think of them! a
scoundrel and a coward! A scoundrel who spent his life in charging a gun
against Christianity; and a coward, who was afraid of hearing the report
of his own gun; but left half-a-crown to a hungry Scotchman to draw the
trigger after his death!" His mind, at this time strained and over
laboured by constant exertion, called for an interval of repose and
indolence. But indolence was the time of danger; it was then that his
spirits, not employed abroad, turned with inward hostility against
himself.' Murphy's _Johnson_, p. 79, and Piozzi's _Anec_., p. 235. Adam
Smith, perhaps, had this saying of Johnson's in mind, when in 1776 he
refused the request of the dying Hume to edit after his death his
_Dialogues on Natural Religion_. Hume wrote back:--'I think your
scruples groundless. Was Mallet anywise hurt by his publication of Lord
Bolingbroke? He received an office afterwards from the present King and
Lord Bute, the most prudish man in the world.' Smith did not yield. J.
H. Burton's _Hume_, ii. 491.

[789] According to Horace Walpole (_Letters_, ii. 374), Pelham died of a
surfeit. As Johnson says (_Works_, viii. 310):--'The death of great men
is not always proportioned to the lustre of their lives. The death of
Pope was imputed by some of his friends to a silver saucepan, in which
it was his delight to heat potted lampreys.' Fielding in _The Voyage to
Lisbon_ (_Works_, x. 201) records:--'I was at the worst on that
memorable day when the public lost Mr. Pelham. From that day I began
slowly, as it were, to draw my feet out of the grave.' '"I shall now
have no more peace," the King said with a sigh; being told of his
Minister's death.' Walpole's _George II_, i. 378.

[790] 'Thomas Warton, the younger brother of Dr. Warton, was a fellow of
Trinity College, Oxford. He was Poetry Professor from 1758 to 1768.
Mant's _Warton_, i. xliv. In 1785 he was made Poet Laureate. _Ib_.
lxxxiii. Mr. Mant, telling of an estrangement between Johnson and the
Wartons, says that he had heard 'on unquestionable authority that
Johnson had lamented, with tears in his eyes, that the Wartons had not
called on him for the last four years; and that he has been known to
declare that Tom Warton was the only man of genius whom he knew without
a heart.' _Ib_. xxxix.

[791] 'Observations on Spenser's Fairy Queen, the first edition of which
was now just published.' WARTON.

[792] 'Hughes published an edition of Spenser.' WARTON. See Johnson's
_Works_, vii.476.

[793] 'His Dictionary.' WARTON.

[794] 'He came to Oxford within a fortnight, and stayed about five
weeks. He lodged at a house called Kettel hall, near Trinity College.
But during this visit at Oxford, he collected nothing in the libraries
for his Dictionary.' WARTON.

[795] Pitt this year described, in the House of Commons, a visit that he
had paid to Oxford the summer before. He and his friends 'were at the
window of the Angel Inn; a lady was desired to sing _God save great
George our King_. The chorus was re-echoed by a set of young lads
drinking at a college over the way [Queen's], but with additions of rank
treason.' Walpole's _George II_, i. 413.

[796] A Fellow of Pembroke College, of Johnson's time, described the
college servants as in 'the state of servitude the most miserable that
can be conceived amongst so many masters.' He says that 'the kicks and
cuffs and bruises they submit to entitle them, when those who were
displeased relent,' to the compensation that is afforded by draughts of
ale. 'There is not a college servant, but if he have learnt to suffer,
and to be officious, and be inclined to tipple, may forget his cares in
a gallon or two of ale every day of his life.' _Dr. Johnson:--His
Friends, &c_., p. 45.

[797] It was against the Butler that Johnson, in his college days, had
written an epigram:--

'Quid mirum Maro quod digne
        canit arma virumque,
    Quid quod putidulum nostra
        Camoena sonat?
Limosum nobis Promus dat callidus
        haustum;
    Virgilio vires uva Falerna dedit.
Carmina vis nostri scribant
        meliora Poetae?
    Ingenium jubeas purior haustus
        alat.'

[798] Pope, _Eloisa to Abelard_, 1. 38.

[799] Johnson or Warton misquoted the line. It stands:--'Mittit
aromaticas vallis Saronica nubes.' Husbands's _Miscellany_, p. 112.

[800] De Quincey (_Works_, xiii. 162), after saying that Johnson did not
understand Latin 'with the elaborate and circumstantial accuracy
required for the editing critically of a Latin classic,'
continues:--'But if he had less than that, he also had more: he
_possessed_ that language in a way that no extent of mere critical
knowledge could confer. He wrote it genially, not as one translating
into it painfully from English, but as one using it for his original
organ of thinking. And in Latin verse he expressed himself at times with
the energy and freedom of a Roman.'

[801] Mr. Jorden. See _ante_, p. 59.

[802] Boswell (_Hebrides_, Aug. 19, 1773) says that Johnson looked at
the ruins at St. Andrew's 'with a strong indignation. I happened to ask
where John Knox was buried. Dr. Johnson burst out, "I hope in the
highway, I have been looking at his reformations."'

[803] In Reasmus Philipps's _Diary_ it is recorded that in Pembroke
College early in every November 'was kept a great Gaudy [feast], when
the Master dined in public, and the juniors (by an ancient custom they
were obliged to observe) went round the fire in the hall.' _Notes &
Queries_, 2nd S. x. 443.

[804] Communicated by the Reverend Mr. Thomas Warton, who had the
original. BOSWELL. In the imaginary college which was to be opened by
_The Club_ at St. Andrew's, Chambers was to be the professor of the law
of England. See Boswell's _Hebrides_, Aug. 25, 1773; also _post_, July
5, 1773 and March 30, 1774.

[805] I presume she was a relation of Mr. Zachariah Williams, who died
in his eighty-third year, July 12, 1755. When Dr. Johnson was with me at
Oxford, in 1755, he gave to the Bodleian Library a thin quarto of
twenty-one pages, a work in Italian, with an English translation on the
opposite page. The English titlepage is this: 'An Account of an Attempt
to ascertain the Longitude at Sea, by an exact Variation of the
Magnetical Needle, &c. By Zachariah Williams. London, printed for
Dodsley, 1755.' The English translation, from the strongest internal
marks, is unquestionably the work of Johnson. In a blank leaf, Johnson
has written the age, and time of death, of the authour Z. Williams, as I
have said above. On another blank leaf, is pasted a paragraph from a
newspaper, of the death and character of Williams, which is plainly
written by Johnson. He was very anxious about placing this book in the
Bodleian: and, for fear of any omission or mistake, he entered, in the
great Catalogue, the title-page of it with his own hand.'
WARTON.--BOSWELL.

In this statement there is a slight mistake. The English account, which
was written by Johnson, was the _original_ the Italian was a
_translation_, done by Baretti. See _post_, end of 1755. MALONE. Johnson
has twice entered in his own hand that 'Zachariah Williams, died July
12, 1755, in his eighty-third year,' and also on the title-page that
he was 82.

[806] See _ante_, p. 133.

[807] The compliment was, as it were, a mutual one. Mr. Wise urged
Thomas Warton to get the degree conferred before the _Dictionary_ was
published. 'It is in truth,' he wrote, 'doing ourselves more honour than
him, to have such a work done by an Oxford hand, and so able a one too,
and will show that we have not lost all regard for good letters, as has
been too often imputed to us by our enemies.' Wooll's _Warton_, p. 228.

[808] 'In procuring him the degree of Master of Arts by diploma at
Oxford.' WARTON.--BOSWELL.

[809] 'Lately fellow of Trinity College, and at this time Radclivian
librarian, at Oxford. He was a man of very considerable learning, and
eminently skilled in Roman and Anglo-Saxon antiquities. He died in
1767.' WARTON.--BOSWELL.

[810] No doubt _The Rambler_.

[811] 'Collins (the poet) was at this time at Oxford, on a visit to Mr.
Warton; but labouring under the most deplorable languor of body, and
dejection of mind.' WARTON. BOSWELL. Johnson, writing to Dr. Warton on
March 8, 1754, thus speaks of Collins:-'I knew him a few years ago full
of hopes, and full of projects, versed in many languages, high in fancy,
and strong in retention. This busy and forcible mind is now under the
government of those who lately would not have been able to comprehend
the least and most narrow of its designs.' Wooll's _Warton_ 1. 219.
Again, on Dec. 24, 1754:--'Poor dear Collins! Let me know whether you
think it would give him pleasure if I should write to him. I have often
been near his state, and therefore have it in great commiseration.'
_Ib_. p. 229. Again, on April 15, 1756:--'That man is no common loss.
The moralists all talk of the uncertainty of fortune, and the
transitoriness of beauty: but it is yet more dreadful to consider that
the powers of the mind are equally liable to change, that understanding
may make its appearance and depart, that it may blaze and expire.' _Ib_.
p. 239. See _post_, beginning of 1763.

[812] 'Of publishing a volume of observations on the best of Spenser's
works. It was hindered by my taking pupils in this College.'

WARTON.--BOSWELL. See Boswell's _Hebrides_, Aug. 28, 1773.

[814] 'His Dictionary.' WARTON.--BOSWELL.

[815] Johnson says (_Works_, viii. 403) that when Collins began to feel
the approaches of his dreadful malady 'with the usual weakness of men so
diseased he eagerly snatched that temporary relief with which the table
and the bottle flatter and seduce.'

[816] 'Petrarch, finding nothing in the word _eclogue_ of rural meaning,
supposed it to be corrupted by the copiers, and therefore called his own
pastorals aeglogues, by which he meant to express the talk of goatherds,
though it will mean only the talk of goats. This new name was adopted by
subsequent writers.' Johnson's _Works_, viii. 390.

[817] 'Of the degree at Oxford.' WARTON.--BOSWELL.

[818] This verse is from the long-lost _Bellerophon_, a tragedy by
Euripides. It is preserved by Suidas. CHARLES BURNEY. 'Alas! but

[824] 'Of the degree.' WARTON.--BOSWELL.

[825] 'Principal of St. Mary Hall at Oxford. He brought with him the
diploma from Oxford.' WARTON.--BOSWELL. Dr. King (_Anec_. p. 196) says
that he was one of the Jacobites who were presented to the Pretender
when, in September 1750, he paid a stealthy visit to England. The
Pretender in 1783 told Sir Horace Mann that he was in London in that
very month and year and had met fifty of his friends, among whom was the
Earl of Westmoreland, the future Chancellor of the University of Oxford.
Mahon's _England_, iv. II. Hume places the visit in 1753. Burton's
_Hume_, ii. 462. See also in Boswell's _Hebrides_, the account of the
Young Pretender. In 1754, writes Lord Shelburne, 'Dr. King in his speech
upon opening the Radcliffe Library at Oxford, before a full theatre
introduced three times the word _Redeat_, pausing each time for a
considerable space, during which the most unbounded applause shook the
theatre, which was filled with a vast body of peers, members of
parliament, and men of property. Soon after the rebellion [of 1745],
speaking of the Duke of Cumberland, he described him as a man, _qui
timet omnia prater Deum_. I presented this same Dr. King to George III.
in 1760.' Fitzmaurice's _Shelburne_, i. 35.

[826] 'I suppose Johnson means that my _kind intention_ of being the
_first_ to give him the good news of the degree being granted was
_frustrated_, because Dr. King brought it before my intelligence
arrived.' WARTON.--BOSWELL.

[827] Dr. Huddesford, President of Trinity College.' WARTON.--BOSWELL.

[828] Extracted from the Convocation-Register, Oxford. BOSWELL.

[829] The Earl of Arran, 'the last male of the illustrious House of
Ormond,' was the third Chancellor in succession that that family had
given to the University. The first of the three, the famous Duke of
Ormond, had, on his death in 1688, been succeeded by his grandson, the
young Duke. (Macaulay's _England_, iii. 159). He, on his impeachment and
flight from England in 1715, was succeeded by his brother, the Earl of
Arran. Richardson, writing in 1754 (_Carres_. ii. 198), said of the
University, 'Forty years ago it chose a Chancellor in despite of the
present reigning family, whose whole merit was that he was the brother
of a perjured, yet weak, rebel.' On Arran's death in 1758, the Earl of
Westmoreland, 'old dull Westmoreland' as Walpole calls him (_Letters_,
i. 290), was elected. It was at his installation that Johnson clapped
his hands till they were sore at Dr. King's speech (_post_, 1759). 'I
hear,' wrote Walpole of what he calls _the coronation at Oxford_, 'my
Lord Westmoreland's own retinue was all be-James'd with true-blue
ribands.' _Letters_, iii. 237. It is remarkable that this nobleman, who
in early life was a Whig, had commanded 'the body of troops which George
I. had been obliged to send to Oxford, to teach the University the only
kind of passive obedience which they did not approve.' Walpole's _George
II_, iii. 167.

[830] The original is in my possession, BOSWELL.

[831] We may conceive what a high gratification it must have been to
Johnson to receive his diploma from the hands of the great Dr. KING,
whose principles were so congenial with his own. BOSWELL.

[832] Johnson here alludes, I believe, to the charge of disloyalty
brought against the University at the time of the famous contested
election for Oxfordshire in 1754. A copy of treasonable verses was
found, it was said, near the market-place in Oxford, and the grand jury
made a presentment thereon. 'We must add,' they concluded, 'that it is
the highest aggravation of this crime to have a libel of a nature so
false and scandalous, published in a famous University, &c. _Gent. Mag_.
xxiv. 339. A reward of £200 was offered in the _London Gazette_ for the
detection of the writer or publisher,' _Ib_. p. 377.

[833] A single letter was a single piece of paper; a second piece of
paper, however small, or any inclosure constituted a double letter; it
was not the habit to prepay the postage. The charge for a single letter
to Oxford at this time was three-pence, which was gradually increased
till in 1812 it was eight-pence. _Penny Cyclo_. xviii. 455.

[834] 'The words in Italicks are allusions to passages in Mr. Warton's
poem, called _The Progress of Discontent_, now lately published.'

[838] Maty, as Prof. de Morgan pointed out, had in the autumn of 1755
been guilty of 'wilful suppression of the circumstances of Johnson's
attack on Lord Chesterfield.' In an article in his _Journal_ he regrets
the absence from the _Dictionary_ of the _Plan_. 'Elle eût épargné à
l'auteur la composition d'une nouvelle préface, qui ne contient qu'en
partie les mêmes choses, et qu'on est tenté de regarder comme destinée à
faire perdre de vue quelques-unes des obligations que M. Johnson avait
contractées, et le Mécène qu'il avait choisi.' _Notes and Queries_, 2nd

[840] See _ante_, p. 183, note 2.

[841] Sir John Hawkins, p. 341, inserts two notes as having passed
formally between Andrew Millar and Johnson, to the above effect. I am
assured this was not the case. In the way of incidental remark it was a
pleasant play of raillery. To have deliberately written notes in such
terms would have been morose. BOSWELL.

[842] 'Talking one day of the patronage the great sometimes affect to
give to literature and literary men, "Andrew Millar," says Johnson, "is
the Maecenas of the age."' Johnson's _Works_ (1787), xi. 200. Horace
Walpole, writing on May 18, 1749 (_Letters_ ii. 163), says:--'Millar the
bookseller has done very generously by Fielding; finding _Tom Jones_,
for which he had given him six hundred pounds, sell so greatly, he has
since given him another hundred.' Hume writing on July 6, 1759,
says:--'Poor Andrew Millar is declared bankrupt; his debts amount to
above £40,000, and it is said his creditors will not get above three
shillings in the pound. All the world allows him to have been diligent
and industrious; but his misfortunes are ascribed to the extravagance of
his wife, a very ordinary case in this city.' J. H. Burton's _Hume_, ii.
64. He must soon have recovered his position, for Dr. A. Carlyle (Auto.
p. 434) met Millar at Harrogate in 1763. In the inn were several
baronets, and great squires, members of parliament, who paid Millar
civility for the use of his two newspapers which came to him by every
post. 'Yet when he appeared in the morning, in his well-worn suit of
clothes, they could not help calling him Peter Pamphlet; for the
generous patron of Scotch authors, with his city wife and her niece,
were sufficiently ridiculous when they came into good company.' Mr.
Croker (_Boswell_, p. 630) says that Millar was the bookseller described
by Johnson, _post_, April 24, 1779. as 'habitually and equably drunk.'
He is, I think, mistaken.

[845] Kettel Hall is an ancient tenement built about the year 1615 by
Dr. Ralph Kettel, President of Trinity College, for the accommodation of
commoners of that Society. It adjoins the College; and was a few years
ago converted into a private house. MALONE.

'June 12, Mr. Paul Knapton, bookseller. June 18, Thos. Longman, Esq.,

even so early as 1755 the Longmans ranked higher than most of
their brethren.

[851] In the _Plan of an English Dictionary_ (_ib_. p. 16) Johnson,
writing of 'the word _perfection_' says:--'Though in its philosophical
and exact sense it can be of little use among human beings, it is often
so much degraded from its original signification, that the academicians
have inserted in their work, _the perfection of a language_, and, with a
little more licentiousness, might have prevailed on themselves to have
added _the perfection of a Dictionary_.' In the Preface to the fourth
edition he writes:--'He that undertakes to compile a Dictionary
undertakes that, which if it comprehends the full extent of his design,
he knows himself unable to perform.' _Ib_. p. 52.

[852] _Ib_. p. 51.

[855] He defines both _towards the wind_. The definitions remain
unchanged in the fourth edition, the last corrected by Johnson, and also
in the third edition of the abridgment, though this abridgment was made
by him. _Pastern_ also remains unaltered in this latter edition. In the
fourth edition he corrected it. 'The drawback of his character,' wrote
Sir Joshua Reynolds, 'is entertaining prejudices on very slight
foundations; giving an opinion, perhaps, first at random, but from its
being contradicted he thinks himself obliged always to support it, or,
if he cannot support, still not to acquiesce. Of this I remember an
instance of a defect or forgetfulness in his _Dictionary_. I asked him
how he came not to correct it in the second edition. "No," says he,
"they made so much of it that I would not flatter them by altering it."'
Taylor's _Reynolds_, ii. 461.

[856] In his Preface (_Works_, v. 50) he anticipated errors and
laughter. 'A few wild blunders and risible absurdities, from which no
work of such multiplicity was ever free, may for a time furnish folly
with laughter and harden ignorance into contempt' In a letter written
nearly thirty years later he said:--'Dictionaries are like watches, the
worst is better than none, and the best cannot be expected to go quite
true.' _Piozzi Letters_, ii. 406.

[857] See _post_, under July 20, 1762.

[858] 'Network. Anything reticulated or decussated, at equal distances,
with interstices between the intersections.' Reticulated is defined
'Made of network; formed with interstitial vacuities.'

[859] 'That part of my work on which I expect malignity most frequently
to fasten is the _Explanation_.... Such is the fate of hapless
lexicography, that not only darkness, but light, impedes and distresses
it; things may be not only too little, but too much known, to be happily
illustrated.' Johnson's _Works_, v. 34.

[860] In the original, 'to admit _a_ definition.' _Ib_.

[861] In the original, '_drier.' Ib_. 38.

[862] 'Tory. (A cant term derived, I suppose, from an Irish word
signifying a savage.) One who adheres to the ancient constitution of the
state, and the apostolical hierarchy of the Church of England: opposed
to a _whig_.'

[863] 'Whig. The name of a faction.' Lord Marchmont (_post_, May 12,
1778) said that 'Johnson was the first that brought Whig and Tory into a
dictionary.' In this he was mistaken. In the fourth edition of Dr. Adam
Littleton's _Linguae Latinae Liber Dictionarius_, published in 1703,
_Whig_ is translated _Homo fanaticus, factiosus; Whiggism, Enthusiasmus,
Perduellio; Tory, bog-trotter or Irish robber, Praedo Hibernicus; Tory_
opposed to whig, _Regiarum partium assertor_. These definitions are not
in the first edition, published in 1678. _A pensioner_ or _bride_
[bribed] _person_ is rendered _Mercenarius.

[864] 'Pension. An allowance made to any one without an equivalent. In
England it is generally understood to mean pay given to a state hireling
for treason to his country.' _Pensioner_ is defined as 'One who is
supported by an allowance paid at the will of another; a dependant.'
These definitions remain in the fourth edition, corrected by Johnson
in 1773.

[865] 'Oats. A grain which in England is generally given to horses, but
in Scotland supports the people.' See _post_, March 23, 1776, and March
21, 1783. 'Did you ever hear,' wrote Sir Walter Scott, 'of Lord
Elibank's reply when Johnson's famous definition of oats was pointed out
first to him. "Very true, and where will you find such _men_ and such
_horses_?"' Croker's _Carres_, ii. 35.

[866] He thus defines Excise: 'A hateful tax levied upon commodities,
and adjudged not by the common judges of property, but wretches hired by
those to whom Excise is paid.' The Commissioners of Excise being
offended by this severe reflection, consulted Mr. Murray, then Attorney
General, to know whether redress could be legally obtained. I wished to
have procured for my readers a copy of the opinion which he gave, and
which may now be justly considered as history; but the mysterious
secrecy of office, it seems, would not permit it. I am, however,
informed, by very good authority, that its import was, that the passage
might be considered as actionable; but that it would be more prudent in
the board not to prosecute. Johnson never made the smallest alteration
in this passage. We find he still retained his early prejudice against
Excise; for in _The Idler_, No. 65, there is the following very
extraordinary paragraph: 'The authenticity of _Clarendon's_ history,
though printed with the sanction of one of the first Universities of the
world, had not an unexpected manuscript been happily discovered, would,
with the help of factious credulity, have been brought into question by
the two lowest of all human beings, a Scribbler for a party, and a
Commissioner of Excise.'--The persons to whom he alludes were Mr. John
Oldmixon, and George Ducket, Esq. BOSWELL. Mr. Croker obtained a copy
of the case.

'_Case for the opinion of Mr. Attorney-General_.

'Mr. Samuel Johnson has lately published "A Dictionary of the English
Language," in which are the following words:--

'"EXCISE, _n.s_. A hateful tax levied upon commodities and adjudged not
by the common judges of property, but by wretches hired by those to whom
excise is paid."

'_The author's definition being observed by the Commissioners of Excise,
they desire the favour of your opinion_. "Qu. Whether it will not be
considered as a libel, and if so, whether it is not proper to proceed
against the author, printers, and publishers thereof, or any and which
of them, by information, or how otherwise?"

'I am of opinion that it is a libel. But under all the circumstances, I
should think it better to give him an opportunity of altering his
definition; and, in case he do not, to threaten him with an information.

'29th Nov. 1755. W. Murray.' In one of the Parl. Debates of 1742 Johnson
makes Pitt say that 'it is probable that we shall detect bribery
descending through a long subordination of wretches combined against the
public happiness, from the prime minister surrounded by peers and
officers of state to the exciseman dictating politics amidst a company
of mechanics whom he debauches at the public expense, and lists in the
service of his master with the taxes which he gathers.' _Parl. Hist_.,
xii. _570_. See _ante_, p. 36, note 5.

[867] He defined _Favourite_ as 'One chosen as a companion by a
superiour; a mean wretch, whose whole business is by any means to
please:' and _Revolution_ as 'change in the state of a government or
country. It is used among us _kat hexochaen_ for the change produced by
the admission of King William and Queen Mary.' For these definitions
Wilkes attacked him in _The North Briton_, No. xii. In the fourth
edition Johnson gives a second definition of _patriot_:--'It is
sometimes used for a factious disturber of the government.' Premier and
_prime minister_ are not defined. _Post_, April 14, 1775. See also
_ante_, p. 264 note, for the definition of _patron_; and _post_, April
28, 1783 for that of _alias_.

[868] 'There have been great contests in the Privy Council about the
trial of the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford [on a charge of Jacobitism]: Lord
Gower pressed it extremely. He asked the Attorney-General his opinion,
who told him the evidence did not appear strong enough. Lord Gower
said:--"Mr. Attorney, you seem to be very lukewarm for your party." He
replied:--"My Lord, I never was lukewarm for my party, _nor ever was but
of one party_!"' Walpole's _Letters_, ii. 140. Mr. Croker assumes that
Johnson here 'attempted a pun, and wrote the name (as pronounced) Go'er.
Johnson was very little likely to pun, for 'he had a great contempt for
that species of wit.' _Post_, April 30, 1773.

[869] Boswell omits the salutation which follows this definition:

Chair Ithakae met haethla, met halgea pikra Haspasios teon oudas
ikanomai.

'Dr. Johnson,' says Miss Burney, 'inquired if I had ever yet visited
_Grub-street_, but was obliged to restrain his anger when I answered
"No;" because he had never paid his respects to it himself. "However,"
says he, "you and I, Burney, will go together; we have a very good right
to go, so we'll visit the mansions of our progenitors, and take up our
own freedom together."' Mme. D'Arblay's _Diary_, i. 415.

[870] Lord Bolingbroke had said (_Works_, in. 317): 'I approve the
devotion of a studious man at Christ Church, who was overheard in his
oratory entering into a detail with God, and acknowledging the divine
goodness in furnishing the world with makers of dictionaries. These men
court fame, as well as their betters, by such means as God has given
them to acquire it. They deserve encouragement while they continue to
compile, and neither affect wit, nor presume to reason.' Johnson himself
in _The Adventurer_, No. 39, had in 1753 described a class of men who
'employed their minds in such operations as required neither celerity
nor strength, in the low drudgery of collating copies, comparing
authorities, digesting dictionaries,' &c. Lord Monboddo, in his _Origin
of Language_, v. 273, says that 'J. C. Scaliger called the makers of
dictionaries _les portefaix de la république des lettres_.'

[871] Great though his depression was, yet he could say with truth in
his Preface:--'Despondency has never so far prevailed as to depress me
to negligence.' _Works_, v. 43.

[872] _Ib_. p. 51. 'In the preface the author described the difficulties
with which he had been left to struggle so forcibly and pathetically
that the ablest and most malevolent of all the enemies of his fame,
Horne Tooke, never could read that passage without tears.' Macaulay's
_Misc. Writings_, p. 382. It is in _A Letter to John Dunning, Esq_. (p.
56) that Horne Tooke, or rather Horne, wrote:--'I could never read his
preface without shedding a tear.' See _post_, May 13, 1778. On Oct. 10,
1779, Boswell told Johnson, that he had been 'agreeably mistaken' in
saying:--'What would it avail me in this gloom of solitude?'

[873] It appears even by many a passage in the Preface--one of the
proudest pieces of writing in our language. 'The chief glory,' he
writes, 'of every people arises from its authors: whether I shall add
anything by my own writings to the reputation of English literature must
be left to time.' 'I deliver,' he says, 'my book to the world with the
spirit of a man that has endeavoured well.... In this work, when it
shall be found that much is omitted, let it not be forgotten that much
likewise is performed; and though no book was ever spared out of
tenderness to the author, and the world is little solicitous to know
whence proceeded the faults of that which it condemns; yet it may
gratify curiosity to inform it, that the _English Dictionary_ was
written with little assistance of the learned, and without any patronage
of the great; not in the soft obscurities of retirement, or under the
shelter of academick bowers, but amidst inconvenience and distraction,
in sickness and in sorrow.' _Works_, v. pp. 49-51. Thomas Warton wrote
to his brother:--'I fear his preface will disgust by the expressions of
his consciousness of superiority, and of his contempt of patronage.'
Wooll's _Warton_, p. 231.

[874] That praise was slow in coming is shown by his letter to Mr.
Burney, written two years and eight months after the publication of the
_Dictionary_. 'Your praise,' he wrote, 'was welcome, not only because I
believe it was sincere, but because praise has been very scarce....
Yours is the only letter of good-will that I have received; though,
indeed, I am promised something of that sort from Sweden.' _Post_,
Dec. 24, 1757.

[875] In the _Edinburgh Review_ (No. 1, 1755)--a periodical which only
lasted two years--there is a review by Adam Smith of Johnson's
_Dictionary_. Smith admits the 'very extraordinary merit' of the author.
'The plan,' however, 'is not sufficiently grammatical.' To explain what
he intends, he inserts 'an article or two from Mr. Johnson, and opposes
to them the same articles, digested in the manner which we would have
wished him to have followed.' He takes the words _but_ and _humour_. One
part of his definition of humour is curious--'something which comes upon
a man by fits, which he can neither command nor restrain, and which is
not perfectly consistent with true politeness.' This essay has not, I
believe, been reprinted.

[876] She died in March 1752; the _Dictionary_ was published in April
1755.

[877] In the Preface he writes (_Works_, v. 49):--'Much of my life has
been lost under the pressures of disease; much has been trifled away;
and much has always been spent in provision for the day that was passing
over me.' In his fine Latin poem [Greek: Inothi seauton] 'he has left,'
says Mr. Murphy (_Life_, p. 82), 'a picture of himself drawn with as
much truth, and as firm a hand, as can be seen in the portraits of
Hogarth or Sir Joshua Reynolds.' He wrote it after revising and
enlarging his _Dictionary_, and he sadly asks himself what is left for
him to do.

Me, pensi immunis cum jam mihi reddor, inertis
Desidiae sors dura manet, graviorque labore
Tristis et atra quies, et tardae taedia vitae.
Nascuntur curis curae, vexatque dolorum
Importuna cohors, vacuae mala somnia mentis.
Nunc clamosa juvant nocturnae gaudia mensae,
Nunc loca sola placent; frustra te, somne, recumbens,
Alme voco, impatiens noctis, metuensque diei.
Omnia percurro trepidus, circum omnia lustro,
Si qua usquam pateat melioris semita vitae,
Nec quid agam invenio....
Quid faciam? tenebrisne pigram damnare senectam
Restat? an accingar studiis gravioribus audax?
Aut, hoc si nimium est, tandem nova lexica poscam?

Johnson's _Works_, i. 164.

[878] A few weeks before his wife's death he wrote in _The Rambler_ (No.
196):--'The miseries of life would be increased beyond all human power
of endurance, if we were to enter the world with the same opinions as we
carry from it.' He would, I think, scarcely have expressed himself so
strongly towards his end. Though, as Dr. Maxwell records, in his
_Collectanea_ (_post_, 1770), 'he often used to quote with great pathos
those fine lines of Virgil:--

'Optima quaeque dies miseris mortalibus aevi
  Prima fugit, &c.'

yet he owned, and the pages of Boswell amply testify, that it was in the
latter period of his life that he had his happiest days.

[879] _Macbeth_, Act ii. sc. 3.

[880] In the third edition, published in 1773, he left out the words
_perhaps never_, and added the following paragraph:--

'It sometimes begins middle or final syllables in words compounded, as
_block-head_, or derived from the Latin, as _compre-hended_.' BOSWELL.
In the _Abridgment_, which was published some years earlier, after
_never_ is added 'except in compounded words.'

[881] It was published in the _Gent. Mag_. for April, 1755 (xxv. 190),
just below the advertisement of the _Dictionary_.

[882] In the original, 'Milton and Shakespeare.'

[883] The number of the French Academy employed in settling their
language. BOSWELL.

[884] The maximum reward offered by a bill passed in 1714 was £20,000
for a method that determined the longitude at sea to half a degree of a
great circle, or thirty geographical miles. For less accuracy smaller
rewards were offered. _Ann. Reg_. viii. 114. In 1765 John Harrison
received £7,500 for his chronometer; he had previously been paid £2,500;
_ib_. 128. In this Act of Parliament 'the legislature never contemplated
the invention of a _method_, but only of the means of making existing
methods accurate.' _Penny Cyclo_. xiv. 139. An old sea-faring man wrote
to Swift that he had found out the longitude. The Dean replied 'that he
never knew but two projectors, one of whom ruined himself and his
family, and the other hanged himself; and desired him to desist lest one
or other might happen to him.' Swift's _Works_ (1803), xvii. 157. In
_She Stoops to Conquer_ (Act i. sc. 2), when Tony ends his directions to
the travellers by telling them,--'coming to the farmer's barn you are to
turn to the right, and then to the left, and then to the right about
again, till you find out the old mill;' Marlow exclaims: 'Zounds, man!
we could as soon find out the longitude.'

[885] Joseph Baretti, a native of Piedmont, came to England in 1750 (see
Preface to his _Account of Italy_, p. ix). He died in May, 1789. In his
_Journey from London to Genoa_ (ii. 276), he says that his father was
one of the two architects of the King of Sardinia. Shortly after his
death a writer in the _Gent. Mag_. (Iix. 469, 570), who was believed to
be Vincent, Dean of Westminster, thus wrote of him:--'Though his
severity had created him enemies, his talents, conversation, and
integrity had conciliated the regard of many valuable friends and
acquaintance. His manners were apparently rough, but not unsocial. His
integrity was in every period of his distresses constant and
unimpeached. His wants he never made known but in the last extremity. He
and Johnson had been friends in distress. One evening, when they had
agreed to go to the tavern, a foreigner in the streets, by a specious
tale of distress, emptied the Doctor's purse of the last half-guinea it
contained. When the reckoning came, what was his surprise upon his
recollecting that his purse was totally exhausted. Baretti had
fortunately enough to answer the demand, and has often declared that it
was impossible for him not to reverence a man, who could give away all
that he was worth, without recollecting his own distress.' See _post_,
Oct. 20, 1769.

[886] See note by Mr. Warton, _ante_, p. 275. BOSWELL.

[887] 'On Saturday the 12th, about twelve at night, died Mr. Zachariah
Williams, in his eighty-third year, after an illness of eight months, in
full possession of his mental faculties. He has been long known to
philosophers and seamen for his skill in magnetism, and his proposal to
ascertain the longitude by a peculiar system of the variation of the
compass. He was a man of industry indefatigable, of conversation
inoffensive, patient of adversity and disease, eminently sober,
temperate, and pious; and worthy to have ended life with better
fortune.' BOSWELL.

[888] Johnson's _Works_, v. 49. Malone, in a note on this passage,
says:--'Johnson appears to have been in this year in great pecuniary
distress, having been arrested for debt; on which occasion Richardson
became his surety.' He refers to the following letter in the _Richardson
Corres_, v. 285:--

'To MR. RICHARDSON.

'Tuesday, Feb. 19, 1756.

'DEAR SIR,

'I return you my sincerest thanks for the favour which you were pleased
to do me two nights ago. Be pleased to accept of this little book, which
is all that I have published this winter. The inflammation is come again
into my eye, so that I can write very little. I am, Sir, your most
obliged and most humble servant,

'SAM. JOHNSON.'

The 'little book' is not (as Mr. Croker suggests) Williams's
_Longitude_, for it was published in Jan. 1755 (_Gent. Mag_. xxv. 47);
but the _Abridgment of the Dictionary_, which was advertised in the
_Gent. Mag_. for Jan. 1756. Murphy says (_Life_, p. 86), that he has
before him a letter in Johnson's handwriting, which shows the distress
of the man who had written _The Rambler_, and finished the great work of
his _Dictionary_. It is directed to Mr. Richardson, and is as follows:--

'SIR,--I am obliged to entreat your assistance. I am now under an arrest
for five pounds eighteen shillings. Mr. Strahan, from whom I should have
received the necessary help in this case, is not at home, and I am
afraid of not finding Mr. Millar. If you will be so good as to send me
this sum, I will very gratefully repay you, and add it to all former
obligations. I am, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,

'SAMUEL JOHNSON.

 'Gough-Square,
  16 March.'

In the margin of this letter there is a memorandum in these
words:--'March 16, 1756. Sent six guineas. Witness, Win. Richardson.' In
the _European Mag_., vii. 54, there is the following anecdote recorded,
for which Steevens most likely was the authority:--'I remember writing
to Richardson' said Johnson, 'from a spunging-house; and was so sure of
my deliverance through his kindness and liberality, that before his
reply was brought I knew I could afford to joke with the rascal who had
me in custody, and did so over a pint of adulterated wine, for which at
that instant I had no money to pay.' It is very likely that this
anecdote has no other foundation than Johnson's second letter to
Richardson, which is dated, not from a spunging-house, but from his own
residence. What kind of fate awaited a man who was thrown into prison
for debt is shown by the following passage in Wesley's _Journal_ (ii.
267), dated Feb. 3, 1753:--'I visited one in the Marshalsea prison, a
nursery of all manner of wickedness. O shame to man, that there should
be such a place, such a picture of hell upon earth!' A few days later he
writes:--'I visited as many more as I could. I found some in their cells
under ground; others in their garrets, half starved both with cold and
hunger, added to weakness and pain.'

[889] In a Debate on the Copyright Bill on May 16, 1774, Governor
Johnstone said:--'It had been urged that Dr. Johnson had received an
after gratification from the booksellers who employed him to compile his
_Dictionary_. He had in his hand a letter from Dr. Johnson, which he
read, in which the doctor denied the assertion, but declared that his
employers fulfilled their bargain with him, and that he was satisfied.'
_Parl. Hist_. xvii. 1105.

[890] He more than once attacked them. Thus in _An Appeal to the
Public_, which he wrote for the _Gent. Mag_. in 1739 (_Works_, v. 348),
he said:--'Nothing is more criminal in the opinion of many of them, than
for an author to enjoy more advantage from his own works than they are
disposed to allow him. This is a principle so well established among
them, that we can produce some who threatened printers with their
highest displeasure, for having dared to print books for those that
wrote them.' In the _Life of Savage_ (_ib_. viii. 132), written in 1744,
he writes of the 'avarice, by which the booksellers are frequently
incited to oppress that genius by which they are supported.' In the
_Life of Dryden_ (_ib_. vii. 299), written in 1779, he speaks of an
improvement. 'The general conduct of traders was much less liberal in
those times than in our own; their views were narrower, and their
manners grosser. To the mercantile ruggedness of that race the delicacy
of the poet was sometimes exposed.'

[891] _Prayers and Meditations_, p. 40 [25]. BOSWELL. Johnson wrote to
Miss Boothby on Dec. 30, 1755:--'If I turn my thoughts upon myself, what
do I perceive but a poor helpless being, reduced by a blast of wind to
weakness and misery?... Mr. Fitzherbert sent to-day to offer me some
wine; the people about me say I ought to accept it. I shall therefore be
obliged to him if he will send me a bottle.' _Pioszi Letters_, ii. 393.

[892] _Prayers and Meditations_, p. 27. BOSWELL

[893] See _post_, April 6, 1775. Kit Smart, once a Fellow of Pembroke
Hall, Cambridge, ended his life in the King's Bench Prison; 'where he
had owed to a small subscription, of which Dr. Burney was at the head, a
miserable pittance beyond the prison allowance. In his latest letter to
Dr. Burney, he passionately pleaded for a fellow-sufferer, "whom I
myself," he impressively adds, "have already assisted according to my
willing poverty." In another letter to the same friend he said:--"I
bless God for your good nature, which please to take for a receipt."'
_Memoirs of Dr. Burney_, i. 205, 280.

[894] In this Essay Johnson writes (_Works_, v. 315):--'I think there is
room to question whether a great part of mankind has yet been informed
that life is sustained by the fruits of the earth. I was once, indeed,
provoked to ask a lady of great eminence for genius, "Whether she knew
of what bread is made."'

[895] In _The Universal Visiter_ this Essay is entitled, 'Reflections on
the Present State of Literature;' and in Johnson's _Works_, v. 355, 'A
Project for the Employment of Authors.' The whole world, he says, is
turning author. Their number is so large that employment must be found
for them. 'There are some reasons for which they may seem particularly
qualified for a military life. They are used to suffer want of every
kind; they are accustomed to obey the word of command from their patrons
and their booksellers; they have always passed a life of hazard and
adventure, uncertain what may be their state on the next day.... There
are some whom long depression under supercilious patrons has so humbled
and crushed, that they will never have steadiness to keep their ranks.
But for these men there may be found fifes and drums, and they will be
well enough pleased to inflame others to battle, if they are not obliged
to fight themselves.'

[896] He added it also to his _Life of Pope_.

[897] 'This employment,' wrote Murphy (_Life_, p. 88), 'engrossed but
little of Johnson's time. He resigned himself to indolence, took no
exercise, rose about two, and then received the visits of his friends.
Authors long since forgotten waited on him as their oracle, and he gave
responses in the chair of criticism. He listened to the complaints, the
schemes, and the hopes and fears of a crowd of inferior writers, "who,"
he said, in the words of Roger Ascham, "lived, men knew not how, and
died obscure, men marked not when." He believed, that he could give a
better history of Grub Street than any man living. His house was filled
with a succession of visitors till four or five in the evening. During
the whole time he presided at his tea-table.' In _The Rambler_, No. 145,
Johnson takes the part of these inferior writers:--'a race of beings
equally obscure and equally indigent, who, because their usefulness is
less obvious to vulgar apprehensions, live unrewarded and die unpitied,
and who have been long exposed to insult without a defender, and to
censure without an apologist.'

[898] In this essay (_Works_, vi. 129) Johnson describes Canada as a
'region of desolate sterility,' 'a cold, uncomfortable, uninviting
region, from which nothing but furs and fish were to be had.'

[899] The bill of 1756 that he considers passed through the Commons but
was rejected by the Lords. It is curious as showing the comparative
population of the different counties, Devonshire was to furnish 3200
men--twice as many as Lancashire. Essex, Kent, Norfolk and Suffolk were
each to furnish 1920 men; Lancashire, Surrey, Sussex, and Wiltshire
1600: Durham and Bedfordshire 800. From the three Ridings of Yorkshire
4800 were to be raised. The men were to be exercised every Sunday before
and after service. _The Literary Magazine_, p. 58.

[900] In this paper are found the forcible words, 'The desperate remedy
of desperate distress,' which have been used since by orators. _Ib_.
p. 121.

[901] Johnson considers here the war in America between the English and
French, and shows a strong feeling for the natives who had been wronged
by both nations. 'Such is the contest that no honest man can heartily
wish success to either party.... The American dispute between the French
and us is only the quarrel of two robbers for the spoils of a
passenger.' The French had this in their favour, that they had treated
the natives better than we. 'The favour of the Indians which they enjoy
with very few exceptions among all the nations of the northern continent
we ought to consider with other thoughts; this favour we might have
enjoyed, if we had been careful to deserve it.' _Works_, vi. 114, 122.

[902] These Memoirs end with the year 1745. Johnson had intended to
continue them, for he writes:--'We shall here suspend our narrative.'
_Ib_. vi. 474.

[903] See _ante_, p. 221.

[904] The sentence continues:--'and produce heirs to the father's
habiliments.' _Ib_. vi. 436. Another instance may be adduced of his
_Brownism_ in the following line:--'The war continued in an
equilibration by alternate losses and advantages.' _Ib_ 473.

[905] In a letter from the Secretary of the Tall Club in _The Guardian_,
No. 108. 'If the fair sex look upon us with an eye of favour, we shall
make some attempts to lengthen out the human figure, and restore it to
its ancient procerity.'

[906] See _post_, March 23, 1783.

[907] 'As power is the constant and unavoidable consequence of learning,
there is no reason to doubt that the time is approaching when the
Americans shall in their turn have some influence on the affairs of
mankind, for literature apparently gains ground among them. A library is
established in Carolina and some great electrical discoveries were made
at Philadelphia...The fear that the American colonies will break off
their dependence on England I have always thought chimerical and vain
... They must be dependent, and if they forsake us, or be forsaken by
us, must fall into the hands of France.' _Literary Magazine_, pp.
293, 299.

[908] Johnson, I have no doubt, wrote the _Review of A True Account of
Lisbon since the Earthquake_, in which it is stated that the destruction
was grossly exaggerated. After quoting the writer at length, he
concludes:--'Such then is the actual, real situation of _that place
which once was_ Lisbon, and has been since gazetically and
pamphletically quite destroyed, consumed, annihilated! Now, upon
comparing this simple narration of things and facts with the false and
absurd accounts which have rather insulted and imposed upon us than
informed us, who but must see the enormous disproportion?...
Exaggeration and the absurdities ever faithfully attached to it are
inseparable attitudes of the ignorant, the empty, and the affected.
Hence those eloquent tropes so familiar in every conversation,
_monstrously pretty, vastly little_; ... hence your _eminent shoe-maker,
farriers, and undertakers_.... It is to the same muddy source we owe the
many falsehoods and absurdities we have been pestered with concerning
Lisbon. Thence your extravagantly sublime figures: _Lisbon is no more;
can be seen no more_, etc., ... with all the other prodigal effusions of
bombast beyond that stretch of time or temper to enumerate. _Ib_. p. 22.

[912] In Ireland there was no act to limit the duration of parliament.
One parliament sat through the whole reign of George II--thirty-three
years. Dr. Lucas, a Dublin physician, in attacking other grievances,
attacked also this. In 1749 he would have been elected member for
Dublin, had he not, on a charge of seditious writings, been committed by
the House of Commons to prison. He was to be confined, he was told, 'in
the common hall of the prison among the felons.' He fled to England,
which was all that the government wanted, and he practised as a
physician in London. In 1761 he was restored to the liberties of the
City of Dublin and was also elected one of its members. Hardy's _Lord
Charlemont_, i. 249, 299; and _Gent. Mag_., xx. 58 and xxxi. 236.

[917] In the _Lives of the Poets (Works, viii. 383) Johnson writes:--'Dr
Watts was one of the first authors that taught the Dissenters to court
attention by the graces of language. Whatever they had among them
before, whether of learning or acuteness, was commonly obscured and
blunted by coarseness and inelegance of style. He showed them that zeal
and purity might be expressed and enforced by polished diction.'

[918] 'Such he [Dr. Watts] was as every Christian Church would rejoice
to have adopted.' _Ib_. p. 380. See also _post_, July 7, 1777, and

[920] Mr. Hanway would have had the support of Johnson's father, who, as
his son writes, 'considered tea as very expensive, and discouraged my
mother from keeping company with the neighbours, and from paying visits
or receiving them. She lived to say, many years after, that if the time
were to pass again, she would not comply with such unsocial
injunctions.' _Account of Johnson's Early Life_, p. 18. The Methodists,
ten years earlier than Hanway, had declared war on tea. 'After talking
largely with both the men and women Leaders,' writes Wesley, 'we agreed
it would prevent great expense, as well of health as of time and of
money, if the poorer people of our society could be persuaded to leave
off drinking of tea.' Wesley's _Journal_, i. 526. Pepys, writing in
1660, says: 'I did send for a cup of tee, (a China drink) of which I
never had drank before.' Pepys' _Diary_, i. 137. Horace Walpole
(_Letters_, i. 224) writing in 1743 says:--'They have talked of a new
duty on tea, to be paid by every housekeeper for all the persons in
their families; but it will scarce be proposed. Tea is so universal,
that it would make a greater clamour than a duty on wine.' In October
1734 tea was sold in London at the following prices:--Ordinary Bohca 9s.
per lb. Fine Bohca 10s. to 12s. per lb. Pekoe 15s. per lb. Hyson 20s. to
25s. per lb. _Gent. Mag_. iv. 575.

[921] Yet in his reply to Mr. Hanway he said (_Works_, vi. 33):--'I
allowed tea to be a barren superfluity, neither medicinal nor
nutritious, that neither supplied strength nor cheerfulness, neither
relieved weariness, nor exhilarated sorrow.' Cumberland writes
(_Memoirs_, i. 357):--'I remember when Sir Joshua Reynolds at my house
reminded Dr. Johnson that he had drank eleven cups, he replied: "Sir, I
did not count your glasses of wine, why should you number up my cups of
tea?" And then laughing in perfect good humour he added:--"Sir, I should
have released the lady from any further trouble, if it had not been for
your remark; but you have reminded me that I want one of the dozen, and
I must request Mrs. Cumberland to round up my number."'

[922] In this Review Johnson describes himself as 'a hardened and
shameless tea-drinker, who has for twenty years diluted his meals with
only the infusion of this fascinating plant; whose kettle has scarcely
time to cool; who with tea amuses the evening, with tea solaces the
midnight, and with tea welcomes the morning.' Johnson's _Works_, vi. 21.
That 'he never felt the least inconvenience from it' may well be
doubted. His nights were almost always bad. In 1774 he recorded:--'I
could not drink this day either coffee or tea after dinner. I know not
when I missed before.' The next day he recorded:--'Last night my sleep
was remarkably quiet. I know not whether by fatigue in walking, or by
forbearance of tea.' _Diary of a Journey into North Wales_, Aug. 4.

[925] In Hanway's _Essay_ Johnson found much to praisc. Hanway often
went to the root when he dealt with the evils of life. Thus he
writes:--'The introducing new habits of life is the most substantial
charity.' But he thus mingles sense and nonsense:--'Though tea and gin
have spread their baneful influence over this island and his Majesty's
other dominions, yet you may be well assured that the Governors of the
Foundling Hospital will exert their utmost skill and vigilance to
prevent the children under their care from being poisoned, or enervated,
by one or the other.' Johnson's _Works_, vi. 26, 28.

[926] 'Et pourquoi tuer cet amiral? C'est, lui dit-on, parce qu'il n'a
pas fait tuer assez de monde; il a livré un combat à un amiral français,
et on a trouvé qu'il n'était pas assez près de lui. Mais, dit Candide,
l'amiral français était aussi loin de l'amiral anglais que celui-ci
l'était de l'autre. Cela est incontestable, lui répliquat-on; mais dans
ce pays-ci il est bon de tuer de temps en temps un amiral pour
encourager les autres.' _Candide_, ch. xxiii.

[931] See _ante_, p. 223.

[932] Some time after Dr. Johnson's death there appeared in the
newspapers and magazines an illiberal and petulant attack upon him, in
the form of an Epitaph, under the name of Mr. Soame Jenyns, very
unworthy of that gentleman, who had quietly submitted to the critical
lash while Johnson lived. It assumed, as characteristicks of him, all
the vulgar circumstances of abuse which had circulated amongst the
ignorant. It was an unbecoming indulgence of puny resentment, at a time
when he himself was at a very advanced age, and had a near prospect of
descending to the grave. I was truly sorry for it; for he was then
become an avowed, and (as my Lord Bishop of London, who had a serious
conversation with him on the subject, assures me) a sincere Christian.
He could not expect that Johnson's numerous friends would patiently bear
to have the memory of their master stigmatized by no mean pen, but that,
at least, one would be found to retort. Accordingly, this unjust and
sarcastick Epitaph was met in the same publick field by an answer, in
terms by no means soft, and such as wanton provocation only
could justify:

'EPITAPH,

'_Prepared for a creature_ not quite dead _yet_.

'Here lies a little ugly nauseous elf,
Who judging only from its wretched self,
Feebly attempted, petulant and vain,
The "Origin of Evil" to explain.
A mighty Genius at this elf displeas'd,
With a strong critick grasp the urchin squeez'd.
For thirty years its coward spleen it kept,
Till in the duat the mighty Genius slept;
Then stunk and fretted in expiring snuff,
And blink'd at JOHNSON with its last poor puff.'

that great and excellent prelate and patriot, the Most Reverend Dr. Hugh
Boulter; Late Lord-Archbishop of Ardmagh, and Primate of All Ireland_.
Dublin, 1745. Such lines as the following might well have been blotted,
but of them the poem is chiefly formed:--

'My peaceful song in lays instructive paints
The first of mitred peers and Britain's saints.' p. 2.
'Ha! mark! what gleam is that which paints the air?
The blue serene expands! Is Boulter there?' p. 88.

The poet addresses Boulter's successor Hoadley, who he says,

'Shall equal him; while, like Elisha, you
Enjoy his spirit, and his mantle too.' p. 89.

A note to _mantle_ says 'Alluding to the metropolitan pallium.'

Boulter is the bishop in Pope's lines, (_Prologue to the Satires_, 1.

'Does not one table Bavius still admit?

'Still to one bishop Philips seem a wit?'

[943] See _ante_, p. 175. Hawkins writes (_Life_, p. 363):--'I
congratulated him length, on his being now engaged in a work that suited
his genius. His answer was:--"I look upon this as I did upon the
_Dictionary_; it is all work, and my inducement to it is not love or
desire of fame, but the want of money, which is the only motive to
writing that I know of."'

[944] They have been reprinted by Mr. Malone, in the Preface to his
edition of _Shakspeare_. BOSWELL.

[945] At Christmas, 1757, he said that he should publish about March,
1758 (_post_, Dec. 24, 1757). When March came he said that he should
publish before summer (_post_, March 1, 1758).

[946] In what Johnson says of Pope's slow progress in translating the
_Iliad_, he had very likely his own case in view. 'Indolence,
interruption, business, and pleasure all take their turns of
retardation; and every long work is lengthened by a thousand causes that
can, and ten thousand that cannot be recounted. Perhaps no extensive and
multifarious performance was ever effected within the term originally
fixed in the undertaker's mind. He that runs against time has an
antagonist not subject to casualties.' Johnson's _Works_, viii. 255. In
Prior's _Goldsmith_ (i. 238) we have the following extracts from letters
written by Grainger (_post_, March 21, 1776) to Dr. Percy:--'June 27,
1758. I have several times called on Johnson to pay him part of your
subscription [for his edition of _Shakespeare_]. I say, part, because he
never thinks of working if he has a couple of guineas in his pocket; but
if you notwithstanding order me, the whole shall be given him at once.'
'July 20, 1758. As to his _Shakespeare, movet sed non promovet_. I shall
feed him occasionally with guineas.'

[947] Hawkins (_Life_, p. 440) says that 'Reynolds and some other of his
friends, who were more concerned for his reputation than himself seemed
to be, contrived to entangle him by a wager, or some other pecuniary
engagement, to perform his task by a certain time.' Just as Johnson was
oppressed by the engagement that he had made to edit _Shakespeare_, so
was Cowper by his engagement to edit _Milton_. 'The consciousness that
there is so much to do and nothing done is a burthen I am not able to
bear. _Milton_ especially is my grievance, and I might almost as well be
haunted by his ghost, as goaded with such continual reproaches for
neglecting him.' Southey's _Cowper_, vii. 163.

[948] From _The Ghost_, Bk. iii. 1. 801. Boswell makes two slight errors
in quoting: 'You cash' should be 'their cash; and 'you know' should be
'we know.'

[949] See _post_, April 17, 1778.

[950] Mrs. Thrale writing to him in 1777, says:--'You would rather be
sick in London than well in the country.' _Piozzi Letters_. i. 394. Yet
Johnson, when he could afford to travel, spent far more time in the
country than is commonly thought. Moreover a great part of each summer
from 1766 to 1782 inclusive he spent at Streatham.

[951] The motto to this number

'Steriles nec legit arenas,
Ut caneret paucis, mersitque hoc pulvere verum.'

(Lucan).

Johnson has thus translated:--

'Canst thou believe the vast eternal mind
Was e'er to Syrts and Libyan sands confin'd?
That he would choose this waste, this barren ground,
To teach the thin inhabitants around,
And leave his truth in wilds and deserts drown'd?'

[952] It was added to the January number of 1758, but it was dropped in
the following numbers.

[953] According to the note in the _Gent. Mag_. the speech was delivered
'at a certain respectable talking society.' The chairman of the meeting
is addressed as Mr. President. The speech is vigorously written and is,
I have no doubt, by Johnson. 'It is fit,' the speaker says, 'that those
whom for the future we shall employ and pay may know they are the
servants of a people that _expect duty for their money_. It is said an
address expresses some distrust of the king, or may tend to disturb his
quiet. An English king, Mr. President, has no great right to quiet when
his people are in misery.'

[956] 'I have often observed with wonder, that we should know less of
Ireland than of any other country in Europe.' Temple's _Works_, iii. 82.

[957] The celebrated oratour, Mr. Flood has shewn himself to be of Dr.
Johnson's opinion; having by his will bequeathed his estate, after the
death of his wife Lady Frances, to the University of Dublin; 'desiring
that immediately after the said estate shall come into their possession,
they shall appoint two professors, one for the study of the native Erse
or Irish language, and the other for the study of Irish antiquities and
Irish history, and for the study of any other European language
illustrative of, or auxiliary to, the study of Irish antiquities or
Irish history; and that they shall give yearly two liberal premiums for
two compositions, one in verse, and the other in prose, in the Irish
language.' BOSWELL.

[958] Dr. T. Campbell records in his _Diary of a Visit to England_ (p.
62), that at the dinner at Messieurs Dilly's (_post_, April 5, 1775) he
'ventured to say that the first professors of Oxford, Paris, &c., were
Irish. "Sir," says Johnson, "I believe there is something in what you
say, and I am content with it, since they are not Scotch."'

[959] 'On Mr. Thrale's attack of apoplexy in 1779, Johnson wrote to Mrs.
Thrale:--'I remember Dr. Marsigli, an Italian physician, whose seizure
was more violent than Mr. Thrale's, for he fell down helpless, but his
case was not considered as of much danger, and he went safe home, and is
now a professor at Padua.' _Piozzi Letters_, ii. 48.

preceding year.' WARTON.-BOSWELL.

[962] 'Miss Jones lived at Oxford, and was often of our parties. She was
a very ingenious poetess, and published a volume of poems; and, on the
whole, was a most sensible, agreeable, and amiable woman. She was a
sister to the Reverend River Jones, Chanter of Christ Church Cathedral
at Oxford, and Johnson used to call her the _Chantress_. I have heard
him often address her in this passage from _Il Penseroso_:

"Thee, Chantress, oft the woods among I woo," etc.

She died unmarried.' WHARTON

[965] This letter is misdated. It was written in Jan. 1759, and not in
1758. Johnson says that he is forty-nine. In Jan. 1758 he was
forty-eight. He mentions the performance of _Cleane_, which was at the
end of 1758; and he says that 'Murphy is to have his _Orphan of China_
acted next month.' It was acted in the spring of 1759.

'Though grief and fondness in my breast rebel,
When injured Thales bids the town farewell,
Yet still my calmer thoughts his choice commend,

To breathe in distant fields a purer air,
And fixed on Cambria's solitary shore
Give to St. David one true Briton more.'

Johnson's _London_, l. 1.

[967] Mr. Garrick. BOSWELL.

[968] Mr. Dodsley, the Authour of _Cleone_. BOSWELL. Garrick, according
to Davies, had rejected Dodsley's _Cleone_, 'and had termed it a cruel,
bloody, and unnatural play.' Davies's _Garrick_, i. 223. Johnson himself
said of it:--'I am afraid there is more blood than brains.' _Post_,
1780, in Mr. Langton's _Collection_. The night it was brought out at
Covent Garden, Garrick appeared for the first time as Marplot in the
_Busy Body_ at Drury Lane. The next morning he wrote to congratulate
Dodsley on his success, and asked him at the same time to let him know
how he could support his interest without absolutely giving up his own.
To this Dodsley returned a cold reply. Garrick wrote back as follows:--

'Master Robert Dodsley,

When I first read your peevish answer to my well-meant proposal to you,
I was much disturbed at it--but when I considered, that some minds
cannot bear the smallest portion of success, I most sincerely pitied
you; and when I found in the same letter, that you were graciously
pleased to dismiss me from your acquaintance, I could not but confess so
apparent an obligation, and am with due acknowledgements,

Master Robert Dodsley,

Your most obliged

David Garrick.'

Garrick _Corres_., i. 80 (where the letters that passed are wrongly
dated 1757). Mrs. Bellamy in her _Life_ (iii. 109) says that on the
evening of the performance she was provoked by something that Dodsley
said, 'which,' she continues, 'made me answer that good man with a
petulance which afterwards gave me uneasiness. I told him that I had a
reputation to lose as an actress; but, as for his piece, Mr. Garrick had
anticipated the damnation of it publicly, the preceding evening, at the
Bedford Coffee-house, where he had declared that it could not pass
muster, as it was the very worst piece ever exhibited.' Shenstone
(_Works_, iii. 288) writing five weeks after the play was brought out,
says:--'Dodsley is now going to print his fourth edition. He sold 2000
of his first edition the very first day he published it.' The price was
eighteen-pence.

[969] Mrs. Bellamy (_Life_, iii. 108) says that Johnson was present at
the last rehearsal. 'When I came to repeat, "Thou shalt not murder," Dr.
Johnson caught me by the arm, and that somewhat too briskly, saying, at
the same time, "It is a commandment, and must be spoken, Thou shalt
_not_ murder." As I had not then the honour of knowing personally that
great genius, I was not a little displeased at his inforcing his
instructions with so much vehemence.' The next night she heard, she
says, amidst the general applause, 'the same voice which had instructed
me in the commandment, exclaim aloud from the pit, "I will write a copy
of verses upon her myself." I knew that my success was insured.' See
_post_, May 11, 1783.

[970] Dodsley had published his _London_ and his _Vanity of Human
Wishes_ (_ante_, pp. 124, 193), and had had a large share in the
_Dictionary_, (_ante_, p. 183).

[971] It is to this that Churchill refers in the following lines:--

'Let them [the Muses] with Glover o'er Medea doze;
Let them with Dodsley wail Cleone's woes,
Whilst he, fine feeling creature, all in tears,
Melts as they melt, and weeps with weeping Peers.'

_The Journey_. _Poems_, ii. 328.

[972] See _post_ p. 350, note.

[973] Mr. Samuel Richardson, authour of _Clarissa_. BOSWELL.

[974] In 1753 when in Devonshire he charged five guineas a head
(Taylor's _Reynolds_, i. 89); shortly afterwards, when he removed to
London, twelve guineas (_ib_. p. 101); in 1764, thirty guineas; for a
whole length 150 guineas (_ib_. p. 224). Northcote writes that 'he
sometimes has lamented the being interrupted in his work by idle
visitors, saying, "those persons do not consider that my time is worth
to me five guineas an hour."' Northcote's _Reynolds_, i. 83.

[975] 'Miss Reynolds at first amused herself by painting miniature
portraits, and in that part of the art was particularly successful. In
her attempts at oil-painting, however, she did not succeed, which made
Reynolds say jestingly, that her pictures in that way made other people
laugh and him cry; and as he did not approve of her painting in oil, she
generally did it by stealth.' _Ib_. ii. 160.

[976] Murphy was far from happy. The play was not produced till April;
by the date of Johnson's letter, he had not by any means reached the end
of what he calls 'the first, and indeed, the last, disagreeable
controversy that he ever had with Mr. Garrick.' Murphy's _Garrick_,
p. 213.

[977] This letter was an answer to one in which was enclosed a draft for
the payment of some subscriptions to his _Shakspeare_. BOSWELL.

[978] In the Preface he says:--(_Works_, v. 52) 'I have not passed over
with affected superiority what is equally difficult to the reader and to
myself, but where I could not instruct him, have owned my ignorance.'

[979] Northcote gives the following account of this same garret in
describing how Reynolds introduced Roubiliac to Johnson. 'Johnson
received him with much civility, and took them up into a garret, which
he considered as his library; where, besides his books, all covered with
dust, there was an old crazy deal table, and a still worse and older
elbow chair, having only three legs. In this chair Johnson seated
himself, after having, with considerable dexterity and evident practice,
first drawn it up against the wall, which served to support it on that
side on which the leg was deficient.' Northcote's _Reynolds_, i. 75.
Miss Reynolds improves on the account. She says that 'before Johnson had
the pension he literally dressed like a beggar; and, from what I have
been told, he as literally lived as such; at least as to common
conveniences in his apartments, wanting even a chair to sit on,
particularly in his study, where a gentleman who frequently visited him,
whilst writing his _Idlers_, constantly found him at his desk, sitting
on one with three legs; and on rising from it, he remarked that Dr.
Johnson never forgot its defect, but would either hold it in his hand,
or place it with great composure against some support, taking no notice
of its imperfection to his visitor. It was remarkable in Johnson, that
no external circumstances ever prompted him to make any apology, or to
seem even sensible of their existence.' Croker's _Boswell_, p. 832.
There can be little question that she is describing the same room--a
room in a house in which Miss Williams was lodged, and most likely Mr.
Levet, and in which Mr. Burney dined; and in which certainly there must
have been chairs. Yet Mr. Carlyle, misled by her account, says:--'In his
apartments, at one time, there were unfortunately no chairs.' Carlyle's
_Miscellanies_, ed. 1872, iv. 127.

[980] In his _Life of Pope_ (_Works_, viii. 272) Johnson calls Theobald
'a man of heavy diligence, with very slender powers.' In the Preface to
Shakspeare he admits that 'what little he did was commonly right.' _Ib_.
v. 137. The Editors of the _Cambridge Shakespeare_ on the other hand
say:--'Theobald, as an Editor, is incomparably superior to his
predecessors, and to his immediate successor Warburton, although the
latter had the advantage of working on his materials. Many most
brilliant emendations are due to him.' On Johnson's statement that
'Warburton would make two-and-fifty Theobalds, cut into slices,' they
write:--'From this judgment, whether they be compared as critics or
editors, we emphatically dissent.' _Cambridge Shakespeare_, i., xxxi.,
xxxiv., note. Among Theobald's 'brilliant emendations' are 'a'babbled of
green fields' (_Henry V_, ii. 3), and 'lackeying the varying tide.'
(_Antony and Cleopatra_, i.4).

man living_, 1749.' _Brit. Mus. Catal_.

[982] 'Mallet, by address or accident, perhaps by his dependence on the
prince [of Wales], found his way to Bolingbroke, a man whose pride and
petulance made his kindness difficult to gain or keep, and whom Mallet
was content to court by an act, which, I hope, was unwillingly
performed. When it was found that Pope had clandestinely printed an
unauthorised number of the pamphlet called _The Patriot King_,
Bolingbroke, in a fit of useless fury, resolved to blast his memory, and
employed Mallet (1749) as the executioner of his vengeance. Mallet had
not virtue, or had not spirit, to refuse the office; and was rewarded
not long after with the legacy of Lord Bolingbroke's works.' Johnson's
_Works_, viii. 467. See _ante_, p. 268, and Walpole's _Letters_,

[985] In the two years in which Johnson wrote for this paper it saw many
changes. The first _Idler_ appeared in No. 2 of the _Universal Chronicle
or Weekly Gazette_, which was published not by Newbery, but by J. Payne.
On April 29, this paper took the title of _Payne's Universal Chronicle_,
etc. On Jan. 6, 1759, it resumed the old title and was published by R.
Stevens. On Jan. 5, 1760, the title was changed to _The Universal
Chronicle and Westminster Journal_, and it was published by W. Faden and
R. Stevens. On March 15, 1760, it was published by R. Stevens alone. The
paper consisted of eight pages. _The Idler_, which varied in length,
came first, and was printed in larger characters, much like a leading
article. The changes in title and ownership seem to show that in spite
of Johnson's contributions it was not a successful publication.

[986] 'Those papers may be considered as a kind of syllabus of all
Reynolds's future discourses, and certainly occasioned him some thinking
in their composition. I have heard him say, that Johnson required them
from him on a sudden emergency, and on that account, he sat up the whole
night to complete them in time; and by it he was so much disordered,
that it produced a vertigo in his head.' Northcote's _Reynolds_, i. 89,
Reynolds must have spoken of only one paper; as the three, appearing as
they did on Sept. 29, Oct. 20, and Nov. 10, could not have been required
at one time.

[987] 'To be idle and to be poor have always been reproaches, and
therefore every man endeavours with his utmost care to hide his poverty
from others, and his idleness from himself.' _The Idler_, No. 17.

[988] Prayers and Meditations, p. 30 [36], BOSWELL.

[989] In July, 1759.

[990] This number was published a few days after his mother's death. It
is in the form of a letter, which is thus introduced:-'The following
letter relates to an affliction perhaps not necessary to be imparted to
the publick; but I could not persuade myself to suppress it, because I
think I know the sentiments to be sincere, and I feel no disposition to
provide for this day any other entertainment.'

[991] In the table of contents the title of No. 58 is, 'Expectations of
pleasure frustrated.' In the original edition of _The Idler_ no titles
are given. In this paper he shews that 'nothing is more hopeless than a
scheme of merriment.'

[992] In this paper he begins by considering, 'why the only thinking
being of this globe is doomed to think merely to be wretched, and to
pass his time from youth to age in fearing or in suffering calamities.'
He ends by asserting that 'of what virtue there is, misery produces far
the greater part.'

[993] 'There are few things,' he writes, 'not purely evil, of which we
can say, without some emotion of uneasiness, _this is the last_.... The
secret horrour of the last is inseparable from a thinking being, whose
life is limited, and to whom death is dreadful.'

[994] 'I asked him one day, why the _Idlers_ were published without
mottoes. He replied, that it was forborne the better to conceal himself,
and escape discovery. "But let us think of some now," said he, "for the
next edition. We can fit the two volumnes in two hours, can't we?"
Accordingly he recollected, and I wrote down these following (nine
mottoes) till come friend coming in, in about five minutes, put an end
to our further progress on the subject.' _Piossi Letters_, ii. 388.

[995] See _post_, July 14 and 26, 1763, April 14, 1775, and Aug. 2,
1784, note for instances in which Johnson ridicules the notion that
weather and seasons have any necessary effect on man; also April 17,
1778. In the _Life of Milton_ (_Works_. vii. 102), he writes:--'this
dependence of the soul upon the seasons, those temporary and periodical
ebbs and flows of intellect, may, I suppose, justly be derided as the
fumes of vain imagination. _Sapiens dominabitur astro_. The author that
thinks himself weather-bound will find, with a little help from
hellebore, that he is only idle or exhausted. But while this notion has
possession of the head, it produces the inability with it supposes. Our
powers owe much of their energy to our hopes; _possunt quin posse
vidertur_.' Boswell records, in his _Hebrides_ (Aug. 16, 1773), that
when 'somebody talked of happy moments for composition,' Johnson
said:--'Nay, a man may write at any time, if he will set himself
_doggedly_ to it.' Reynolds, who Alas! avowed how much he had learnt
from Johnson (_ante_, p. 245), says much the same in his _Seventh
Discourse_: 'But when, in plain prose, we gravely talk of courting the
Muse in shady bowers; waiting the call and inspiration of Genius ... of
attending to times and seasons when the imagination shoots with the
greatest vigour, whether at the summer solstice or the vernal equinox
... when we talk such language or entertain such sentiments as these, we
generally rest contented with mere words, or at best entertain notions
not only groundless but pernicious.' Reynolds's _Works_, i. 150. On the
other hand, in 1773 Johnson recorded:--'Between Easter and Whitsuntide,
having always considered that time as propitious to study, I attempted
to learn the Low-Dutch language.' _Post_, under May 9, 1773. In _The
Rambler_, No. 80, he says:--'To the men of study and imagination the
winter is generally the chief time of labour. Gloom and silence produce
composure of mind and concentration of ideas.' In a letter to Mrs.
Thrale, written in 1775, he says:--'Most men have their bright and their
Cloudy days, at least they have days when they put their powers into
act, and days when they suffer them to repose.' _Piozzi Letters_, i.
265. In 1781 he wrote:--'I thought myself above assistance or
obstruction from the seasons; but find the autumnal blast sharp and
nipping, and the fading world an uncomfortable prospect.' _Ib_. ii. 220.
Again, in the last year of his life he wrote:--'The: weather, you know,
has not been balmy. I am now reduced to think, and am at least content
to talk, of the weather. Pride must have a fall.' _Post_, Aug. 2, 1784.

[996] Addison's _Cato_, act i. sc. 4.

[997] Johnson, reviewing the Duchess of Marlborough's attack on Queen
Mary, says (_Works_, vi. 8):--'This is a character so different from all
those that have been hitherto given of this celebrated princess, that
the reader stands in suspense, till he considers that ... it has
hitherto had this great advantage, that it has only been compared with
those of kings.'

[998] Johnson had explained how it comes to pass that Englishmen talk so
commonly of the weather. He continues:--'Such is the reason of our
practice; and who shall treat it with contempt? Surely not the attendant
on a court, whose business is to watch the looks of a being weak and
foolish as himself, and whose vanity is to recount the names of men, who
might drop into nothing, and leave no vacuity.... The weather is a
nobler and more interesting subject; it is the present state of the
skies and of the earth, on which plenty and famine are suspended, on
which millions depend for the necessaries of life.' 'Garrick complained
that when he went to read before the court, not a look or a murmur
testified approbation; there was a profound stillness--every one only
watched to see what the king thought.' Hazlitt's _Conversations of
Northcote_, p. 262.

[999] _The Idler_, No. 90. See _post_, April 3, 1773, where he declaims
against action in public speaking.

[1000] He now and then repeats himself. Thus, in _The Idler_, No. 37, he
moralises on the story, how Socrates, passing through the fair at
Athens, cried out:--'How many things are here which I do not need!'
though he had already moralised on it in _the Adventurer_, Nos. 67, 119.

Forster's _Goldsmith_, i. 204.

If this account is correctly printed, the sale must have been slow. The
first edition (2 vols. 5s.) was published in Oct. 1761, (_Gent. Mag_.
xxxi. 479). Johnson is called Dr. in the account; but he was not made an
LL.D. till July 1765. Prior, in his _Life of Goldsmith_ (i. 459),
publishes an account between Goldsmith and Newbery in which the first
entry is:--

 '1761. Oct. 14, 1 set of
   _The Idler_. . . . . £0 50 0.'

Johnson, as Newbery's papers show, a year later bought a copy of
Goldsmith's _Life of Nash_; _ib_. p. 405.

[1004] See _ante_, p. 306.

[1005] This paper may be found in Stockdale's supplemental volume of
Johnson's _Miscellaneous Pieces_. BOSWELL. Stockdale's supplemental
volumes--for there are two--are vols. xii. and xiii. of what is known as
'Hawkins's edition.' In this paper (_Works_, iv. 450) he represents in a
fable two vultures speculating on that mischievous being, man, 'who is
the only beast who kills that which he does not devour,' who at times is
seen to move in herds, while 'there is in every herd one that gives
directions to the rest, and seems to be more eminently delighted with a
wide carnage.'

[1008] Old Mr. Langton's niece. See _post,_ July 14, 1763.

[1009] 'Mr. Langton.' WARTON.--BOSWELL.

[1010] Boswell records:--'Lady Di Beauclerk told me that Langton had
never been to see her since she came to Richmond, his head was so full
of the militia and Greek. "Why," said I, "Madam, he is of such a length
he is awkward and not easily moved." "But," said she, "if he had lain
himself at his length, his feet had been in London, and his head might
have been here _eodem die_."' _Boswelliana_, p. 297.

[1011] 'Part of the impression of the _Shakespeare_, which Dr. Johnson
conducted alone, and published by subscription. This edition came out in
1765.' WARTON.--BOSWELL.

[1012] Stockdale records (_Memoirs_, ii. 191), that after he had entered
on his charge as domestic tutor to Lord Craven's son, he called on
Johnson, who asked him how he liked his place. On his hesitating to
answer, he said: 'You must expect insolence.' He added that in his youth
he had entertained great expectations from a powerful family. "At
length," he said, "I found that their promises, and consequently my
expectations, vanished into air.... But, Sir, they would have treated me
much worse, if they had known that motives from which I paid my court to
them were purely selfish, and what opinion I had formed of them." He
added, that since he knew mankind, he had not, on any occasion, been the
sport of such delusion and that he had never been disappointed by anyone
but himself.'

[1013] This, and some of the other letters to Langton, were not received
by Boswell till the first volume of the second edition had been carried
through the press. He gave them as a supplement to the second volume.
The date of this letter was there wrongly given as June 27, 1758. In the
third edition it was corrected. Nevertheless the letter was misplaced as
if the wrong date were the right one. Langton, as I have shewn (_ante_,
p. 247), subscribed the articles at Oxford on July 7, 1757. He must have
come into residence, as Johnson did (_ante_, p. 58), some little while
before this subscription.

[1014] Major-General Alexander Dury, of the first regiment of
foot-guards, who fell in the gallant discharge of his duty, near St.
Cas, in the well-known unfortunate expedition against France, in 1758.
His lady and Mr. Langton's mother was sisters. He left an only son,
Lieutenant-Colonel Dury, who has a company in the same regiment.
BOSWELL. The expedition had been sent against St. Malo early in
September. Failing in the attempt, the land forces retreated to St. Cas,
where, while embarking, they were attacked by the French. About 400 of
our soldiers were made prisoners, and 600 killed and wounded. _Ann.
Reg_.i.68.

[1015] See _post_, 1770, in Dr. Maxwell's _Collectanea_.

[1016] Hawkins's _Life of Johnson_, p. 365. BOSWELL. 'In the beginning
of the year 1759 an event happened for which it might be imagined he was
well prepared, the death of his mother, who had attained the age of
ninety; but he, whose mind had acquired no firmness by the contemplation
of mortality, was as little able to sustain the shock, as he would have
been had this loss befallen him in his nonage.'

[1017] We may apply to Johnson in his behaviour to his mother what he
said of Pope in his behaviour to his parents:--'Whatever was his pride,
to them he was obedient; and whatever was his irritability, to them he
was gentle. Life has among its soothing and quiet comforts few things
better to give than such a son.' Johnson's _Works_, viii. 281. In _The
Idler_ of January 27, 1759 (No. 41), Johnson shews his grief for his
loss. 'The last year, the last day must come. It has come, and is past.
The life which made my own life pleasant is at an end, and the gates of
death are shut upon my prospects.... Such is the condition of our
present existence that life must one time lose its associations, and
every inhabitant of the earth must walk downward to the grave alone and
unregarded, without any partner of his joy or grief, without any
interested witness of his misfortunes or success. Misfortune, indeed, he
may yet feel; for where is the bottom of the misery of man? But what is
success to him that has none to enjoy it? Happiness is not found in
self-contemplation; it is perceived only when it is reflected from
another.' In _Rasselas_ (ch. xlv.) he makes a sage say with a
sigh:--'Praise is to have an old man an empty sound. I have neither
mother to be delighted with the reputation of her son, nor wife to
partake the honours of her husband.' He here says once more what he had
already said in his _Letter to Lord Chesterfield_ (_ante_, p. 261), and
in the _Preface to the Dictionary_ (_ante_, p. 297).

[1018] Writing to his Birmingham friend, Mr. Hector, on Oct. 7, 1756, he
said:--'I have been thinking every month of coming down into the
country, but every month has brought its hinderances. From that kind of
melancholy indisposition which I had when we lived together at
Birmingham I have never been free, but have always had it operating
against my health and my life with more or less violence. I hope however
to see all my friends, all that are remaining, in no very long time.'
_Notes and Queries_, 6th S. iii. 301. No doubt his constant poverty and
the need that he was under of making 'provision for the day that was
passing over him' had had much to do in keeping him from a journey to
Lichfield. A passage in one of his letters shews that fourteen years
later the stage-coach took twenty-six hours in going from London to
Lichfield. (_Piozzi Letters_, i. 55.) The return journey was very
uncertain; for 'our carriages,' he wrote, 'are only such as pass through
the place sometimes full and sometimes vacant.' A traveller had to watch
for a place (_ib_. p. 51). As measured by time London was, in 1772, one
hour farther from Lichfield than it now is from Marseilles. It is
strange, when we consider the long separation between Johnson and his
mother, that in _Rasselas_, written just after her death, he makes Imlac
say:-'There is such communication [in Europe] between distant places,
that one friend can hardly be said to be absent from another.'
_Rasselas_, chap, xi. His step-daughter, Miss Porter, though for many
years she was well off, had never been to London. _Post_, March 23,
1776. Nay, according to Horace Walpole (_Memoirs of the Reign of George
III_, iv. 327), 'George III. had never seen the sea, nor ever been
thirty miles from London at the age of thirty-four.'

[1019] For the letters written at this time by Johnson to his mother and
Miss Porter, see Appendix B.

[1020] _Rasselas_ was published in two volumes, duodecimo, and was sold
for five shillings. It was reviewed in the _Gent. Mag_. for April, and
was no doubt published in that month. In a letter to Miss Porter dated
March 23, 1759 (See Appendix), Johnson says:--'I am going to publish a
little story-book, which I will send you when it is out.' I may here
remark that the _Gent. Mag_. was published at the end of the month, or
even later. Thus the number for April, 1759, contains news as late as
April 30. The name _Rasselas_ Johnson got from Lobo's _Voyage to
Abyssinia_. On p. 102 of that book he mentions 'Rassela Christos,
Lieutenant-General to _Abysinia; Sultan Segued.' On p. 262 he explains
the meaning of the first part of the word:--'There is now a
Generalissimo established under the title of _Ras_, or _Chief_.' The
title still exists. Colonel Gordon mentions Ras Arya and Ras Aloula. The
Rev. W. West, in his _Introduction to Rasselas_, p. xxxi (Sampson Low
and Co.), says:--'The word _Ras_, which is common to the Amharic,
Arabic, and Hebrew tongues, signifies a _head_, and hence a prince,
chief, or captain.... Sela Christos means either "Picture of Christ," or
"For the sake of Christ."'

[1021] Hawkins's Johnson, p. 367.

[1022] See _post_, June 2, 1781. Finding it then accidentally in a
chaise with Mr. Boswell, he read it eagerly. This was doubtless long
after his declaration to Sir Joshua Reynolds. MALONE.

[1023] Baretti told Malone that 'Johnson insisted on part of the money
being paid immediately, and accordingly received £70. Any other person
with the degree of reputation he then possessed would have got £400 for
that work, but he never understood the art of making the most of his
productions.' Prior's _Malone_, p. 160. Some of the other circumstances
there related by Baretti are not correct.

[1024] Hawkesworth received £6000 for his revision of Cook's _Voyages_;
_post_, May 7, 1773.

[1025] See _post_, March 4, 1773.

[1026] _Ecclesiastes_, i. 14.

[1027] See _post_, May 16, 1778. It should seem that _Candide_ was
published in the latter half of February 1759. Grimm in his letter of
March 1, speaks of its having just appeared. 'M. de Voltaire vient de
nous égayer par un petit roman.' He does not mention it in his previous
letter of Feb. 15. _Grimm, Carres. Lit_. (edit. 1829), ii. 296.
Johnson's letter to Miss Porter, quoted in the Appendix, shows that
Rasselas was written before March 23; how much earlier cannot be known.
_Candide_ is in the May list of books in the _Gent. Mag_. (pp. 233-5),
price 2_s_. 6_d_., and with it two translations, each price 1_s_. 6_d_.

[1028] See _post_, June 13, 1763.

[1029] In the original,--'which, perhaps, prevails.' _Rasselas_, ch.
xxxi.

[1030] This is the second time that Boswell puts 'morbid melancholy' in
quotation marks (ante, p. 63). Perhaps he refers to a passage in
Hawkins's _Johnson_ (p. 287), where the author speaks of Johnson's
melancholy as 'this morbid affection, as he was used to call it.'

[1031] 'Perfect through sufferings.' _Hebrews_, ii. 10.

[1032] Perhaps the reference is to the conclusion of _Le Monde comme il
va_:--'Il résolut ... de laisser aller _le monde comme il va_; car, dit
il, _si tout riest pas bien, tout est passable_.'

[1033] Gray, _On a Distant Prospect of Eton College_.

[1034] Johnson writing to Mrs. Thrale said:--'_Vivite lacti_ is one of
the great rules of health.' _Piozzi Letters_, ii. 55. 'It was the motto
of a bishop very eminent for his piety and good works in King Charles
the Second's reign, _Inservi Deo et laetare_--"Serve God and be
cheerful."' Addison's _Freeholder_, No. 45.

[1035] Literary and Moral Character of Dr. Johnson. BOSWELL.

[1036] This paper was in such high estimation before it was collected
into volumes, that it was seized on with avidity by various publishers
of news-papers and magazines, to enrich their publications. Johnson, to
put a stop to this unfair proceeding, wrote for the _Universal
Chronicle_ the following advertisement; in which there is, perhaps, more
pomp of words than the occasion demanded:

'London, January 5, 1759. ADVERTISEMENT. The proprietors of the paper
intitled _The Idler_, having found that those essays are inserted in the
news-papers and magazines with so little regard to justice or decency,
that the _Universal Chronicle_, in which they first appear, is not
always mentioned, think it necessary to declare to the publishers of
those collections, that however patiently they have hitherto endured
these injuries, made yet more injurious by contempt, they have now
determined to endure them no longer. They have already seen essays, for
which a very large price is paid, transferred, with the most shameless
rapacity, into the weekly or monthly compilations, and their right, at
least for the present, alienated from them, before they could themselves
be said to enjoy it. But they would not willingly be thought to want
tenderness, even for men by whom no tenderness hath been shewn. The past
is without remedy, and shall be without resentment. But those who have
been thus busy with their sickles in the fields of their neighbours, are
henceforward to take notice, that the time of impunity is at an end.
Whoever shall, without our leave, lay the hand of rapine upon our
papers, is to expect that we shall vindicate our due, by the means which
justice prescribes, and which are warranted by the immemorial
prescriptions of honourable trade. We shall lay hold, in our turn, on
their copies, degrade them from the pomp of wide margin and diffuse
typography, contract them into a narrow space, and sell them at an
humble price; yet not with a view of growing rich by confiscations, for
we think not much better of money got by punishment than by crimes. We
shall, therefore, when our losses are repaid, give what profit shall
remain to the _Magdalens_; for we know not who can be more properly
taxed for the support of penitent prostitutes, than prostitutes in whom
there yet appears neither penitence nor shame.' BOSWELL.

[1037] I think that this letter belongs to a later date, probably to
1765 or 1766. As we learn, _post_, April 10, 1776, Simpson was a
barrister 'who fell into a dissipated course of life.' On July 2, 1765,
Johnson records that he repaid him ten guineas which he had borrowed in
the lifetime of Mrs. Johnson (his wife). He also lent him ten guineas
more. If it was in 1759 that Simpson was troubled by small debts, it is
most unlikely that Johnson let six years more pass without repaying him
a loan which even then was at least of seven years' standing. Moreover,
in this letter Johnson writes:--'I have been invited, or have invited
myself, to several parts of the kingdom.' The only visits, it seems,
that he paid between 1754-1762 were to Oxford in 1759 and to Lichfield
in the winter of 1761-2. After 1762, when his pension gave him means, he
travelled frequently. Besides all this, he says of his step-daughter:--
'I will not incommode my dear Lucy by coming to Lichfield, while her
present lodging is of any use to her.' Miss Porter seems to have lived
in his house till she had built one for herself. Though his letter to
her of Jan. 10, 1764 (Croker's _Boswell_, p. 163), shews that it was
then building, yet she had not left his house on Jan. 14, 1766 (_ib_.
p. 173).

'To JOSEPH SIMPSON, ESQ.

'DEAR SIR,

'Your father's inexorability not only grieves but amazes me[1038]: he is
your father; he was always accounted a wise man; nor do I remember any
thing to the disadvantage of his good-nature; but in his refusal to
assist you there is neither good-nature, fatherhood, nor wisdom. It is
the practice of good-nature to overlook faults which have already, by
the consequences, punished the delinquent. It is natural for a father to
think more favourably than others of his children; and it is always wise
to give assistance while a little help will prevent the necessity
of greater.

[1038] In the _Rambler_, No. 148, entitled 'The cruelty of parental
tyranny,' Johnson, after noticing the oppression inflicted by the
perversion of legal authority, says:--'Equally dangerous and equally
detestable are the cruelties often exercised in private families, under
the venerable sanction of parental authority.' He continues:--'Even
though no consideration should be paid to the great law of social
beings, by which every individual is commanded to consult the happiness
of others, yet the harsh parent is less to be vindicated than any other
criminal, because he less provides for the happiness of himself.' See
also _post_, March 29, 1779. A passage in one of Boswell's _Letters to
Temple_ (p. 111) may also be quoted here:--'The time was when such a
letter from my father as the one I enclose would have depressed; but I
am now firm, and, as my revered friend, Mr. Samuel Johnson, used to say,
_I feel the privileges of an independent human being_; however, it is
hard that I cannot have the pious satisfaction of being well with
my father.'

[1039] Perhaps 'Van,' for Vansittart.

[1040] Lord Stowell informs me that Johnson prided himself in being,
during his visits to Oxford, accurately academic in all points: and he
wore his gown almost _ostentatiously_. CROKER.

[1041] Dr. Robert Vansittart, of the ancient and respectable family of
that name in Berkshire. He was eminent for learning and worth, and much
esteemed by Dr. Johnson. BOSWELL. Johnson perhaps proposed climbing over
the wall on the day on which 'University College witnessed him drink
three bottles of port without being the worse for it.' _Post_, April
7, 1778.

[1042] _Gentleman's Magazine_, April, 1785. BOSWELL. The speech was made
on July 7, 1759, the last day of 'the solemnity of the installment' of
the Earl of Westmoreland as Chancellor of the University. On the 3rd
'the ceremony began with a grand procession of noblemen, doctors, &c.,
in their proper habits, which passed through St. Mary's, and was there
joined by the Masters of Arts in their proper habits; and from thence
proceeded to the great gate of the Sheldonian Theatre, in which the most
numerous and brilliant assembly of persons of quality and distinction
was seated, that had ever been seen there on any occasion.' _Gent. Mag_.
xxix. 342. Would that we had some description of Johnson, as, in his new
and handsome gown, he joined the procession among the Masters! See
_ante_, p. 281.

BOSWELL. The chance of death from disease would seem also to have been
greater on the ship than in a jail. In _The Idler_ (No. 38) Johnson
estimates that one in four of the prisoners dies every year. In his
Review of Hanway's _Essay on Tea_ (_Works_, vi. 31) he states that he is
told that 'of the five or six hundred seamen sent to China, sometimes
half, commonly a third part, perish in the voyage.' See _post_,
April 10, 1778.

[1045] In my first edition this word was printed _Chum_, as it appears,
in one of Mr. Wilkes's _Miscellanies_, and I animadverted on Dr.
Smollet's ignorance; for which let me propitiate the _manes_ of that
ingenious and benevolent gentleman. CHUM was certainly a mistaken
reading for _Cham_, the title of the Sovereign of Tartary, which is well
applied to Johnson, the Monarch of Literature; and was an epithet
familiar to Smollet. See _Roderick Random_, chap. 56. For this
correction I am indebted to Lord Palmerston, whose talents and literary
acquirements accord well with his respectable pedigree of
TEMPLE BOSWELL.

After the publication of the second edition of this work, the author was
furnished by Mr. Abercrombie, of Philadelphia, with the copy of a letter
written by Dr. John Armstrong, the poet, to Dr. Smollet at Leghorne,
containing the following paragraph:--'As to the K. Bench patriot, it is
hard to say from what motive he published a letter of yours asking some
triffling favour of him in behalf of somebody, for whom the great CHAM
of literature, Mr. Johnson, had interested himself.' MALONE. In the
first edition Boswell had said:--'Had Dr. Smollet been bred at an
English University, he would have know that a _chum_ is a student who
lives with another in a chamber common to them both. A _chum of
literature_ is nonsense.'

[1046] In a note to that piece of bad book-making, Almon's _Memoirs of
Wilkes_ (i. 47), this allusion is thus explained:-'A pleasantry of Mr.
Wilkes on that passage in Johnson's _Grammar of the English Tongue_,
prefixed to the Dictionary--"_H_ seldom, perhaps never, begins any but
the first syllable."' For this 'pleasantry' see _ante_, p. 300.

[1047] Mr. Croker says that he was not discharged till June 1760. Had he
been discharged at once he would have found Johnson moving from Gough
Square to Staple Inn; for in a letter to Miss Porter, dated March 23,
1739, given in the Appendix, Johnson said:-'I have this day moved my
things, and you are now to direct to me at Staple Inn.'

[1048] _Prayers and Meditations _, pp. 30 [39] and 40. BOSWELL.

[1049] 'I have left off housekeeping' wrote Johnson to Langton on Jan.
9, 1759. Murphy (_Life_, p. 90), writing of the beginning of the year
1759, says:--'Johnson now found it necessary to retrench his expenses.
He gave up his house in Gough Square. Mrs. Williams went into lodgings
[See _post_, July 1, 1763]. He retired to Gray's-Inn, [he had first
moved to Staple Inn], and soon removed to chambers in the Inner
Temple-lane, where he lived in poverty, total idleness, and the pride of
literature, _Magni stat nominis umbra_. Mr. Fitzherbert used to say that
he paid a morning visit to Johnson, intending from his chambers to send
a letter into the city; but, to his great surprise, he found an authour
by profession without pen, ink, or paper.' (It was Mr. Fitzherbert, who
sent Johnson some wine. See _ante_, p. 305, note 2. See also _post_,
Sept. 15, 1777). The following documents confirm Murphy's statement of
Johnson's poverty at this time:

'May 19, 1759.

'I promise to pay to Mr. Newbery the sum of forty-two pounds, nineteen
shillings, and ten pence on demand, value received. £42 19 10.

'Sam. Johnson.'

'March 20, 1760.

'I promise to pay to Mr. Newbery the sum of thirty pounds upon demand.,
£30 0 0.

'Sam. Johnson.'

In 1751 he had thrice borrowed money of Newbery, but the total amount of
the loans was only four guineas. Prior's _Goldsmith_, i. 340. With
Johnson's want of pen, ink, and paper we may compare the account that he
gives of Savage's destitution (_Works_, viii. 3):--'Nor had he any other
conveniences for study than the fields or the streets allowed him; there
he used to walk and form his speeches, and afterwards step into a shop,
beg for a few moments the use of the pen and ink, and write down what he
had composed upon paper which he had picked up by accident.' Hawkins
(_Life_, p. 383) says that Johnson's chambers were two doors down the
Inner Temple Lane. 'I have been told,' he continues, 'by his neighbour
at the corner, that during the time he dwelt there, more inquiries were
made at his shop for Mr. Johnson, than for all the inhabitants put
together of both the Inner and Middle Temple.' In a court opening out of
Fleet Street, Goldsmith at this very time was still more miserably
lodged. In the beginning of March 1759, Percy found him 'employed in
writing his _Enquiry into Polite Learning_ in a wretched dirty room, in
which there was but one chair, and when he from civility offered it to
his visitant, himself was obliged to sit in the window.' _Goldsmith's
Misc. Works_, i. 61.

[1050] Sir John Hawkins (Life, p. 373) has given a long detail of it, in
that manner vulgarly, but significantly, called rigmarole; in which,
amidst an ostentatious exhibition of arts and artists, he talks of
'proportions of a column being taken from that of the human figure, and
_adjusted by Nature_--masculine and feminine--in a man, sesquioctave of
the head, and in a woman _sesquinonal_;' nor has he failed to introduce
a jargon of musical terms, which do not seem much to correspond with the
subject, but serve to make up the heterogeneous mass. To follow the
Knight through all this, would be an useless fatigue to myself, and not
a little disgusting to my readers. I shall, therefore, only make a few
remarks upon his statement.--He seems to exult in having detected
Johnson in procuring 'from a person eminently skilled in Mathematicks
and the principles of architecture, answers to a string of questions
drawn up by himself, touching the comparative strength of semicircular
and elliptical arches.' Now I cannot conceive how Johnson could have
acted more wisely. Sir John complains that the opinion of that excellent
mathematician, Mr. Thomas Simpson, did not preponderate in favour of the
semicircular arch. But he should have known, that however eminent Mr.
Simpson was in the higher parts of abstract mathematical science, he was
little versed in mixed and practical mechanicks. Mr. Muller, of Woolwich
Academy, the scholastick father of all the great engineers which this
country has employed for forty years, decided the question by declaring
clearly in favour of the elliptical arch.

It is ungraciously suggested, that Johnson's motive for opposing Mr.
Mylne's scheme may have been his prejudice against him as a native of
North Britain; when, in truth, as has been stated, he gave the aid of
his able pen to a friend, who was one of the candidates; and so far was
he from having any illiberal antipathy to Mr. Mylne, that he afterwards
lived with that gentleman upon very agreeable terms of acquaintance, and
dined with him at his house. Sir John Hawkins, indeed, gives full vent
to his own prejudice in abusing Blackfriars bridge, calling it 'an
edifice, in which beauty and symmetry are in vain sought for; by which
the citizens of London have perpetuated study their own disgrace, and
subjected a whole nation to the reproach of foreigners.' Whoever has
contemplated, _placido lumine_ [Horace, _Odes_, iv. 3, 2], this stately,
elegant, and airy structure, which has so fine an effect, especially on
approaching the capital on that quarter, must wonder at such unjust and
ill-tempered censure; and I appeal to all foreigners of good taste,
whether this bridge be not one of the most distinguished ornaments of
London. As to the stability of the fabrick, it is certain that the City
of London took every precaution to have the best Portland stone for it;
but as this is to be found in the quarries belonging to the publick,
under the direction of the Lords of the Treasury, it so happened that
parliamentary interest, which is often the bane of fair pursuits,
thwarted their endeavours. Notwithstanding this disadvantage, it is well
known that not only has Blackfriars-bridge never sunk either in its
foundation or in its arches, which were so much the subject of contest,
but any injuries which it has suffered from the effects of severe frosts
have been already, in some measure, repaired with sounder stone, and
every necessary renewal can be completed at a moderate expence. BOSWELL.
Horace Walpole mentions an ineffectual application made by the City to
Parliament in 1764 'for more money for their new bridge at Blackfriars,'
when Dr. Hay, one of the Lords of the Admiralty, 'abused the Common
Council, whose late behaviour, he said, entitled them to no favour.'
Walpole's _Memoirs of the Reign of George III_, i. 390. The late
behaviour was the part taken by the City in Wilkes's case. It was the
same love of liberty no doubt that lost the City the Portland stone.
Smollett goes out of the way to praise his brother-Scot, Mr. Mylne, in
_Humphry Clinker_--'a party novel written,' says Horace Walpole, 'to
vindicate the Scots' (_Reign of George III_, iv. 328). In the letter
dated May 29, he makes Mr. Bramble say:--'The Bridge at Blackfriars is a
noble monument of taste and public spirit--I wonder how they stumbled
upon a work of such magnificence and utility.'

[1051] Juvenal, _Sat_. i. 85.

[1052] 'Born and educated in this country, I glory in the name of
Briton.'--George III's first speech to his parliament. It appears from
the _Hardwicke Papers_, writes the editor of the _Parl. Hist. (xv. 982),
that after the draft of the speech had been settled by the cabinet,
these words and those that came next were added by the King's own hand.
Wilkes in his _Dedication of Mortimer_ (see _post_, May 15, 1776)
asserted that 'these endearing words, "Born,&c.," were permitted to be
seen in the royal orthography of Britain for Briton,' Almon's
_Works_, i. 84.

[1053] In this _Introduction_ (_Works_, vi. 148) Johnson answers
objections that had been raised against the relief. 'We know that for
the prisoners of war there is no legal provision; we see their distress
and are certain of its cause; we know that they are poor and naked, and
poor and naked without a crime.... The opponents of this charity must
allow it to be good, and will not easily prove it not to be the best.
That charity is best of which the consequences are most extensive; the
relief of enemies has a tendency to unite mankind in fraternal
affection.' The Committee for which Johnson's paper was written began
its work in Dec. 1759. In the previous month of October Wesley records
in his _Journal (ii. 461):--'I walked up to Knowle, a mile from Bristol,
to see the French prisoners. Above eleven hundred of them, we were
informed, were confined in that little place, without anything to lie on
but a little dirty straw, or anything to cover them but a few foul thin
rags, either by day or by night, so that they died like rotten sheep. I
was much affected, and preached in the evening on _Exodus_ xxiii. 9.'
Money was at once contributed, and clothing bought. 'It was not long
before contributions were set on foot in various parts of the Kingdom.'
On Oct. 24 of the following year, he records:--'I visited the French
prisoners at Knowle, and found many of them almost naked again.' _Ib_.
iii. 23. 'The prisoners,' wrote Hume (_Private Corres_. p. 55),
'received food from the public, but it was thought that their own
friends would supply them with clothes, which, however, was found after
some time to be neglected.' The cry arose that the brave and gallant
men, though enemies, were perishing with cold in prison; a subscription
was set on foot; great sums were given by all ranks of people; and,
notwithstanding the national foolish prejudices against the French, a
remarkable zeal everywhere appeared for this charity. I am afraid that
M. Rousseau could not have produced many parallel instances among his
heroes, the Greeks; and still fewer among the Romans. Baretti, in his
_Journey from London to Genoa_ (i. 62, 66), after telling how on all
foreigners, even on a Turk wearing a turban, 'the pretty appellation of
_French dog_ was liberally bestowed by the London rabble,'
continues:--'I have seen the populace of England contribute as many
shillings as they could spare towards the maintenance of the French
prisoners; and I have heard a universal shout of joy when their
parliament voted £100,000 to the Portuguese on hearing of the tremendous
earthquake.'

[1054] Johnson's _Works_, vi. 81. See Boswell's _Hebrides_, Aug. 16,
1773, where Johnson describes Mary as 'such a Queen as every man of any
gallantry of spirit would have sacrificed his life for.' 'There are,'
wrote Hume, 'three events in our history which may be regarded as
touchstones of party-men. An English Whig who asserts the reality of the
popish plot, an Irish Catholic who denies the massacre in 1641, and a
Scotch Jacobite who maintains the innocence of Queen Mary, must be
considered as men beyond the reach of argument or reason, and must be
left to their prejudices.' _History of England_, ed. 1802, v. 504.

entry on this day:--

To combat notions of obligation.
To apply to study.
To reclaim imagination.
To consult the resolves on Tetty's coffin.
To rise early.

[1057] Mr. Croker points out that Murphy's _Epistle_ was an imitation of
Boileau's _Epître à Molière_.

[1058] The paper mentioned in the text is No. 38 of the second series of
the _Grays Inn Journal_, published on June 15, 1754; which is a
translation from the French version of Johnson's _Rambler_, No. 190.
MALONE. Mrs. Piozzi relates how Murphy, used to tell before Johnson of
the first time they met. He found our friend all covered with soot, like
a chimney-sweeper, in a little room, with an intolerable heat and
strange smell, as if he had been acting Lungs in the _Alchymist_, making
aether. 'Come, come,' says Dr. Johnson, 'dear Murphy, the story is black
enough now; and it was a very happy day for me that brought you first to
my house, and a very happy mistake about the Ramblers.' Piozzi's _Anec_.
p. 235. Murphy quotes her account, Murphy's _Johnson_, p. 79. See also
_post_, 1770, where Dr. Maxwell records in his _Collectanea_ how Johnson
'very much loved Arthur Murphy.' Miss Burney thus describes him:--'He is
tall and well-made, has a very gentlemanlike appearance, and a quietness
of manner upon his first address that to me is very pleasing. His face
looks sensible, and his deportment is perfectly easy and polite.' A few
days later she records:--'Mr. Murphy was the life of the party; he was
in good spirits, and extremely entertaining; he told a million of
stories admirably well.' Mme. D'Arblay's _Diary_, i. 195, 210. Rogers,
who knew Murphy well, says that 'towards the close of his life, till he
received a pension of £200 from the King, he was in great pecuniary
difficulties. He had eaten himself out of every tavern from the other
side of Temple-Bar to the west end of the town.' He owed Rogers a large
sum of money, which he never repaid. 'He assigned over to me the whole
of his works; and I soon found that he had already disposed of them to a
bookseller. One thing,' Rogers continues, 'ought to be remembered to his
honour; an actress with whom he had lived bequeathed to him all her
property, but he gave up every farthing of it to her relations.' He was
pensioned in 1803, and he died in 1805. Rogers's _Table-Talk_, p. 106.

[1061] Thomas Sheridan, born 1721, died 1788. He was the son of Swift's
friend, and the father of R. B. Sheridan (who was born in 1751), and the
great-great-grandfather of the present Earl of Dufferin.

[1062] Sheridan was acting in Garrick's Company, generally on the nights
on which Garrick did not appear. Davies's _Garrick_, i. 299. Johnson
criticises his reading, _post_, April 18, 1783.

novel of great merit, and of some other pieces.--See her character,

[1065] See _post_, April 6, 1775.

[1066] I have had inquiry made in Ireland as to this story, but do not
find it recollected there. I give it on the authority of Dr. Johnson, to
which may be added that of the _biographical Dictionary_, and
_Biographia Dramatica_; in both of which it has stood many years. Mr.
Malone observes, that the truth probably is, not that an edition was
published with Rolt's name in the title-page, but, that the poem being
then anonymous, Rolt acquiesced in its being attributed to him in
conversation. BOSWELL.

[1067] I have both the books. Innes was the clergyman who brought
Psalmanazar to England, and was an accomplice in his extraordinary
fiction. BOSWELL. It was in 1728 that Innes, who was a Doctor of
Divinity and Preacher-Assistant at St. Margaret's Westminster, published
this book. In his impudent Dedication to Lord Chancellor King he says
that 'were matters once brought to the melancholy pass that mankind
should become proselytes to such impious delusions' as Mandeville
taught, 'punishments must be annexed to virtue and rewards to vice.' It
was not till 1730 that Dr. Campbell 'laid open this imposture.' Preface,
p. xxxi. Though he was Professor of Ecclesiastical History in St.
Andrews, yet he had not, it should seem, heard of the fraud till then:
so remote was Scotland from London in those days. It was not till 1733
that he published his own edition. For Psalmanazar, see _post_,
April 18, 1778.

[1068] 'Died, the Rev. Mr. Eccles, at Bath. In attempting to save a boy,
whom he saw sinking in the Avon, he, together with the youth, were both
drowned.' _Gent. Mag_. Aug. 15, 1777. And in the magazine for the next
month are some verses on this event, with an epitaph, of which the
first line is,

'Beneath this stone the "_Man of
      Feeling_" lies.'

CROKER.

[1069] 'Harry Mackenzie,' wrote Scott in 1814, 'never put his name in a
title page till the last edition of his works.' Lockhart's _Scott_, iv.
178. He wrote also _The Man of the World_, which Johnson 'looked at, but
thought there was nothing in it.' Boswell's _Hebrides_, Oct. 2, 1773.
Scott, however, called it 'a very pathetic tale.' Croker's _Boswell, p.
359. Burns, writing of his twenty-third year, says: '_Tristram Shandy_
and the _Man of Feeling_ were my bosom favourites.' Currie's _Life of
Burns_, ed.1846. p. 21.

[1070] From the Prologue to Dryden's adaptation of _The Tempest_.

[1071] The originals of Dr. Johnson's three letters to Mr. baretti,
which are among the very best he ever wrote, were communicated to the
elegant monthly miscellany, _The European Magazine_, in which they first
appeared. BOSWELL.

[1072] Baretti left London for Lisbon on Aug. 14, 1760. He went through
Portugal, Spain, and France to Antibes, whence he went by sea to Genoa,
where he arrived on Nov. 18. In 1770 he published a lively account of
his travels under the title of _A Journey from London to Genoa_.

[1073] Malone says of Baretti that 'he was certainly a man of
extraordinary talents, and perhaps no one ever made himself so
completely master of a foreign language as he did of English.' Prior's
_Malone_, p. 392. Mrs. Piozzi gives the following 'instance of his skill
in our low street language. Walking in a field near Chelsea he met a
fellow, who, suspecting him from dress and manner to be a foreigner,
said sneeringly, "Come, Sir, will you show me the way to France?" "No,
Sir," says Baretti instantly, "but I will show you the way to Tyburn."'
He travelled with her in France. 'Oh how he would court the maids at the
inns abroad, abuse the men perhaps, and that with a facility not to be
exceeded, as they all confessed, by any of the natives. But so he could
in Spain, I find.' Hayward's _Piozzi_, ii. 347.

[1074] Johnson was intimate with Lord Southwell, _ante_, p. 243. It
seems unlikely that Baretti merely conducted Mr. Southwell from Turin to
Venice; yet there is not a line in his _Journey_ to show that any
Englishman accompanied him from London to Turin.

[1075] See _ante_, p. 350, note.

[1076] The first of these annual exhibitions was opened on April 21,
1760, at the Room of the Society of Arts, in the Strand. 'As a
consequence of their success, grew the incorporation of a Society of
Artists in 1765, by seccession from which finally was constituted the
Royal Academy [In Dec. 1768].' Taylor's _Reynolds_, i. 179. For the
third exhibition Johnson wrote the Preface to the catalogue. In this,
speaking for the Committee of the Artists he says:--'The purpose of this
Exhibition is not to enrich the artist, but to advance the art; the
eminent are not flattered with preference, nor the obscure insulted with
contempt; whoever hopes to deserve public favour is here invited to
display his merit.' Northcote's _Reynolds_, i. 101.

[1077] Hawkins (_Life_, p. 318) says that Johnson told him 'that in his
whole life he was never capable of discerning the least resemblance of
any kind between a picture and the subject it was intended to
represent.' This, however must have been an exaggeration on the part
either of Hawkins or Johnson. His general ignorance of art is shown by
Mrs. Piozzi (_Anec_., p. 98):--'Sir Joshua Reynolds mentioned some
picture as excellent. "It has often grieved me, sir," said Mr. Johnson,
"to see so much mind as the science of painting requires, laid out upon
such perishable materials: why do not you oftener make use of copper? I
could wish your superiority in the art you profess to be preserved in
stuff more durable than canvas." Sir Joshua urged the difficulty of
procuring a plate large enough for historical subjects. "What foppish
obstacles are these!" exclaims on a sudden Dr. Johnson. "Here is Thrale
has a thousand tun of copper; you may paint it all round if you will, I
suppose; it will serve him to brew in afterwards. Will it not, Sir?" to
my husband who sat by. Indeed his utter scorn of painting was such, that
I have heard him say, that he should sit very quietly in a room hung
round with the works of the greatest masters, and never feel the
slightest disposition to turn them, if their backs were outermost,
unless it might be for the sake of telling Sir Joshua that he _had_
turned them.' Such a remark of Johnson's must not, however, be taken too
strictly. He often spoke at random, often with exaggeration. 'There is
in many minds a kind of vanity exerted to the disadvantage of
themselves.' This reflection of his is the opening sentence to the
number of the Idler (No. 45) in which he thus writes about
portrait-painting:--'Genius is chiefly exerted in historical pictures;
and the art of the painter of portraits is often lost in the obscurity
of his subject. But it is in painting as in life; what is greatest is
not always best. I should grieve to see Reynolds transfer to heroes and
to goddesses, to empty splendour and to airy fiction, that art which is
now employed in diffusing friendship, in reviving tenderness, in
quickening the affections of the absent, and continuing the presence of
the dead.' It is recorded in Johnson's _Works_, (1787) xi. 208, that
'Johnson, talking with some persons about allegorical painting said, "I
had rather see the portrait of a dog that I know than all the
allegorical paintings they can show me in the world."' He bought prints
of Burke, Dyer, and Goldsmith--'Good impressions' he said to hang in a
little room that he was fitting up with prints. Croker's _Boswell_, p.
639. Among his effects that were sold after his death were 'sixty-one
portraits framed and glazed,' _post_, under Dec. 9, 1784. When he was at
Paris, and saw the picture-gallery at the Palais Royal, he entered in
his Diary:--'I thought the pictures of Raphael fine;' _post_, Oct. 16,
1775. The philosopher Hume was more insensible even than Johnson. Dr.
J.H. Burton says:--'It does not appear from any incident in his life, or
allusions in his letters, which I can remember, that he had ever really
admired a picture or a statue.' _Life of me_, ii. 134.

[1078] By Colman--'There is nothing else new,' wrote Horace Walpole on
March 7, 1761 (_Letters,_ in. 382), 'but a very indifferent play, called
_The Jealous Wife_, so well acted as to have succeeded greatly.'

[1079] In Chap. 47 of _Rasselas_ Johnson had lately considered monastic
life. Imlac says of the monks:--'Their time is regularly distributed;
one duty succeeds another, so that they are not left open to the
distraction of unguided choice, nor lost in the shades of listless
inactivity.... He that lives well in the world is better than he that
lives well in a monastery. But perhaps every one is not able to stem the
temptations of publick life; and, if he cannot conquer, he may properly
retreat.' See also _post_, March 15, 1776, and Boswell's _Hebrides_,
Aug. 19, 1773.

[1080] Baretti, in the preface to his _Journey_ (p. vi.), says that the
method of the book was due to Dr. Johnson. 'It was he that exhorted me
to write daily, and with all possible minuteness; it was he that pointed
out the topics which would most interest and most delight in a future
publication.'

[1081] He advised Boswell to go to Spain. _Post_, June 25 and July 26,
1763.

[1082] Dr. Percy records that 'the first visit Goldsmith ever received
from Johnson was on May 31, 1761, [ten days before this letter was
written] when he gave an invitation to him, and much other company, many
of them literary men, to a supper in his lodgings in Wine Office Court,
Fleet Street. Percy being intimate with Johnson, was desired to call
upon him and take him with him. As they went together the former was
much struck with the studied neatness of Johnson's dress. He had on a
new suit of clothes, a new wig nicely powdered, and everything about him
so perfectly dissimilar from his usual appearance that his companion
could not help inquiring the cause of this singular transformation.
"Why, Sir," said Johnson, "I hear that Goldsmith, who is a very great
sloven, justifies his disregard of cleanliness and decency by quoting my
practice, and I am desirous this night to show him a better example."'

[1086] Boswell is ten years out in his date. This work was published in
1752. The review of it in the _Gent. Mag_. for that year, p. 146, was, I
believe, by Johnson.

[1087] He accompanied Lord Macartney on his embassy to China in 1792. In
1797 he published his _Account of the Embassy_.

[1088] It was taken in 1759, and restored to France in 1763. _Penny
Cyclo_. xi. 463.

[1089] W. S. Landor (_Works_, ed. 1876, v. 99) says:--'Extraordinary as
were Johnson's intellectual powers, he knew about as much of poetry as
of geography. In one of his letters he talks of Guadaloupe as being in
another hemisphere. Speaking of that island, his very words are these:
"Whether you return hither or stay in another hemisphere."' Guadaloupe,
being in the West Indies, is in another hemisphere.

[1090] See _post_, April 12, 1776.

[1091] 'It is necessary to hope, though hope should always be deluded;
for hope itself is happiness, and its frustrations, however frequent,
are less dreadful than its extinction.' _The Idler_, No. 58. See also
_post_, under March 30, 1783, where he ranks the situation of the Prince
of Wales as the happiest in the kingdom, partly on account of the
enjoyment of hope.

[1092] Though Johnson wrote this same day to Lord Bute to thank him for
his pension, he makes no mention to Baretti of this accession to
his fortune.

[1093] See _ante_, p. 245. Mrs. Porter, the actress, lived some time
with Mrs. Cotterel and her eldest daughter. CROKER.

[1094] Miss Charlotte Cotterel, married to Dean Lewis. See _post_, Dec.
21, 1762.

[1095] Reynolds's note-book shows that this year he had close on 150
sitters. Taylor's _Reynolds_, i. 218.

[1096] He married a woman of the town, who had persuaded him
(notwithstanding their place of congress was a small coalshed in Fetter
Lane) that she was nearly related to a man of fortune, but was
injuriously kept by him out of large possessions. She regarded him as a
physician already in considerable practice. He had not been married four
months, before a writ was taken out against him for debts incurred by
his wife. He was secreted; and his friend then procured him a protection
from a foreign minister. In a short time afterwards she ran away from
him, and was tried (providentially in his opinion) for picking pockets
at the Old Bailey. Her husband was with difficulty prevented from
attending the Court, in the hope she would be hanged. She pleaded her
own cause and was acquitted. A separation between them took place.'
_Gent. Mag_. lv. 101.

[1097] Richardson had died more than a year earlier,--on July 4, 1761.
That Johnson should think it needful at the date of his letter to inform
Baretti of the death of so famous a writer shows how slight was the
communication between London and Milan. Nay, he repeats the news in his
letter of Dec. 21, 1762.

[1098] On Dec. 8, 1765, he wrote to Hector:--'A few years ago I just
saluted Birmingham, but had no time to see any friend, for I came in
after midnight with a friend, and went away in the morning.' _Notes and
Queries_, 6th S. iii. 321. He passed through Birmingham, I conjecture,
on his visit to Lichfield.

[1099] Writing to Mrs. Thrale from Lichfield on July 20, 1767, he
says:--'Miss Lucy [Porter, his step-daughter, not his daughter-in-law,
as he calls her above] is more kind and civil than I expected, and has
raised my esteem by many excellencies very noble and resplendent, though
a little discoloured by hoary virginity. Everything else recalls to my
remembrance years, in which I proposed what I am afraid I have not done,
and promised myself pleasure which I have not found.' _Piozzi
Letters_, i. 4.

[1100] In his _Journey into Wales_ (Aug. 24, 1774), he describes how
Mrs. Thrale visited one of the scenes of her youth. 'She remembered the
rooms, and wandered over them with recollection of her childhood. This
species of pleasure is always melancholy. The walk was cut down and the
pond was dry. Nothing was better.'

[1101] This is a very just account of the relief which London affords to
melancholy minds. BOSWELL.

[1102] To Devonshire.

[1103] See _ante_, p. 322.

[1104] Dr. T. Campbell (_Diary of a visit to England_, p. 32) recorded
on March 16, 1775, that 'Baretti said that now he could not live out of
London. He had returned a few years ago to his own country, but he could
not enjoy it; and he was obliged to return to London to those
connections he had been making for near thirty years past.' Baretti had
come to England in 1750 (_ante_, p. 302), so that thirty years is an
exaggeration.

[1105] How great a sum this must have been in Johnson's eyes is shown by
a passage in his _Life of Savage_ (_Works_, viii. 125). Savage, he says,
was received into Lord Tyrconnel's family and allowed a pension of £200
a year. 'His presence,' Johnson writes, 'was sufficient to make any
place of publick entertainment popular; and his approbation and example
constituted the fashion. So powerful is genius when it is invested with
the glitter of affluence!' In the last summer of his life, speaking of
the chance of his pension being doubled, he said that with six hundred a
year 'a man would have the consciousness that he should pass the
remainder of his life _in splendour_, how long soever it might be.'
_Post_, June 30, 1784. David Hume writing in 1751, says:--'I have £50 a
year, a £100 worth of books, great store of linens and fine clothes, and
near £100 in my pocket; along with order, frugality, a strong spirit of
independency, good health, a contented humour, and an unabating love of
study. In these circumstances I must esteem myself one of the happy and
fortunate.' J. H. Burton's _Hume_, i. 342. Goldsmith, in his _Present
State of Polite Learning_ (chap, vii), makes the following observation
on pensions granted in France to authors:--'The French nobility have
certainly a most pleasing way of satisfying the vanity of an author
without indulging his avarice. A man of literary merit is sure of being
caressed by the great, though seldom enriched. His pension from the
crown just supplies half a competence, and the sale of his labours makes
some small addition to his circumstances; thus the author leads a life
of splendid poverty, and seldom becomes wealthy or indolent enough to
discontinue an exertion of those abilities by which he rose.' Whether
Johnson's pension led to his writing less than he would otherwise have
done may be questioned. It is true that in the next seventeen years he
did little more than finish his edition of _Shakespeare_, and write his
_Journey to the Western Islands_ and two or three political pamphlets.
But since he wrote the last number of _The Idler_ in the spring of 1760
he had done very little. His mind, which, to use Murphy's words (_Life_,
p. 80), had been 'strained and overlaboured by constant exertion,' had
not recovered its tone. It is likely, that without the pension he would
not have lived to write the second greatest of his works--the _Lives of
the Poets_.

[1106] Mr. Forster (_Life of Goldsmith_, i. 281) says:--'Bute's pensions
to his Scottish crew showing meaner than ever in Churchill's daring
verse, it occurred to the shrewd and wary Wedderburne to advise, for a
set off, that Samuel Johnson should be pensioned.' _The Prophecy of
Famine_ in which Churchill's attack was made on the pensioned Scots was
published in Jan. 1763, nearly half a year after Johnson's pension was
conferred.

[1107] For his _Falkland's Islands_ 'materials were furnished to him by
the ministry' (_post_, 1771). '_The Patriot_ was called for,' he writes,
'by my political friends' (_post_, Nov. 26, 1774). 'That _Taxation no
Tyranny_ was written at the desire of those who were then in power, I
have no doubt,' writes Boswell (_post_, under March 21, 1775). 'Johnson
complained to a friend that, his pension having been given to him as a
literary character, he had been applied to by administration to write
political pamphlets' (_Ib_.). Are these statements inconsistent with
what Lord Loughborough said, and with Boswell's assertion (_Ib_.) that
'Johnson neither asked nor received from government any reward
whatsoever for his political labours?' I think not. I think that, had
Johnson unpensioned been asked by the Ministry to write these pamphlets,
he would have written them. He would have been pleased by the
compliment, and for pay would have trusted to the sale. Speaking of the
first two of these pamphlets--the third had not yet appeared--he said,
'Except what I had from the booksellers, I did not get a farthing by
them' (_post_, March 21, 1772). They had not cost him much labour. _The
False Alarm_ was written between eight o'clock of one night and twelve
o'clock of the next. It went through three editions in less than two
months (_post_, 1770). _The Patriot_ was written on a Saturday (_post_,
Nov. 26, 1774). At all events Johnson had received his pension for more
than seven years before he did any work for the ministry. In Croft's
_Life of Young_, which Johnson adopted (_Works_, viii. 422), the
following passage was perhaps intended to be a defence of Johnson as a
writer for the Ministry:--'Yet who shall say with certainty that Young
was a pensioner? In all modern periods of this country, have not the
writers on one side been regularly called hirelings, and on the other
patriots?'

[1108] See _ante_, p. 294.

[1109] Murphy's account is nearly as follows (_Life_, p. 92):--'Lord
Loughborough was well acquainted with Johnson; but having heard much of
his independent spirit, and of the downfall of Osborne the bookseller
(_ante_, p. 154), he did not know but his benevolence might be rewarded
with a folio on his head. He desired me to undertake the task. I went to
the chambers in the Inner Temple Lane, which, in fact, were the abode of
wretchedness. By slow and studied approaches the message was disclosed.
Johnson made a long pause; he asked if it was seriously intended. He
fell into a profound meditation, and his own definition of a pensioner
occurred to him. He desired to meet next day, and dine at the Mitre
Tavern. At that meeting he gave up all his scruples. On the following
day Lord Loughborough conducted him to the Earl of Bute. The
conversation that passed was in the evening related to me by Dr.
Johnson. He expressed his sense of his Majesty's bounty, and thought
himself the more highly honoured, as the favour was not bestowed on him
for having dipped his pen in faction. "No, Sir," said Lord Bute, "it is
not offered to you for having dipped your pen in faction, nor with a
design that you ever should."' The reviewer of Hawkins's _Johnson_ in
the _Monthly Review_, lxxvi. 375, who was, no doubt, Murphy, adds a
little circumstance:--'On the next day Mr. Murphy was in the Temple Lane
soon after nine; _he got Johnson up and dressed in due time_; and saw
him set off at eleven.' Malone's note on what Lord Bute said to Johnson
is as follows:--'This was said by Lord Bute, as Dr. Burney was informed
by Johnson himself, in answer to a question which he put, previously to
his acceptance of the intended bounty: "Pray, my Lord, what am I
expected to do for this pension?"'

[1110]

'In Britain's senate he a seat obtains
And one more pensioner St. Stephen gains.'

_Moral Essays_, iii. 392.

Johnson left the definition of _pension_ and _pensioner_ unchanged in
the fourth edition of the _Dictionary_, corrected by him in 1773.

[1111] He died on March 10, 1792. This paragraph and the letter are not
in the first two editions.

[1112] The Treasury, Home Office, Exchequer of Receipt and Audit Office
Records have been searched for a warrant granting a pension to Dr.
Johnson without success. In 1782, by Act of Parliament all pensions on
the Civil List Establishment were from that time to be paid at the
Exchequer. In the Exchequer Order Book, Michaelmas 1782, No. 46, p. 74,
the following memorandum occurs:--"Memdum. 3 Dec. 1782. There was issued
to the following persons (By order 6th of Nov. 1782) the sums set
against their names respectively, etc.:--Persons names: Johnson Saml,
LL.D. Pensions p. ann. £300. Due to 5 July 1782, two quarters, £150."

This pension was paid at the Exchequer from that time to the quarter
ending 10 Oct. 1784. 'It is clear that the pension was payable quarterly
[for confirmation of this, see _post_, Nov. 3, 1762, and July 16, 1765]
and at the old quarter days, July 5, Oct. 10, Jan. 5, April 5, though
payment was sometimes delayed. [Once he was paid half-yearly; see
_post_, under March 20, 1771.] The expression "bills" was a general term
at the time for notes, cheques, and warrants, and no doubt covered some
kind of Treasury warrant.' The above information I owe to the kindness
of my friend Mr. Leonard H. Courtney, M.P., late Financial Secretary to
the Treasury. The 'future favours' are the future payments. His pension
was not for life, and depended therefore entirely on the king's pleasure
(see _post_, under March 21, 1775). The following letter in the
_Grenville Papers_, ii. 68, seems to show that Johnson thought the
pension due on the _new_ quarter-day:--

'DR. JOHNSON To MR. GRENVILLE.

'July 2, 1763.

'SIR,

'Be pleased to pay to the bearer seventy-five pounds, being the
quarterly payment of a pension granted by his Majesty, and due on the
24th day of June last, to Sir,

'Your most humble servant,

'SAM. JOHNSON.'

[1113] They left London on Aug. 16 and returned to it on Sept. 26.
Taylor's _Reynolds_, i. 214. Northcote records of this visit:--'I
remember when Mr. Reynolds was pointed out to me at a public meeting,
where a great crowd was assembled, I got as near to him as I could from
the pressure of the people to touch the skirt of his coat, which I did
with great satisfaction to my mind.' Northcote's _Reynolds_, i. 116. In
like manner Reynolds, when a youth, had in a great crowd touched the
hand of Pope. _Ib_, p. 19. Pope, when a boy of eleven, 'persuaded some
friends to take him to the coffee-house which Dryden frequented.'
Johnson's _Works_, viii. 236. Who touched old Northcote's hand? Has the
apostolic succession been continued?--Since writing these lines I have
read with pleasure the following passage in Mr. Ruskin's _Praeterita_,
chapter i. p. 16:--'When at three-and-a-half I was taken to have my
portrait painted by Mr. Northcote, I had not been ten minutes alone with
him before I asked him why there were holes in his carpet.' Dryden,
Pope, Reynolds, Northcote, Ruskin, so runs the chain of genius, with
only one weak link in it.

[1114] At one of these seats Dr. Amyat, Physician in London, told me he
happened to meet him. In order to amuse him till dinner should be ready,
he was taken out to walk in the garden. The master of the house,
thinking it proper to introduce something scientifick into the
conversation, addressed him thus: 'Are you a botanist, Dr. Johnson:'
'No, Sir, (answered Johnson,) I am not a botanist; and, (alluding no
doubt, to his near sightedness) should I wish to become a botanist, I
must first turn myself into a reptile.' BOSWELL.

[1115] Mrs. Piozzi (_Anec_. 285) says:--'The roughness of the language
used on board a man of war, where he passed a week on a visit to Captain
Knight, disgusted him terribly. He asked an officer what some place was
called, and received for answer that it was where the loplolly man kept
his loplolly; a reply he considered as disrespectful, gross and
ignorant.' Mr. Croker says that Captain Knight of the _Belleisle_ lay
for a couple of months in 1762 in Plymouth Sound. Croker's _Boswell_, p.
480. It seems unlikely that Johnson passed a whole week on ship-board.
_Loplolly_, or _Loblolly_, is explained in _Roderick Random_, chap.
xxvii. Roderick, when acting as the surgeon's assistant on a man of war,
'suffered,' he says, 'from the rude insults of the sailors and petty
officers, among whom I was known by the name of _Lobolly Boy_.'

[1116] He was the father of Colonel William Mudge, distinguished by his
trigonometrical survey of England and Wales. WRIGHT.

[1117] 'I have myself heard Reynolds declare, that the elder Mr. Mudge
was, in his opinion, the wisest man he had ever met with in his life. He
has always told me that he owed his first disposition to generalise, and
to view things in the abstract, to him.' Northcote's _Reynolds_, i.
112, 115.

[1118] See _post_, under March 20, 1781.

[1119] See _ante_, p. 293. BOSWELL.

[1120] The present Devonport.

[1121] A friend of mine once heard him, during this visit, exclaim with
the utmost vehemence 'I _hate_ a Docker.' BLAKEWAY. Northcote (Life of
Reynolds, i. 118) says that Reynolds took Johnson to dine at a house
where 'he devoured so large a quantity of new honey and of clouted
cream, besides drinking large potations of new cyder, that the
entertainer found himself much embarrassed between his anxious regard
for the Doctor's health and his fear of breaking through the rules of
politeness, by giving him a hint on the subject. The strength of
Johnson's constitution, however, saved him from any unpleasant
consequences.' 'Sir Joshua informed a friend that he had never seen Dr.
Johnson intoxicated by hard drinking but once, and that happened at the
time that they were together in Devonshire, when one night after supper
Johnson drank three bottles of wine, which affected his speech so much
that he was unable to articulate a hard word, which occurred in the
course of his conversation. He attempted it three times but failed; yet
at last accomplished it, and then said, "Well, Sir Joshua, I think it is
now time to go to bed."' _Ib_. ii. 161. One part of this story however
is wanting in accuracy, and therefore all may be untrue. Reynolds at
this time was not knighted. Johnson said (_post_, April 7, 1778): 'I did
not leave off wine because I could not bear it; I have drunk three
bottles of port without being the worse for it. University College has
witnessed this.' See however _post_, April 24, 1779, where he said:--'I
used to slink home when I had drunk too much;' also _ante_, p. 103, and
_post_, April 28, 1783.

[1122] George Selwyn wrote:--'Topham Beauclerk is arrived. I hear he
lost £10,000 to a thief at Venice, which thief, in the course of the
year, will be at Cashiobury.' (The reference to this quotation I
have mislaid.)

[1123] Two years later he repeated this thought in the lines that he
added to Goldsmith's _Traveller_. _Post_, under Feb. 1766.

[1124] We may compare with this what 'old Bentley' said:--'Depend upon
it, no man was ever written down but by himself.' Boswell's _Hebrides_,
Oct. 1, 1773.

[1125] The preliminaries of peace between England and France had been
signed on Nov. 3 of this year. _Ann Reg_. v. 246.

[1126] Of Baretti's _Travels through Spain, &c_., Johnson wrote to Mrs.
Thrale:--'That Baretti's book would please you all I made no doubt. I
know not whether the world has ever seen such _Travels_ before. Those
whose lot it is to ramble can seldom write, and those who know how to
write very seldom ramble.' _Piozzi_ Letters, i. 32.

[1127] See _ante_, p. 370.

[1128] See _ante_, p. 242, note 1.

[1129] Huggins had quarrelled with Johnson and Baretti (Croker's
_Boswell_, 129, note). See also _post_, 1780, in Mr. Langton's
_Collection_.

[1130] See _ante_, p. 370.

[1131] Cowper, writing in 1784 about Collins, says:--'Of whom I did not
know that he existed till I found him there'--in the _Lives of the
Poets_, that is to say. Southey's _Cowper_, v. II.

[1132] To this passage Johnson, nearly twenty years later, added the
following (_Works_, viii. 403):--'Such was the fate of Collins, with
whom I once delighted to converse, and whom I yet remember with
tenderness.'

[1133] 'MADAM. To approach the high and the illustrious has been in all
ages the privilege of Poets; and though translators cannot justly claim
the same honour, yet they naturally follow their authours as attendants;
and I hope that in return for having enabled TASSO to diffuse his fame
through the British dominions, I may be introduced by him to the
presence of YOUR MAJESTY.

TASSO has a peculiar claim to YOUR MAJESTY'S favour, as follower and
panegyrist of the House of _Este_, which has one common ancestor with
the House of HANOVER; and in reviewing his life it is not easy to
forbear a wish that he had lived in a happier time, when he might, among
the descendants of that illustrious family, have found a more liberal
and potent patronage.

I cannot but observe, MADAM, how unequally reward is proportioned to
merit, when I reflect that the happiness which was withheld from TASSO
is reserved for me; and that the poem which once hardly procured to its
authour the countenance of the Princess of Ferrara, has attracted to its
translator the favourable notice of a BRITISH QUEEN.

Had this been the fate of TASSO, he would have been able to have
celebrated the condescension of YOUR MAJESTY in nobler language, but
could not have felt it with more ardent gratitude, than MADAM, Your
MAJESTY'S Most faithful and devoted servant.'--BOSWELL.

[1134] Young though Boswell was, he had already tried his hand at more
than one kind of writing. In 1761 he had published anonymously an _Elegy
on the Death of an Amiable Young Lady_, with an _Epistle from Menalcas
to Lycidas_. (Edinburgh, Donaldson.) The Elegy is full of such errors as
'Thou liv'd,' 'Thou led,' but is recommended by a puffing preface and
three letters--one of which is signed J--B. About the same time he
brought out a piece that was even more impudent. It was _An Ode to
Tragedy_. By a gentleman of Scotland. (Edinburgh, Donaldson, 1761. Price
sixpence.) In the 'Dedication to James Boswell, Esq.,' he says:--'I have
no intention to pay you compliments--To entertain agreeable notions of
one's own character is a great incentive to act with propriety and
spirit. But I should be sorry to contribute in any degree to your
acquiring an excess of self-sufficiency ... I own indeed that when ...
to display my extensive erudition, I have quoted Greek, Latin and French
sentences one after another with astonishing celerity; or have got into
my _Old-hock humour_ and fallen a-raving about princes and lords,
knights and geniuses, ladies of quality and harpsichords; you, with a
peculiar comic smile, have gently reminded me of the _importance of a
man to himself_, and slily left the room with the witty Dean lying open
at--P.P. _clerk of this parish_. [Swift's _Works_, ed. 1803, xxiii.
142.] I, Sir, who enjoy the pleasure of your intimate acquaintance, know
that many of your hours of retirement are devoted to thought.' The _Ode_
is serious. He describes himself as having

'A soul by nature formed to feel Grief sharper than the tyrant's steel,
And bosom big with swelling thought From ancient lore's
remembrance brought.'

In the winter of 1761-2 he had helped as a contributor and part-editor
in bringing out a _Collection of Original Poems_. (_Boswell and
Erskine's Letters_, p. 27.) His next publication, also anonymous, was
_The Club at Newmarket_, written, as the Preface says, 'in the Newmarket
Coffee Room, in which the author, being elected a member of the Jockey
Club, had the happiness of passing several sprightly good-humoured
evenings.' It is very poor stuff. In the winter of 1762-3 he joined in
writing the _Critical Strictures_, mentioned _post_, June 25, 1763. Just
about the time that he first met Johnson he and his friend the Hon.
Andrew Erskine had published in their own names a very impudent little
volume of the correspondence that had passed between them. Of this I
published an edition with notes in 1879, together with Boswell's
_Journal of a Tour to Corsica_. (Messrs. Thos. De La Rue & Co.).

[1135] Boswell, in 1768, in the preface to the third edition of his
_Corsica_ described 'the warmth of affection and the dignity of
veneration' with which he never ceased to think of Mr. Johnson.

[1136] In the _Garrick Carres_, (ii. 83) there is a confused letter from
this unfortunate man, asking Garrick for the loan of five guineas. He
had a scheme for delivering dramatic lectures at Eton and Oxford; 'but,'
he added, 'my externals have so unfavourable an appearance that I cannot
produce myself with any comfort or hope of success.' Garrick sent him
five guineas. He had been a Major in the army, an actor, and dramatic
author. 'For the last seven years of his life he struggled under
sickness and want to a degree of uncommon misery.' _Gent. Mag_. for
1784, p. 959.

[1137] As great men of antiquity such as Scipio _Africanus_ had an
epithet added to their names, in consequence of some celebrated action,
so my illustrious friend was often called _DICTIONARY JOHNSON_, from
that wonderful atchievement of genius and labour, his _Dictionary of the
English Language_; the merit of which I contemplate with more and more
admiration. BOSWELL. In like manner we have 'Hermes Harris,' 'Pliny
Melmoth,' 'Demosthenes Taylor,' 'Persian Jones,' 'Abyssinian Bruce,'
'Microscope Baker,' 'Leonidas Glover,' 'Hesiod Cooke,' and
'Corsica Boswell.'

[1138] See _ante_, p. 124. He introduced Boswell to Davies, who was 'the
immediate introducer.' _Post_, under June 18, 1783, note.

[1139] On March 2, 1754 (not 1753), the audience called for a repetition
of some lines which they applied against the government. 'Diggs, the
actor, refused by order of Sheridan, the manager, to repeat them;
Sheridan would not even appear on the stage to justify the prohibition.
In an instant the audience demolished the inside of the house, and
reduced it to a shell.' Walpole's _Reign of George II_, i. 389, and
_Gent. Mag_. xxiv. 141. Sheridan's friend, Mr. S. Whyte, says
(_Miscellanea Nova, p. 16):--'In the year 1762 Sheridan's scheme for an
_English Dictionary_ was published. That memorable year he was nominated
for a pension.' He quotes (p. 111) a letter from Mrs. Sheridan, dated
Nov. 29, 1762, in which she says:--'I suppose you must have heard that
the King has granted him a pension of 200£. a year, merely as an
encouragement to his undertaking.'

[1140] See _post_, March 28, 1776.

[1141] Horace Walpole describes Lord Bute as 'a man that had passed his
life in solitude, and was too haughty to admit to his familiarity but
half a dozen silly authors and flatterers. Sir Henry Erskine, a military
poet, Home, a tragedy-writing parson,' &c. _Mem. of the Reign of George
III_, i. 37.

'In nova fert animus mutatas dicere formas

'Of bodies changed to various forms I sing:--

See _post_ under March 30, 1783, for Lord Loughborough.

[1145] See _post_, May 17, 1783, and June 24, 1784. Sheridan was not of
a forgiving nature. For some years he would not speak to his famous son:
yet he went with his daughters to the theatre to see one of his pieces
performed. 'The son took up his station by one of the side scenes,
opposite to the box where they sat, and there continued, unobserved, to
look at them during the greater part of the night. On his return home he
burst into tears, and owned how deeply it had gone to his heart, "to
think that _there_ sat his father and his sisters before him, and yet
that he alone was not permitted to go near them."' Moore's
_Sheridan_, i. 167.

[1146] As Johnson himself said:--'Men hate more steadily than they love;
and if I have said something to hurt a man once, I shall not get the
better of this by saying many things to please him.' _Post_, Sept.
15, 1777.

[1147] P. 447. BOSWELL. 'There is another writer, at present of gigantic
fame in these days of little men, who has pretended to scratch out a
life of Swift, but so miserably executed as only to reflect back on
himself that disgrace which he meant to throw upon the character of the
Dean.' _The Life of Doctor Swift_, Swift's _Works_, ed. 1803, ii. 200.
There is a passage in the _Lives of the Poets_ (_Works_, viii. 43) in
which Johnson might be supposed playfully to have anticipated this
attack. He is giving an account of Blackmore's imaginary _Literary Club
of Lay Monks_, of which the hero was 'one Mr. Johnson.' 'The rest of the
_Lay Monks_,' he writes, 'seem to be but feeble mortals, in comparison
with the gigantick Johnson.' See also _post_, Oct. 16, 1769. Horace
Walpole (_Letters_, v. 458) spoke no less scornfully than Sheridan of
Johnson and his contemporaries. On April 27, 1773, after saying that he
should like to be intimate with Anstey (the author of the _New Bath
Guide_), or with the author of the _Heroic Epistle_, he continues:--'I
have no thirst to know the rest of my contemporaries, from the absurd
bombast of Dr. Johnson down to the silly Dr. Goldsmith; though the
latter changeling has had bright gleams of parts, and the former had
sense, till he changed it for words, and sold it for a pension. Don't
think me scornful. Recollect that I have seen Pope and lived with Gray.'

[1148] Johnson is thus mentioned by Mrs. Sheridan in a letter dated,
Blois, Nov. 16, 1743, according to the _Garrick Corres_, i. 17, but the
date is wrongly given, as the Sheridans went to Blois in 1764: 'I have
heard Johnson decry some of the prettiest pieces of writing we have in
English; yet Johnson is an honourable man--that is to say, he is a good
critic, and in other respects a man of enormous talents.'

[1149] My position has been very well illustrated by Mr. Belsham of
Bedford, in his _Essay on Dramatic Poetry_. 'The fashionable doctrine
(says he) both of moralists and criticks in these times is, that virtue
and happiness are constant concomitants; and it is regarded as a kind of
dramatick impiety to maintain that virtue should not be rewarded, nor
vice punished in the last scene of the last act of every tragedy. This
conduct in our modern poets is, however, in my opinion, extremely
injudicious; for, it labours in vain to inculcate a doctrine in theory,
which every one knows to be false in fact, _viz_. that virtue in real
life is always productive of happiness; and vice of misery. Thus
Congreve concludes the Tragedy of _The Mourning Bride_ with the
following foolish couplet:--

'For blessings ever wait on virtuous deeds,
And though a late, a sure reward succeeds.'

'When a man eminently virtuous, a Brutus, a Cato, or a Socrates, finally
sink under the pressure of accumulated misfortune, we are not only led
to entertain a more indignant hatred of vice than if he rose from his
distress, but we are inevitably induced to cherish the sublime idea that
a day of future retribution will arrive when he shall receive not merely
poetical, but real and substantial justice.' _Essays Philosophical,
Historical, and Literary_, London, 1791, vol. II. 8vo. p. 317.

This is well reasoned and well expressed. I wish, indeed, that the
ingenious authour had not thought it necessary to introduce any
_instance_ of 'a man eminently virtuous;' as he would then have avoided
mentioning such a ruffian as Brutus under that description. Mr. Belsham
discovers in his _Essays_ so much reading and thinking, and good
composition, that I regret his not having been fortunate enough to be
educated a member of our excellent national establishment. Had he not
been nursed in nonconformity, he probably would not have been tainted
with those heresies (as I sincerely, and on no slight investigation,
think them) both in religion and politicks, which, while I read, I am
sure, with candour, I cannot read without offence. BOSWELL. Boswell's
'position has been illustrated' with far greater force by Johnson. 'It
has been the boast of some swelling moralists, that every man's fortune
was in his own power, that prudence supplied the place of all other
divinities, and that happiness is the unfailing consequence of virtue.
But surely the quiver of Omnipotence is stored with arrows against which
the shield of human virtue, however adamantine it has been boasted, is
held up in vain; we do not always suffer by our crimes; we are not
always protected by our innocence.' _The Adventurer_, No. 120. See also
_Rasselas_, chap. 27.

[1150] 'Charles Fox said that Mrs. Sheridan's _Sydney Biddulph_ was the
best of all modern novels. By the by [R. B.] Sheridan used to declare
that _he_ had never read it.' Rogers's _Table-Talk_, p. 90. The editor
says, in a note on this passage:--'The incident in _The School for
Scandal_ of Sir Oliver's presenting himself to his relations in disguise
is manifestly taken by Sheridan from his mother's novel.'

[1151] No. 8.--The very place where I was fortunate enough to be
introduced to the illustrious subject of this work, deserves to be
particularly marked. I never pass by it without feeling reverence and
regret. BOSWELL.

[1152] Johnson said:--'Sir, Davies has learning enough to give credit to
a clergyman.' _Post_, 1780, in Mr. Langton's _Collection_. The spiteful
Steevens thus wrote about Davies:--'His concern ought to be with the
outside of books; but Dr. Johnson, Dr. Percy, and some others have made
such a coxcomb of him, that he is now hardy enough to open volumes, turn
over their leaves, and give his opinions of their contents. Did I ever
tell you an anecdote of him? About ten years ago I wanted the Oxford
_Homer_, and called at Davies's to ask for it, as I had seen one thrown
about his shop. Will you believe me, when I assure you he told me "he
had but one, and that he kept for _his own reading_?"' _Garrick
Corres_. i. 608.

[1153] Johnson, writing to Beattie, _post_, Aug 21, 1780, says:--'Mr.
Davies has got great success as an author, generated by the corruption
of a bookseller.' His principal works are _Memoirs of Garrick_, 1780,
and _Dramatic Miscellanies_, 1784.

[1154] Churchill, in the _Rosciad_, thus celebrated his wife and mocked
his recitation:--

'With him came mighty Davies. On my life
That Davies hath a very pretty wife:--
Statesman all over!--In plots famous grown!--
He mouths a sentence, as curs mouth a bone.'

Churchill's _Poems_, i. 16.

See _post_, under April 20, 1764, and March 20, 1778. Charles Lamb in a
note to his _Essay on the Tragedies of Shakespeare_ says of Davies, that
he 'is recorded to have recited the _Paradise Lost_ better than any man
in England in his day (though I cannot help thinking there must be some
mistake in this tradition).' Lamb's _Works_, ed. 1840, p. 517.

[1155] See Johnson's letter to Davies, _post_, June 18, 1783.

[1156] Mr. Murphy, in his _Essay on the Life and Genius of Dr. Johnson_,
[p. 106], has given an account of this meeting considerably different
from mine, I am persuaded without any consciousness of errour. His
memory, at the end of near thirty years, has undoubtedly deceived him,
and he supposes himself to have been present at a scene, which he has
probably heard inaccurately described by others. In my note _taken on
the very day_, in which I am confident I marked every thing material
that passed, no mention is made of this gentleman; and I am sure, that I
should not have omitted one so well known in the literary world. It may
easily be imagined that this, my first interview with Dr. Johnson, with
all its circumstances, made a strong impression on my mind, and would be
registered with peculiar attention. BOSWELL.

[1157] See _post_, April 8, 1775.

[1158] That this was a momentary sally against Garrick there can be no
doubt; for at Johnson's desire he had, some years before, given a
benefit-night at his theatre to this very person, by which she had got
two hundred pounds. Johnson, indeed, upon all other occasions, when I
was in his company, praised the very liberal charity of Garrick. I once
mentioned to him, 'It is observed, Sir, that you attack Garrick
yourself, but will suffer nobody else to do it.' JOHNSON, (smiling)
'Why, Sir, that is true.' BOSWELL. See _post_, May 15, 1776, and
April 17, 1778.

[1159] By Henry Home, Lord Kames, 3 vols. Edinburgh, 1762. See _post_,
Oct. 16, 1769. 'Johnson laughed much at Lord Kames's opinion that war
was a good thing occasionally, as so much valour and virtue were
exhibited in it. "A fire," says Johnson, "might as well be thought a
good thing; there is the bravery and address of the firemen employed in
extinguishing it; there is much humanity exerted in saving the lives and
properties of the poor sufferers; yet after all this, who can say a fire
is a good thing?"' Johnson's _Works_, (1787) xi. 209.

[1160] No. 45 of the _North Briton_ had been published on April 23.
Wilkes was arrested under a general warrant on April 30. On May 6 he was
discharged from custody by the Court of Common Pleas, before which he
had been brought by a writ of _Habeas Corpus_. A few days later he was
served with a subpoena upon an information exhibited against him by the
Attorney-General in the Court of King's Bench. He did not enter an
appearance, holding, as he said, the serving him with the subpoena as a
violation of the privilege of parliament. _Parl. Hist_. xv. 1360.

[1161] Mr. Sheridan was then reading lectures upon Oratory at Bath,
where Derrick was Master of the Ceremonies; or, as the phrase is, KING.
BOSWELL. Dr. Parr, who knew Sheridan well, describes him 'as a
wrong-headed, whimsical man.' 'I remember,' he continues, 'hearing one
of his daughters, in the house where I lodged, triumphantly repeat
Dryden's _Ode upon St. Cecilia's Day_, according to the instruction
given to her by her father. Take a sample:--

"_None_ but the brave
None but the _brave_.
None _but_ the brave deserve the fair."

Naughty Richard [R. B. Sheridan], like Gallio, seemed to care nought for
these things.' Moore's _Sheridan_, i. 9, 11. Sheridan writing from
Dublin on Dec. 7, 1771, says:--'Never was party violence carried to such
a height as in this session; the House [the Irish House of Parliament]
seldom breaking up till eleven or twelve at night. From these contests
the desire of improving in the article of elocution is become very
general. There are no less than five persons of rank and fortune now
waiting my leisure to become my pupils.' _Ib_. p. 60. See _post_,
July 28, 1763.

[1162] Bonnell Thornton. See _post_ July 1, 1763.

[1163] Lloyd was one of a remarkable group of Westminster boys. He was a
school-fellow not only of Churchill, the elder Colman, and Cumberland,
buy also of Cowper and Warren Hastings. Bonnell Thornton was a few years
their senior. Not many weeks after this meeting with Boswell, Lloyd was
in the Fleet prison. Churchill in _Indepence_(_Poems_ ii 310) thus
addresses the Patrons of the age:--

'Hence, ye vain boasters, to the Fleet repair
And ask, with blushes ask if Lloyd is there.'

Of the four men who thus enlivened Boswell, two were dead before the end
of the following year. Churchill went first. When Lloyd heard of his
death, '"I shall follow poor Charles," was all he said, as he went to
the bed from which he never rose again.' Thornton lived three or four
years longer, Forster's _Essays_, ii 217, 270, 289. See also his _Life
of Goldsmith_ i. 264, for an account how 'Lloyd invited Goldsmith to sup
with some friends of Grub Street, and left him to pay the reckoning.'
Thornton, Lloyd, Colman, Cowper, and Joseph Hill, to whom Cowper's
famous _Epistle_ was addressed, had at one time been members of the
Nonsense Club. Southey's _Cowper_, i. 37.

ever, if he would _abandon_ his mind to it;' _post_, under March
30, 1783.

[1168] 'Or behind the screen' some one might have added, _ante_, i. 163.

[1169] Wesley was told that a whole waggon-load of Methodists had been
lately brought before a Justice of the Peace. When he asked what they
were charged with, one replied, 'Why they pretended to be better than
other people, and besides they prayed from morning to night.' Wesley's
_Journal_, i. 361. See also _post_, 1780, near the end of Mr. Langton's
_Collection_.

[1170] 'The progress which the understanding makes through a book has'
he said, 'more pain than pleasure in it;' _post_, May 1, 1783.

[1171] _Matthew_, vi. 16.

[1172] Boswell, it is clear, in the early days of his acquaintance with
Johnson often led the talk to this subject. See _post_, June 25, July
14, 21, and 28, 1763.

[1173] See _post_, April 7, 1778.

[1174] He finished his day, 'however late it might be,' by taking tea at
Miss Williams's lodgings; _post_, July 1, 1763.

[1175] See _post_, under Feb. 15, 1766, Feb. 1767, March 20, 1776, and
Boswell's _Hebrides_, Sept. 20, 1773, where Johnson says:--'I have been
trying to cure my laziness all my life, and could not do it.' It was
this kind of life that caused so much of the remorse which is seen in
his _Prayers and Meditations_.

[1176] Horace Walpole writing on June 12, 1759 (_Letters_, iii. 231),
says:--'A war that reaches from Muscovy to Alsace, and from Madras to
California, don't produce an article half so long as Mr. Johnson's
riding three horses at once.' I have a curious copper-plate showing
Johnson standing on one, or two, and leading a third horse in full
speed.' It bears the date of November 1758. See _post_, April 3, 1778.

[1177] In the impudent _Correspondence_ (pp. 63, 65) which Boswell and
Andrew Erskine published this year, Boswell shows why he wished to enter
the Guards. 'My fondness for the Guards,' he writes, 'must appear very
strange to you, who have a rooted antipathy at the glare of scarlet. But
I must inform you, that there is a city called London, for which I have
as violent an affection as the most romantic lover ever had for his
mistress.... I am thinking of the brilliant scenes of happiness, which I
shall enjoy as an officer of the guards. How I shall be acquainted with
all the grandeur of a court, and all the elegance of dress and
diversions; become a favourite of ministers of state, and the adoration
of ladies of quality, beauty, and fortune! How many parties of pleasure
shall I have in town! How many fine jaunts to the noble seats of dukes,
lords, and members of parliament in the country! I am thinking of the
perfect knowledge which I shall acquire of men and manners, of the
intimacies which I shall have the honour to form with the learned and
ingenious in every science, and of the many amusing literary anecdotes
which I shall pick up,' etc. Boswell, in his _Hebrides_ (Aug. 18, 1773),
says of himself:--'His inclination was to be a soldier; but his father,
a respectable Judge, had pressed him into the profession of the law.'

[1178] A row of tenements in the Strand, between Wych Street and Temple
Bar, and 'so called from the butchers' shambles on the south side.'
(_Strype_, B. iv. p. 118.) Butcher Row was pulled down in 1813, and the
present Pickett Street erected in its stead. P. CUNNINGHAM. In _Humphry
Clinker_, in the letter of June 10, one of the poor authors is described
as having been 'reduced to a woollen night-cap and living upon
sheep's-trotters, up three pair of stairs backward in Butcher Row.'

[1179] Cibber was poet-laureate from 1730 to 1757. Horace Walpole
describes him as 'that good humoured and honest veteran, so unworthily
aspersed by Pope, whose _Memoirs_, with one or two of his comedies, will
secure his fame, in spite of all the abuse of his contemporaries.' His
successor Whitehead, Walpole calls 'a man of a placid genius.' _Reign of
George II_, iii. 81. See _ante_, pp. 149, 185, and _post_, Oct. 19,
1769, May 15, 1776, and Sept. 21, 1777.

[1180] The following quotations show the difference of style in the two
poets:--

              COLLEY GIBBER.

   'When her pride, fierce in arms,
      Would to Europe give law;
   At her cost let her come,
      To our cheer of huzza!
   Not lightning with thunder more terrible darts,
   Than the burst of huzza from our bold _British_ hearts.'

                     _Gent. Mag_. xxv. 515.

              WM. WHITEHEAD.

   'Ye guardian powers, to whose command,
      At Nature's birth, th' Almighty mind
      The delegated task assign'd
   To watch o'er Albion's favour'd land,
   What time your hosts with choral lay,
      Emerging from its kindred deep,
      Applausive hail'd each verdant steep,
   And white rock, glitt'ring to the new-born day!'

                     _Ib_. xxix. 32.

[1181] See _ante_, p. 167.

[1182] 'Whitehead was for some while Garrick's "reader" of new plays for
Drury-lane.' Forster's _Goldsmith_, ii. 41. See _post_, April 25, 1778,
note. The verses to Garrick are given in Chalmers's _English Poets_,
xvii. 222.

[1183] 'In 1757 Gray published _The Progress of Poetry_ and _The Bard_,
two compositions at which the readers of poetry were at first content to
gaze in mute amazement. Some that tried them confessed their inability
to understand them.... Garrick wrote a few lines in their praisc. Some
hardy champions undertook to rescue them from neglect; and in a short
time many were content to be shown beauties which they could not see.'
Johnson's _Works_, viii. 478. See _post_, March 28, and April 2, 1775,
and 1780 in Mr. Langton's _Collection_. Goldsmith, no doubt, attacked
Gray among 'the misguided innovators,' of whom he said in his _Life of
Parnell_:--'They have adopted a language of their own, and call upon
mankind for admiration. All those who do not understand them are silent,
and those who make out their meaning are willing to praise to show they
understand.' Goldsmith's _Misc. Works_, iv. 22.

[1184] Johnson, perhaps, refers to the anonymous critic quoted by Mason
in his notes on this Ode, who says:--'This abrupt execration plunges the
reader into that sudden fearful perplexity which is designed to
predominate through the whole.' Mason's _Gray_, ed. 1807, i. 96.

[1185] 'Of the first stanza [of _The Bard_] the abrupt beginning has
been celebrated; but technical beauties can give praise only to the
inventor. It is in the power of any man to rush abruptly upon his
subject that has read the ballad of _Johnny Armstrong_.' Johnson's
_Works_, viii. 485.

[1186] My friend Mr. Malone, in his valuable comments on Shakspeare, has
traced in that great poet the _disjecta membra_ of these lines. BOSWELL.
Gray, in the edition of _The Bard_ of the year 1768, in a note on these
lines had quoted from _King John_, act v. sc. 1:--'Mocking the air with
colours idly spread.' Gosse's _Gray_, i. 41. But Malone quotes also from
_Macbeth_, act i. sc. 2:--

'Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
And fan our people cold.'

'Out of these passages,' he said, 'Mr. Gray seems to have framed the
first stanza of his celebrated _Ode_.' Malone's _Shakespeare_, xv. 344.

[1187] Cradock records (_Memoirs_, 1.230) that Goldsmith said to
him:--'You are so attached to Kurd, Gray, and Mason, that you think
nothing good can proceed but out of that formal school;--now, I'll mend
Gray's _Elegy_ by leaving out an idle word in every line.

"The curfew tolls the knell of day,
The lowing herd winds o'er the lea
The ploughman homeward plods his way
And---"

Enough, enough, I have no ear for more.'

[1188] So, less than two years later, Boswell opened his mind to Paoli.
'My time passed here in the most agreeable manner. I enjoyed a sort of
luxury of noble sentiment. Paoli became more affable with me. I made
myself known to him.' Boswell's _Corsica_, p. 167.

[1189] See _ante_, p. 67.

[1190] See _post_, Sept. 22, 1777.

[1191] See _post_, March 30, 1778, where in speaking of the appearance
of spirits after death he says:--'All argument is against it; but all
belief is for it.' See also _ante_, p. 343, and _post_, April 15, 1778,
under May 4, 1779, April 15, 1781, and June 12, 1784.

[1192] The caricature begins:--

'Pomposo, insolent and loud
Vain idol of a _scribbling_ crowd,
Whose very name inspires an awe
Whose ev'ry word is Sense and Law.'

Churchill's _Poems_, i. 216.

[1193] The chief impostor, a man of the name of Parsons, had, it should
seem, set his daughter to play the part of the ghost in order to pay out
a grudge against a man who had sued him for a debt. The ghost was made
to accuse this man of poisoning his sister-in-law, and to declare that
she should only be at ease in her mind if he were hanged. 'When Parsons
stood on the Pillory at the end of Cock Lane, instead of being pelted,
he had money given him.' _Gent. Mag_. xxxii. 43, 82, and xxxiii. 144.

[1194] Horace Walpole, writing on Feb. 2, 1762 (_Letters_, iii. 481),
says:--'I could send you volumes on the Ghost, and I believe, if I were
to stay a little, I might send its _life_, dedicated to my Lord
Dartmouth, by the Ordinary of Newgate, its two great patrons. A drunken
parish clerk set it on foot out of revenge, the Methodists have adopted
it, and the whole town of London think of nothing else.... I went to
hear it, for it is not an _apparition_, but an _audition_, ... the Duke
of York, Lady Northumberland, Lady Mary Coke, Lord Hertford, and I, all
in one Hackney-coach: it rained torrents; yet the lane was full of mob,
and the house so full we could not get in.' See _post_, April 10, 1778.

[1195] Described by Goldsmith in _Retaliation_ as 'The scourge of
impostors, the terror of quacks.' See _ante_, p. 229.

[1196] The account was as follows:--'On the night of the 1st of February
[1762] many gentlemen eminent for their rank and character were, by the
invitation of the Reverend Mr. Aldrich, of Clerkenwell, assembled at his
house, for the examination of the noises supposed to be made by a
departed spirit, for the detection of some enormous crime.

'About ten at night the gentlemen met in the chamber in which the girl,
supposed to be disturbed by a spirit, had, with proper caution, been put
to bed by several ladies. They sat rather more than an hour, and hearing
nothing, went down stairs, when they interrogated the father of the
girl, who denied, in the strongest terms, any knowledge or belief
of fraud.

'The supposed spirit had before publickly promised, by an affirmative
knock, that it would attend one of the gentlemen into the vault under
the Church of St. John, Clerkenwell, where the body is deposited, and
give a token of her presence there, by a knock upon her coffin; it was
therefore determined to make this trial of the existence or veracity of
the supposed spirit.

'While they were enquiring and deliberating, they were summoned into the
girl's chamber by some ladies who were near her bed, and who had heard
knocks and scratches. When the gentlemen entered, the girl declared that
she felt the spirit like a mouse upon her back, and was required to hold
her hands out of bed. From that time, though the spirit was very
solemnly required to manifest its existence by appearance, by impression
on the hand or body of any present, by scratches, knocks, or any other
agency, no evidence of any preter-natural power was exhibited.

'The spirit was then very seriously advertised that the person to whom
the promise was made of striking the coffin, was then about to visit the
vault, and that the performance of the promise was then claimed. The
company at one o'clock went into the church, and the gentleman to whom
the promise was made, went with another into the vault. The spirit was
solemnly required to perform its promise, but nothing more than silence
ensued: the person supposed to be accused by the spirit, then went down
with several others, but no effect was perceived. Upon their return they
examined the girl, but could draw no confession from her. Between two
and three she desired and was permitted to go home with her father.

'It is, therefore, the opinion of the whole assembly, that the child has
some art of making or counterfeiting a particular noise, and that there
is no agency of any higher cause.' BOSWELL. _Gent. Mag_. xxxii. 81. The
following MS. letter is in the British Museum:--

'REVD. SIR,

The appointment for the examination stands as it did when I saw you
last, viz., between 8 and 9 this evening. Mr. Johnson was applied to by
a friend of mine soon after you left him, and promised to be with us.
Should be glad, if convenient, you'd show him the way hither. Mrs.
Oakes, of Dr. Macauley's recommendation, I should be glad to have here
on the occasion; and think it would do honour to the list of examiners
to have Dr. Macauley with us.

I am, Dear Sir,
your most obedient servant,
STE. ALDRICH.

If Dr Macauley can conveniently attend, should be glad you'd acquaint
Lord Dartmouth with it, who seemed to be at loss to recommend a
gentleman of the faculty at his end of the town.

St. John's Square. Monday noon.

To the Revd. Dr. Douglas.'

Endorsed 'Mr. Aldrich, Feb. 1762, about the Cock Lane
ghost.--Examination at his house.'

[1197] Boswell was with Paoli when news came that a Corsican under
sentence of death 'had consented to accept of his life, upon condition
of becoming hangman. This made a great noise among the Corsicans, who
were enraged at the creature, and said their nation was now disgraced.
Paoli did not think so. He said to me:--"I am glad of this. It will be
of service. It will contribute to form us to a just subordination. As we
must have Corsican tailours, and Corsican shoemakers, we must also have
a Corsican hangman."' Boswell's _Corsica_, p. 201. See _post_, July 20
and 21, 1763, April 13, 1773, and March 28, 1775.

[1200] 'A man had heard that Dempster was very clever, and therefore
expected that he could say nothing but good things. Being brought
acquainted, Mr. Dempster said to him with much politeness, "I hope, Sir,
your lady and family are well." "Ay, ay, man," said he, "pray where is
the great wit in that speech?"' _Boswelliana_, p. 307. Mr. Dempster is
mentioned by Burns in _The Author's Earnest Cry and Prayer to the Scotch
Representatives in the House of Commons_:--'Dempster, a true-blue Scot
I'se warran.' In 1769 he was elected member for the Forfar Boroughs.
_Parl. Hist_. xvi. 453.

[1201] _The Critical Review_, in which Mallet himself sometimes wrote,
characterised this pamphlet as 'the crude efforts of envy, petulance and
self conceit.' There being thus three epithets, we, the three authours,
had a humourous contention how each should be appropriated. BOSWELL.

[1202] Johnson (_Works_, ix. 86) talks of the chiefs 'gradually
degenerating from patriarchal rulers to rapacious landlords.' In
Boswell's _Hebrides_, the subject is often examined.

[1203] See _ante_, i. 365.

[1204] 'Dr. Burney spoke with great warmth of affection of Dr. Johnson;
said he was the kindest creature in the world when he thought he was
loved and respected by others. He would play the fool among friends, but
he required deference. It was necessary to ask questions and make no
assertion. If you said two and two make four, he would say, "How will
you prove that, Sir?" Dr. Burney seemed amiably sensitive to every
unfavourable remark on his old friend.' H. C. Robinson's _Diary_,
iii. 485.

[1205] See _post_, April 24, 1777, note, and Oct. l0, 1779, where he
consults Johnson about the study of Greek. He formed wishes, scarcely
plans of study but never studied.

[1206] See _post_, Feb. 18, 1777. It was Graham who so insulted
Goldsmith by saying:--''Tis not you I mean, Dr. _Minor_; 'tis Dr.
_Major_ there.' Boswell's _Hebrides_, Aug. 24, 1773.

[1207] See _post_, Sept. 19, 1777.

[1208] Of Mathematics Goldsmith wrote:--'This seems a science to which
the meanest intellects are equal.' See _post_, March 15, 1776, note.

[1209] In his _Present State of Polite Learning_, ch. 13 (_Misc. Works_,
i. 266), Goldsmith writes:--'A man who is whirled through Europe in a
post-chaise, and the pilgrim who walks the grand tour on foot, will form
very different conclusions. _Haud inexpertus loquor_.' The last three
words are omitted in the second edition.

[1210] George Primrose in the _Vicar of Wakefield_ (ch. 20), after
describing these disputations, says:--'In this manner I fought my way
towards England.'

[1211] Dr. Warton wrote to his brother on Jan. 22, 1766:--'Of all solemn
coxcombs Goldsmith is the first; yet sensible--but affects to use
Johnson's hard words in conversation.' Wooll's _Warton_, p. 312.

[1212] It was long believed that the author of one of Goldsmith's early
works was Lord Lyttelton. '"Whenever I write anything," said Goldsmith,
"I think the public _make a point_ to know nothing about it." So the
present book was issued as a _History of England in a series of Letters
from a Nobleman to his Son_. The persuasion at last became general that
the author was Lord Lyttelton, and the name of that grave good lord is
occasionally still seen affixed to it on the bookstalls.' Forster's
_Goldsmith_, i. 301. The _Traveller_ was the first of his works to which
he put his name. It was published in 1764. 16. p. 364.

'Qui nullum fere scribendi genus
Non tetigit,
Nullum quod tetigit non ornavit.'

_Post_, under June 22, 1776.

[1216] In allusion to this, Mr. Horace Walpole, who admired his
writings, said he was 'an inspired ideot;' and Garrick described him
as one

'----for shortness call'd Noll,
Who wrote like an angel, and
talk'd like poor Poll.'

Sir Joshua Reynolds mentioned to me that he frequently heard Goldsmith
talk warmly of the pleasure of being liked, and observe how hard it
would be if literary excellence should preclude a man from that
satisfaction, which he perceived it often did, from the envy which
attended it; and therefore Sir Joshua was convinced that he was
intentionally more absurd, in order to lessen himself in social
intercourse, trusting that his character would be sufficiently supported
by his works. If it indeed was his intention to appear absurd in
company, he was often very successful. But with due deference to Sir
Joshua's ingenuity, I think the conjecture too refined. BOSWELL.

Horace Walpole's saying of the 'inspired ideot' is recorded in Davies's
_Garrick_, ii. 151. Walpole, in his _Letters_, describes Goldsmith as 'a
changeling that has had bright gleams of parts,' (v. 458); 'a fool, the
more wearing for having some sense,' (vi. 29); 'a poor soul that had
sometimes parts, though never common sense,' (_ib_. p. 73); and 'an
idiot, with once or twice a fit of parts,' (_ib_. p. 379).
Garrick's lines--

'Here lies Nolly Goldsmith, for shortness called Noll,
Who wrote like an angel, but talked like poor Poll,'

are his imaginary epitaph on Goldsmith, which, with the others, gave
rise to _Retaliation_. Forster's _Goldsmith_, ii. 405.

[1217] Rousseau accounting for the habit he has 'de balbutier
promptement des paroles sans idées,' continues, 'je crois que voilà de
quoi faire assez comprendre comment n'étant pas un sot, j'ai cependant
souvent passé pour l'être, même chez des gens en état de bien juger....
Le parti que j'ai pris d'écrire et de me cacher est précisément celui
qui me convenait. Moi présent on n'aurait jamais su ce que je valois, on
ne l'aurait pas soupconné même.' _Les Confessions_, Livre iii. See
_post_, April 27, 1773, where Boswell admits that 'Goldsmith was often
very fortunate in his witty contests, even when he entered the lists
with Johnson himself:' and April 30, 1773, where Reynolds says of him:
'There is no man whose company is more liked.'

[1218] Northcote, a few weeks before his death, said to Mr.
Prior:--'When Goldsmith entered a room, Sir, people who did not know him
became for a moment silent from awe of his literary reputation; when he
came out again, they were riding upon his back.' Prior's _Goldsmith_, i.
440. According to Dr. Percy:--'His face was marked with strong lines of
thinking. His first appearance was not captivating; but when he grew
easy and cheerful in company, he relaxed into such a display of good
humour as soon removed every unfavourable impression.' Goldsmith's
_Misc. Works_, i. 117.

[1219] 'Dr. Goldsmith told me, he himself envied Shakespeare.' Walpole's
_Letters_, vi. 379. Boswell, later on (_post_, May 9, 1773), says:--'In
my opinion Goldsmith had not more of it [an envious disposition] than
other people have, but only talked of it freely.' See also _post_, April
12, 1778. According to Northcote, 'Sir Joshua said that Goldsmith
considered public notoriety or fame as one great parcel, to the whole of
which he laid claim, and whoever partook of any part of it, whether
dancer, singer, slight of hand man, or tumbler, deprived him of his
right.' Northcote's _Reynolds_, i. 248. See _post_, April 7, 1778, where
Johnson said that 'Goldsmith was not an agreeable companion, for he
talked always for fame;' and April 9, 1778.

[1220] Miss Hornecks, one of whom is now married to Henry Bunbury, Esq.,
and the other to Colonel Gwyn. BOSWELL.

[1221] 'Standing at the window of their hotel [in Lisle] to see a
company of soldiers in the Square, the beauty of the sisters Horneck
drew such marked admiration, that Goldsmith, heightening his drollery
with that air of solemnity so generally a point in his humour and so
often more solemnly misinterpreted, turned off from the window with the
remark that elsewhere _he_ too could have his admirers. The Jessamy
Bride, Mrs. Gwyn, was asked about the occurrence not many years ago;
remembered it as a playful jest; and said how shocked she had
subsequently been "to see it adduced in print as a proof of his envious
disposition."' Forster's _Goldsmith_, ii. 217.

[1222] Puppets.

[1223] He went home with Mr. Burke to supper; and broke his shin by
attempting to exhibit to the company how much better he could jump over
a stick than the puppets. BOSWELL. Mr. Hoole was one day in a coach with
Johnson, when 'Johnson, who delighted in rapidity of pace, and had been
speaking of Goldsmith, put his head out of one of the windows to see
they were going right, and rubbing his hands with an air of satisfaction
exclaimed:--"This man drives fast and well; were Goldsmith here now he
would tell us he could do better."' Prior's _Goldsmith_, ii. 127.

[1224] See _post_, April 9, 1773; also April 9, 1778, where Johnson
says, 'Goldsmith had no settled notions upon any subject.'

[1225] I am willing to hope that there may have been some mistake as to
this anecdote, though I had it from a Dignitary of the Church. Dr. Isaac
Goldsmith, his near relation, was Dean of Cloyne, in 1747. BOSWELL. This
note first appears in the second edition.

[1226] Mr. Welsh, in _A Bookseller of the Last Century_, p. 58, quotes
the following entry from an account-book of B. Collins of Salisbury, the
printer of the first edition of the _Vicar_:--'_Vicar of Wakefield_, 2
vols. 12mo., 1/3rd. B. Collins, Salisbury, bought of Dr. Goldsmith, the
author, October 28, 1762, £21.' Goldsmith, it should seem from this, as
Collins's third share was worth twenty guineas, was paid not sixty
pounds, but sixty guineas. Collins shared in many of the ventures of
Newbery, Goldsmith's publisher. Mr. Welsh says (_ib_. p. 61) that
Collins's accounts show 'that the first three editions resulted in a
loss.' If this was so, the booksellers must have been great bunglers,
for the book ran through three editions in six or seven months.
Forster's _Goldsmith_, i. 425.

[1227] The Traveller (price one shilling and sixpence) was published in
December 1764, and _The Vicar of Wakefield_ in March 1766. In August
1765 the fourth edition of _The Traveller_ appeared, and the ninth in
the year Goldsmith died. He received for it £21. Forster's _Goldsmith_,
i. 364, 374, 409. See _ante_, p. 193, note i.

[1228] '"Miss Burney," said Mrs. Thrale [to Dr. Johnson], "is fond of
_The Vicar of Wakefield_, and so am I. Don't you like it, Sir?" "No,
madam, it is very faulty; there is nothing of real life in it, and very
little of nature. It is a mere fanciful performance."' Mme. D'Arblay's
_Diary_, i. 83. 'There are a hundred faults in this Thing,' said
Goldsmith in the preface, 'and a hundred things might be said to prove
them beauties. But it is needless. A book may be amusing with numerous
errors, or it may be very dull without a single absurdity.' See _post_,
April 25, 1778.

[1230] _Life of Johnson_, p. 420. BOSWELL.

[1231] In his imprudence he was like Savage, of whom Johnson says
(_Works_, viii. 161):--'To supply him with money was a hopeless attempt;
for no sooner did he see himself master of a sum sufficient to set him
free from care for a day, than he became profuse and luxurious.' When
Savage was 'lodging in the liberties of the Fleet, his friends sent him
every Monday a guinea, which he commonly spent before the next morning,
and trusted, after his usual manner, the remaining part of the week to
the bounty of fortune.' _Ib_. p. 170.

[1232] It may not be improper to annex here Mrs. Piozzi's account of
this transaction, in her own words, as a specimen of the extreme
inaccuracy with which all her anecdotes of Dr. Johnson are related, or
rather discoloured and distorted:--'I have forgotten the year, but it
could scarcely, I think, be later than 1765 or 1766 that he was _called
abruptly from our house after dinner_, and returning _in about three
hours_, said he had been with an enraged authour, whose landlady pressed
him for payment within doors, while the bailiffs beset him without; that
he was _drinking himself drunk_ with Madeira, to drown care, and
fretting over a novel, which, when _finished_, was to be his _whole
fortune_, but _he could not get it done for distraction_, nor could he
step out of doors to offer it for sale. Mr. Johnson, therefore, sent
away the bottle, and went to the bookseller, recommending the
performance, and _desiring some immediate relief_; which when he brought
back to the writer, _he called the 'woman of the house directly to
partake of punch, and pass their time in merriment.' Anecdotes of Dr.
Johnson_, p. 119. BOSWELL. The whole transaction took place in 1762, as
is shown, _ante_, p. 415, note 1; Johnson did not know the Thrales
till 1764.

[1233] Through Goldsmith Boswell became acquainted with Reynolds. In his
_Letter to the People of Scotland_ (p. 99), he says:--'I exhort you, my
friends and countrymen, in the words of my departed _Goldsmith_, who
gave me many nodes _Atticae_, and gave me a jewel of the finest
water--the acquaintance of Sir Joshua Reynolds.'

[1234] See _post_, July 30, 1763.

[1235] See _post_, March 20, 1776, and Boswell's _Hebrides_, Oct. 17,
1773.

[1236] See _post_, March 15, 1776.

[1237] 'Dr. Campbell was an entertaining story-teller, which [_sic_]
sometimes he rather embellished; so that the writer of this once heard
Dr. Johnson say:--"Campbell will lie, but he never lies on paper."'
_Gent. Mag_. for 1785, p. 969.

[1238] I am inclined to think that he was misinformed as to this
circumstance. I own I am jealous for my worthy friend Dr. John Campbell.
For though Milton could without remorse absent himself from publick
worship [Johnson's _Works_, vii. 115] I cannot. On the contrary, I have
the same habitual impressions upon my mind, with those of a truely
venerable Judge, who said to Mr. Langton, 'Friend Langton, if I have not
been at church on Sunday, I do not feel myself easy.' Dr. Campbell was a
sincerely religious man. Lord Macartney, who is eminent for his variety
of knowledge, and attention to men of talents, and knew him well, told
me, that when he called on him in a morning, he found him reading a
chapter in the Greek New Testament, which he informed his Lordship was
his constant practice. The quantity of Dr. Campbell's composition is
almost incredible, and his labours brought him large profits. Dr. Joseph
Warton told me that Johnson said of him, 'He is the richest authour that
ever grazed the common of literature.' BOSWELL.

[1239] See _post_, April 7, 1778. Campbell complied with one of the
_Monita Padagogica_ of Erasmus. 'Si quem praeteribis natu grandem,
magistratum, sacerdotem, doctorem.... memento aperire caput.... Itidem
facito quum praeteribis asdem sacram.' Erasmus's _Colloquies_, ed.
1867, i. 36.

[1240] Reynolds said of Johnson:--'He was not easily imposed upon by
professions to honesty and candour; but he appeared to have little
suspicion of hypocrisy in religion.' Taylor's _Reynolds_, ii. 459.
Boswell, in one of his penitent letters, wrote to Temple on July 21,
1790:--'I am even almost inclined to think with you, that my great
oracle Johnson did allow too much credit to good principles, without
good practice.' _Letters of Boswell_, p. 327.

[1241] Campbell lived in 'the large new-built house at the
north-west-corner of Queen Square, Bloomsbury, whither, particularly on
a Sunday evening, great numbers of persons of the first eminence for
science and literature resorted for the enjoyment of conversation.'
Hawkins's _Johnson_, p. 210.

[1242] Churchill, in his first poem, _The Rosciad_ (Poems, i. 4),
mentions Johnson without any disrespect among those who were thought
of as judge.

'For Johnson some, but Johnson, it was feared,
Would be too grave; and Sterne too gay appeared.'

In The Author (ib. ii. 36), if I mistake not, he grossly alludes to the
convulsive disorder to which Johnson was subject. Attacking the
pensioners he says--the italics are his own:--

'Others, _half-palsied_ only, mutes become,
And what makes Smollett write makes Johnson dumb.'

[1243] See _post_, April 6, 1772, where Johnson called Fielding a
blockhead.

[1244] Churchill published his first poem, _The Rosciad_, in March or
April 1761 (_Gent. Mag_. xxxi. 190); _The Apology_ in May or June (_Ib_.
p. 286); _Night_ in Jan. 1762 (_Ib_. xxxii. 47); The First and Second
Parts of The Ghost in March (_ib_. p. 147); The Third Part in the autumn
(_ib_. p. 449); _The Prophecy of Famine _in Jan. 1763 (_ib_. xxxiii.
47), and _The Epistle to Hogarth_ in this month of July (_ib_. p. 363).
He wrote the fourth part of _The Ghost_, and nine more poems, and died
on Nov. 4, 1764, aged thirty-two or thirty-three.

[1245] 'Cowper had a higher opinion of Churchill than of any other
contemporary writer. "It is a great thing," he said, "to be indeed a
poet, and does not happen to more than one man in a century; but
Churchill, the great Churchill, deserved that name." He made him, more
than any other writer, his model.' Southey's _Cowper_, i. 87, 8.

[1246] Mr. Forster says that 'Churchill asked five guineas for the
manuscript of _The Rosciad_ (according to Southey, but Mr. Tooke says he
asked twenty pounds).' Finding no purchaser he brought the poem out at
his own risk. Mr. Forster continues:--'The pulpit had starved him on
forty pounds a year; the public had given him a thousand pounds in two
months.' Forster's _Essays_, ii. 226, 240. As _The Rosciad _was sold at
one shilling a copy, it seems incredible that such a gain could have
been made, even with the profits of _The Apology_ included. 'Blotting
and correcting was so much Churchill's abhorrence that I have heard from
his publisher he once energetically expressed himself, that it was like
cutting away one's own flesh.' D'Israeli's _Curiosities of Literature_,
ed. 1834, iii. 129. D'Israeli 'had heard that after a successful work he
usually precipitated the publication of another, relying on its
crudeness being passed over by the public curiosity excited by its
better brother. He called this getting double pay, for thus he secured
the sale of a hurried work.'

[1247] In the opening lines of _Gotham,_ Bk. iii, there is a passage of
great beauty and tenderness.

[1248] In 1769 I set Thornton's burlesque _Ode_. It was performed at
Ranelagh in masks, to a very crowded audience, as I was told; for I then
resided in Norfolk. BURNEY. Dr. Burney's note cannot be correct. He came
to reside in London in 1760 (_Memoirs of Dr. Burney_, i. 133) The Ode is
in the list of 'new books, published' in the _Gent. Mag_. for June 1763,
and is described as having been performed at Ranelagh.

[1249] _The Connoisseur_ was started by Thornton and Colman in 1754.
Cowper and Lloyd were contributors. Southey's _Cowper_, i. 46, 49, 65.

[1253] The northern bard mentioned page 421. When I asked Dr. Johnson's
permission to introduce him, he obligingly agreed; adding, however, with
a sly pleasantry, 'but he must give us none of his poetry.' It is
remarkable that Johnson and Churchill, however much they differed in
other points, agreed on this subject. See Churchill's _Journey_.

['Under dark Allegory's flimsy veil
  Let Them with Ogilvie spin out a tale
  Of rueful length,'
       Churchill's _Poems_, ii. 329.]

It is, however, but justice to Dr. Ogilvie to observe, that his _Day of
Judgement_ has no inconsiderable share of merit. BOSWELL.

[1254] 'Johnson said:--"Goldsmith should not be for ever attempting to
_shine_ in conversation."' _Post_, April 27, 1773. See also _post_,
May 7, 1773.

[1255] Fifteen years later Lord George Germaine, Secretary of State,
asserted in a debate 'that the King "was his own Minister," which
Charles Fox took up admirably, lamenting that His Majesty "was his own
_unadvised_ Minister."' Walpole's _Journal of the Reign of George
III_, ii. 314.

[1256] 'The general story of mankind will evince that lawful and settled
authority is very seldom resisted when it is well employed.... Men are
easily kept obedient to those who have temporal dominion in their hands,
till their veneration is dissipated by such wickedness and folly as can
neither be defended nor concealed.' _The Rambler_, No. 50. See _post_,
March 31, 1772.

[1257] 'It is natural to believe ... that no writer has a more easy task
than the historian. The philosopher has the works of omniscience to
examine.... The poet trusts to his invention.... But the happy historian
has no other labour than of gathering what tradition pours down before
him, or records treasure for his use.' _The Rambler_, No. 122.

[1258] See Boswell's _Hebrides_, Aug. 21, 1773.

[1259] 'Arbuthnot was a man of great comprehension, skilful in his
profession, versed in the sciences, acquainted with ancient literature,
and able to animate his mass of knowledge by a bright and active
imagination; a scholar with great brilliancy of wit; a wit, who in the
crowd of life retained and discovered a noble ardour of religious zeal.'
Johnson's _Works_, viii. 296.

[1260] Goldsmith wrote from Edinburgh in 1753:--'Shall I tire you with a
description of this unfruitful country, where I must lead you over their
hills all brown with heath, or their vallies scarce able to feed a
rabbit? Man alone seems to be the only creature who has arrived to the
natural size in this poor soil. Every part of the country presents the
same dismal landscape.' Forster's _Goldsmith_, i. 433.

[1261] See Boswell's _Hebrides_, Nov. 10, 1773.

[1262] Johnson would suffer none of his friends to fill up chasms in
conversation with remarks on the weather: 'Let us not talk of the
weather.' BURNEY.

[1263] See _ante_, p. 332.

[1264] Boswell wrote to Temple on Sept. 9, 1767:--'How unaccountable is
it that my father and I should be so ill together! He is a man of sense
and a man of worth; but from some unhappy turn in his disposition he is
much dissatisfied with a son whom you know. I write to him with warmth,
with an honest pride, wishing that he should think of me as I am; but my
letters shock him, and every expression in them is interpreted
unfavourably. To give you an instance, I send you a letter I had from
him a few days ago. How galling is it to the friend of Paoli to be
treated so! I have answered him in my own style; I will be myself.'
_Letters of Boswell_, p. 110. In the following passage in one of his
_Hypochondriacks_ he certainly describes his father. 'I knew a father
who was a violent Whig, and used to attack his son for being a Tory,
upbraiding him with being deficient in "noble sentiments of liberty,"
while at the same time he made this son live under his roof in such
bondage, that he was not only afraid to stir from home without leave,
like a child, but durst scarcely open his mouth in his father's
presence. This was sad living. Yet I would rather see such an excess of
awe than a degree of familiarity between father and son by which all
reverence is destroyed.' _London Mag_. 1781, p. 253.

[1265] Boswell, the day after this talk, wrote:--'I have had a long
letter from my father, full of affection and good counsel. Honest man!
he is now very happy: it is amazing to think how much he has had at
heart, my pursuing the road of civil life.' _Letters of Boswell_, p. 25.

[1266] Gray, says Nicholls, 'disliked all poetry in blank verse, except
Milton.' Gray's _Works_, ed. 1858, v. 36. Goldsmith, in his _Present
State of Polite Learning_ (ch. xi.), wrote in 1759:--'From a desire in
the critic of grafting the spirit of ancient languages upon the English
have proceeded of late several disagreeable instances of pedantry. Among
the number, I think, we may reckon blank verse. Nothing but the greatest
sublimity of subject can render such a measure pleasing; however, we now
see it used upon the most trivial occasions.' On the same page he speaks
of 'the tuneless flow of our blank verse.' See _post_, 1770, in Dr.
Maxwell's _Collectanea_ and the beginning of 1781, under _The Life of
Milton_, for Johnson's opinion of blank verse.

[1267] 'Johnson told me, that one day in London, when Dr. Adam Smith was
boasting of Glasgow, he turned to him and said, "Pray, Sir, have you
ever seen Brentford?'" Boswell's _Hebrides_, Oct. 29, 1773. See _post_,
April 29, 1778.

[1268] 'He advised me to read just as inclination prompted me, which
alone, he said, would do me any good; for I had better go into company
than read a set task. He said, too, that I should prescribe to myself
five hours a day, and in these hours gratify whatever literary desires
may spring up.' _Letters of Boswell_, p. 28. The Editor of these
_Letters_ compares Tranio's advice:--

'No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en:
In brief, Sir, study what you most affect.'

_Taming of the Shrew_, act i. sc. I.

'Johnson used to say that no man read long together with a folio on his
table. "Books," said he, "that you may carry to the fire, and hold
readily in your hand, are the most useful after all."' Johnson's _Works_
(1787), xi. 197. See also _The Idler_, No. 67, and _post_, April 12,
1776, and under Sept. 22, 1777.

[1269] Wilkes, among others, had attacked him in Aug. 1762 in _The North
Briton_, Nos. xi. and xii.

[1270] When I mentioned the same idle clamour to him several years
afterwards, he said, with a smile, 'I wish my pension were twice as
large, that they might make twice as much noise.' BOSWELL.

[1271] In one thing at least he was changed. He could now indulge in the
full bent, to use his own words (_Works_, viii. l36), 'that
inquisitiveness which must always be produced in a vigorous mind, by an
absolute freedom from all pressing or domestick engagements.'

[1272] See _post_, April 13, 1773, Sept. 17 and 19, 1777, March 21,
1783, and June 9, 1784. Lord Shelburne says:--'After the Revolution the
Tory and Jacobite parties had become almost identified by their together
opposing the Court for so many years, and still more by the persecution
which they suffered in common, for it was the policy of Sir Robert
Walpole to confound them as much as possible, so as to throw the
Jacobite odium upon every man who opposed government.' Fitzmaurice's
_Shelburne_, i. 35. Lord Bolingbroke (_Works_, iii. 28) complains that
the writers on the side of the ministry 'frequently throw out that every
man is a friend to the Pretender who is not a friend of Walpole.'

[1275] Mr. Walmsley died in 1751 (_ante_, p. 81). Johnson left Lichfield
in 1737. Unless Mr. Walmsley after 1737 visited London from time to
time, he can scarcely be meant.

[1276] See _ante_, p. 336.

[1277] He used to tell, with great humour, from my relation to him, the
following little story of my early years, which was literally true:
'Boswell, in the year 1745, was a fine boy, wore a white cockade, and
prayed for King James, till one of his uncles (General Cochran) gave him
a shilling on condition that he should pray for King George, which he
accordingly did. So you see (says Boswell) that _Whigs of all ages are
made the same way_.' BOSWELL. Johnson, in his _Dictionary_ under
_Whiggism_, gives only one quotation, namely, from Swift: 'I could quote
passages from fifty pamphlets, wholly made up of whiggism and atheism.'
See _post_, April 28, 1778, where he said: 'I have always said, the
first _Whig_ was the Devil;' and Boswell's _Hebrides_, Oct. 21 and Nov.
8, 1773. To Johnson's sayings might be opposed one of Lord Chatham's in
the House of Lords: 'There are some distinctions which are inherent in
the nature of things. There is a distinction between right and
wrong--between Whig and Tory.' _Parl. Hist_. xvi. 1107.

[1278] _Letter to Rutland on Travel_, 16mo. 1569. BOSWELL. This letter
is contained in a little volume entitled, _Profitable Instructions;
describing what special observations are to be taken by travellers in
all nations, states and countries; pleasant and profitable. By the three
much admired, Robert, late Earl of Essex, Sir Philip Sidney, and
Secretary Davison. London. Printed for Benjamin Fisher, at the Sign of
the Talbot, without Aldersgate_. 1633. (Lowndes gives the date of 1613,
but the earliest edition seems to be this of 1633.) The letter from
which Boswell quotes is entitled, _The late E. of E. his advice to the
E. of R. in his Travels_. It is dated Greenwich, Jan. 4, 1596. Mr.
Spedding (Bacon's _Works_, ix. 4) suggests that 'it may have been
(wholly or in part) written by Bacon.'

[1279] Boswell (_Boswelliana_, p. 210) says that this 'impudent fellow'
was Macpherson.

[1280] Boswell repeated this saying and some others to Paoli. 'I felt an
elation of mind to see Paoli delighted with the sayings of Mr. Johnson,
and to hear him translate them with Italian energy to the Corsican
heroes.' Here Boswell describes the person as 'a certain authour.'
Boswell's _Corsica_, p. 199

[1281] Boswell thus takes him off in his comic poem _The Court of
Session Garland_:--

'"This cause," cries Hailes, "to judge I can't pretend, For _justice_, I
percieve, wants an _e_ at the end."'

Mr. R. Chambers, in a note on this, says:--'A story is told of Lord
Hailes once making a serious objection to a law-paper, an in consequence
to the whole suit, on account of the word _justice_ being thus spelt.
_Traditions of Edinburgh_, ii. 161. Burke says that he 'found him to be
a clever man, and generally knowing.' Burke's _Corres_. iii. 301. See
_ante_ p. 267, and _post_ May 12, 1774 and Boswell's _Hebrides_,
Aug. 17, 1773.

[1282] 'Ita feri ut se mori sentiat.' Suetonius, _Caligula_, chap. xxx.

[1283] Johnson himself was constantly purposing to keep a journal. On
April 11, 1773, he told Boswell 'that he had twelve or fourteen times
attempted to keep a journal of his life,' _post_, April 11, 1773. The
day before he had recorded:--'I hope from this time to keep a journal.'
_Pr. and Med_. p. 124. Like records follow, as:--'Sept. 24, 1773. My
hope is, for resolution I dare no longer call it, to divide my time
regularly, and to keep such a journal of my time, as may give me comfort
in reviewing it.' _Ib_. p. 132. 'April 6, 1777. My purpose once more is
To keep a journal.' _Ib_. p. 161. 'Jan. 2, 1781. My hope is To keep a
journal.' _Ib_. p. 188. See also _post_, April 14, 1775, and April
10, 1778.

[1284] Boswell, when he was only eighteen, going with his father to the
[Scotch] Northern Circuit, 'kept,' he writes, 'an exact journal.'
_Letters of Boswell_, p. 8. In the autumn of 1762 he also kept a journal
which he sent to Temple to read. _Ib_. p. 19.

[1285] 'It has been well observed, that the misery of man proceeds not
from any single crush of overwhelming evil, but from small vexations
continually repeated.' Johnson's _Works_, viii. 333. 'The main of life
is indeed composed of small incidents and petty occurrences.' _Ib_. ii.
322. Dr. Franklin (_Memoirs_, i. 199) says:--'Human felicity is produced
not so much by great pieces of good fortune that seldom happen as by
little advantages that occur every day.'

[1286] Boswell wrote the next day:--'We sat till between two and three.
He took me by the hand cordially, and said, "My dear Boswell, I love you
very much." Now Temple, can I help indulging vanity?' _Letters of
Boswell_, p. 27. Fourteen years later Boswell was afraid that he kept
Johnson too late up. 'No, Sir,' said he, 'I don't care though I sit all
night with you.' _Post_, Sept. 23, 1777. See also _post_, April 7, 1779,
where Johnson, speaking of these early days, said to Boswell, 'it was
not the _wine_ that made your head ache, but the sense that I put
into it.'

[1287] Tuesday was the 19th.

[1288] 'The elder brother of the first Lord Rokeby, called long Sir
Thomas Robinson, on account of his height, and to distinguish him from
Sir Thomas Robinson, first Lord Grantham. It was on his request for an
epigram that Lord Chesterfield made the distich:--

"Unlike my subject will I make my song,
It shall be witty, and it shan't be long,"

and to whom he said in his last illness, "Ah, Sir Thomas, it will be
sooner over with me than it would be with you, for I am dying by
inches." Lord Chesterfield was very short.' CROKER. Southey, writing of
Rokeby Hall, which belonged to Robinson, says that 'Long Sir Thomas
found a portrait of Richardson in the house; thinking Mr. Richardson a
very unfit personage to be suspended in effigy among lords, ladies, and
baronets, he ordered the painter to put him on the star and blue riband,
and then christened the picture Sir Robert Walpole.' Southey's _Life_,
iii. 346. See also _ante_, p. 259 note 2, and _post_, 1770, near the end
of Dr. Maxwell's _Collectanea_.

[1289] Johnson (_Works_, vi. 440) had written of Frederick the Great in
1756:--'His skill in poetry and in the French language has been loudly
praised by Voltaire, a judge without exception if his honesty were equal
to his knowledge.' Boswell, in his _Hypochondriacks_, records a
conversation that he had with Voltaire on memory:--'I asked him if he
could give me any notion of the situation of our ideas which we have
totally forgotten at the time, yet shall afterwards recollect. He
paused, meditated a little, and acknowledged his ignorance in the spirit
of a philosophical poet by repeating as a very happy allusion a passage
in Thomson's _Seasons_--"Aye," said he, "Where sleep the winds when it
is calm?"' _London Mag_. 1783, p. 157. The passage is in Thomson's
_Winter_, l. 116:--

'In what far-distant region of the sky,
Hush'd in deep silence, sleep ye when 'tis calm?'

[1290] See _post_, ii. 54, note 3.

[1291] Bernard Lintot, the father, published Pope's _Iliad_ and
_Odyssey_. Over the sale of the _Odyssey_ a quarrel arose between the
two men. Johnson's _Works_, viii. 251, 274. Lintot is attacked in the
_Dunciad_, i. 40 and ii. 53; He was High-Sheriff for Sussex in 1736--the
year of his death. _Gent. Mag_. vi. 110. The son is mentioned in
Johnson's _Works_, viii. 282.

[1292] 'July 19, 1763. I was with Mr. Johnson to-day. I was in his
garret up four pair of stairs; it is very airy, commands a view of St.
Paul's and many a brick roof. He has many good books, but they are all
lying in confusion and dust.' _Letters of Boswell_, p. 30. On Good
Friday, 1764, Johnson made the following entry:--'I hope to put my rooms
in order: Disorder I have found one great cause of idleness.' On his
birth-day in the same year he wrote:--'To-morrow I purpose to regulate
my room.' _Pr. and Med_. pp. 50, 60.

[1293] See _ante_, p. 140, and _post_, under Sept. 9, 1779.

[1294] Afterwards Rector of Mamhead, Devonshire. He is the grandfather
of the present Bishop of London. He and Boswell had been fellow-students
at the University of Edinburgh, and seemed in youth to have had an equal
amount of conceit. 'Recollect,' wrote Boswell, 'how you and I flattered
ourselves that we were to be the greatest men of our age.' _Letters of
Boswell_, p. 159. They began to correspond at least as early as 1758.
The last letter was one from Boswell on his death-bed. Johnson thus
mentions Temple (_Works_, viii. 480):--'Gray's character I am willing to
adopt, as Mr. Mason has done, from a letter written to my friend Mr.
Boswell by the Revd. Mr. Temple, Rector of St. Gluvias in Cornwall; and
am as willing as his warmest well-wisher to believe it true.'

[1295] Johnson (_Works_, vii. 240) quotes the following by Edmund Smith,
and written some time after 1708:--'It will sound oddly to posterity,
that, in a polite nation, in an enlightened age, under the direction of
the most literary property in 1710, whether by wise, most learned, and
most generous encouragers of knowledge in the world, the property of a
mechanick should be better secured than that of a scholar! that the
poorest manual operations should be more valued than the noblest
products of the brain! that it should be felony to rob a cobbler of a
pair of shoes, and no crime to deprive the best authour of his whole
subsistence! that nothing should make a man a sure title to his own
writings but the stupidity of them!' See _post_, May 8, 1773, and Feb.7,
1774; and Boswell's _Hebrides_, Aug. 17 and 20, 1773.

[1296] The question arose, after the passing of the first statute
respecting literary property in 1710, whether by certain of its
provisions this perpetual copyright at common law was extinguished for
the future. The question was solemnly argued before the Court of King's
Bench, when Lord Mansfield presided, in 1769. The result was a decision
in favour of the common-law right as unaltered by the statute, with the
disapproval however of Mr. Justice Yates. In 1774 the same point was
brought before the House of Lords, and the decision of the court below
reversed by a majority of six judges in eleven, as Lord Mansfield, who
adhered to the opinion of the minority, declined to interfere; it being
very unusual, from motives of delicacy, for a peer to support his own
judgment on appeal to the House of Lords. _Penny Cylco_. viii. I. See
_post_, Feb. 7, 1774. Lord Shelburne, on Feb 27, 1774, humourously
describes the scene in the Lords to the Earl of Chatham:--'Lord
Mansfield showed himself the merest Captain Bobadil that, I suppose,
ever existed in real life. You can, perhaps, imagine to yourself the
Bishop of Carlyle, an old metaphysical head of a college, reading a
paper, not a speech, out of an old sermon book, with very bad sight
leaning on the table, Lord Mansfield sitting at it, with eyes of fixed
melancholy looking at him, knowing that the bishop's were the only eyes
in the House who could not meet his; the judges behind him, full of rage
at being drawn into so absurd an opinion, and abandoned in it by their
chief; the Bishops waking, as your Lordship knows they do, just before
they vote, and staring on finding something the matter; while Lord
Townshend was close to the bar, getting Mr. Dunning to put up his glass
to look at the head of criminal justice.' _Chatham Corres_. iv. 327.

[1297] See _post_ April 15 1778, note.

[1298] Dr. Franklin (_Memoirs_ iii. 178), complaining of the high prices
of English books, describes 'the excessive artifices made use of to puff
up a paper of verses into a pamphlet, a pamphlet into an octavo, and an
octavo into a quarto with white-lines, exorbitant margins, &c., to such
a degree that the selling of paper seems now the object, and printing on
it only the pretence.'

[1299] Boswell was on friendly terms with him. He wrote to Erskine on
Dec. 2, 1761:--'I am just now returned from eating a most excellent pig
with the most magnificent Donaldson.' _Boswell and Erskine
Correspondence_, p. 20.

[1300] Dr. Carlyle (_Auto_. p. 516) says that Lord Mansfield this year
(1769) 'talking of Hume and Robertson's _Histories_, said that though he
could point out few or no faults in them, yet, when he was reading their
books, he did not think he was reading English.' See _post_, ii. 72, for
Hume's Scotticisms. Hume went to France in 1734 when he was 23 years old
and stayed there three years. Hume's _Autobiography_, p. vii. He never
mastered French colloquially. Lord Charlemont, who met him in Turin in
1748, says:--'His speech in English was rendered ridiculous by the
broadest Scotch accent, and his French was, if possible, still more
laughable.' Hardy's _Charlemont_, i. 15. Horace Walpole, who met him in
Paris in 1765, writes (_Letters_, iv. 426):--'Mr. Hume is the only thing
in the world that they [the French] believe implicitly; which they must
do, for I defy them to understand any language that he speaks.' Gibbon
(_Misc. Works_, i. 122) says of Hume's writings:--'Their careless
inimitable beauties often forced me to close the volume with a mixed
sensation of delight and despair.' Dr. Beattie (_Life_, p. 243) wrote on
Jan. 5, 1778:--'We who live in Scotland are obliged to study English
from books, like a dead language, which we understand, but cannot
speak.' He adds:--'I have spent some years in labouring to acquire the
art of giving a vernacular cast to the English we write.' Dr. A. Carlyle
(_Auto_, p. 222) says:--'Since we began to affect speaking a foreign
language, which the English dialect is to us, humour, it must be
confessed, is less apparent in conversation.'

[1301] _Discours sur L'origine et les fondemens de l'inégalité parmi les
hommes_, 1754.

[1302] 'I have indeed myself observed that my banker ever bows lowest to
me when I wear my full-bottomed wig, and writes me Mr. or Esq.,
accordingly as he sees me dressed.' _Spectator_, No. 150.

[1303] Mr. Croker, quoting Mr. Wright, says:--'_See his Quantulumanque_
(sic) _concerning Money_.' I have read Petty's _Quantulumcunque_, but do
not find the passage in it.

[1304] Johnson told Dr. Burney that Goldsmith said, when he first began
to write, he determined to commit to paper nothing but what was _new_;
but he afterwards found that what was _new_ was false, and from that
time was no longer solicitous about novelty. BURNEY. Mr. Forster (_Life
of Goldsmith_, i. 421) says that this note 'is another instance of the
many various and doubtful forms in which stories about Johnson and
Goldsmith are apt to appear when once we lose sight of the trustworthy
Boswell. This is obviously a mere confused recollection of what is
correctly told by Boswell [_post_, March 26, 1779].' There is much truth
in Mr. Forster's general remark: nevertheless Burney likely enough
repeated to the best of his memory what he had himself heard
from Johnson.

[1305] 'Their [the ancient moralists'] arguments have been, indeed, so
unsuccessful, that I know not whether it can be shewn, that by all the
wit and reason which this favourite cause has called forth a single
convert was ever made; that even one man has refused to be rich, when to
be rich was in his power, from the conviction of the greater happiness
of a narrow fortune.' Johnson's _Works_, ii. 278. See _post_, June 3,
1781, and June 3, Sept. 7, and Dec. 7, 1782.

[1306] Johnson (_Works_, vi. 440) shows how much Frederick owed to 'the
difficulties of his youth.' 'Kings, without this help from temporary
infelicity, see the world in a mist, which magnifies everything near
them, and bounds their view to a narrow compass, which few are able to
extend by the mere force of curiosity.' He next points out what Cromwell
'owed to the private condition in which he first entered the world;' and
continues:--'The King of Prussia brought to the throne the knowledge of
a private man, without the guilt of usurpation. Of this general
acquaintance with the world there may be found some traces in his whole
life. His conversation is like that of other men upon common topicks,
his letters have an air of familiar elegance, and his whole conduct is
that of a man who has to do with men.'

[1307] See _ante_ p. 408

[1308] See _ante_, p. 298.

[1309] That this was Mr. Dempster seems likely from the _Letters of
Boswell_ (p. 34), where Boswell says:--'I had prodigious satisfaction to
find Dempster's sophistry (which he has learnt from Hume and Rousseau)
vanquished by the solid sense and vigorous reasoning of Johnson.
Dempster,' he continues, 'was as happy as a vanquished argumentator
could be.' The character of the 'benevolent good man' suits Dempster
(see _post_, under Feb. 7, 1775, where Boswell calls him 'the virtuous
and candid Dempster'), while that of the 'noted infidel writer' suits
Hume. We find Boswell, Johnson, and Dempster again dining together on
May 9, 1772.

[1310]

'Thou wilt at best but suck a bull,
Or sheer swine, all cry and no wool.'

_Hudibras_, Part i. Canto I. 1. 851.

Dr. Z. Grey, in his note on these lines, quotes the proverbial saying
'As wise as the Waltham calf that went nine times to suck a bull.' He
quotes also from _The Spectator_, No. 138, the passage where the Cynic
said of two disputants, 'One of these fellows is milking a ram, and the
other holds the pail.'

[1311] The writer of the article _Vacuum_ in the _Penny Cyclo_. (xxvi.
76), quoting Johnson's words, adds:--'That is, either all space is full
of matter, or there are parts of space which have no matter. The
alternative is undeniable, and the inference to which the modern
philosophy would give the greatest probablility is, that all space is
full of matter in the common sense of the word, but really occupied by
particles of matter with vacuous interstices.'

[1312] 'When any one tells me that he saw a dead man restored to life, I
immediately consider with myself, whether it be more probable that this
person should either deceive or be deceived, or that the fact which he
relates should really have happened.' Humes _Essay on Miracles_, Part i.
See _post_ Sept. 22 1777, where Boswell again quoted this passage.

[1313] A coffee-house over against Catherine Street, now the site of a
tourists' ticket office. _Athenaeum_, No. 3041.

[1314] Stockdale records (_Memoirs_, i. 202) that Johnson once said to
him:--'Whenever it is the duty of a young and old man to act at the same
time with a spirit of independence and generosity; we may always have
reason to hope that the young man will ardently perform, and to fear
that the old man will desert, his duty.'

[1315] Boswell thus writes of this evening:--'I learn more from him than
from any man I ever was with. He told me a very odd thing, that he knew
at eighteen as much as he does now; that is to say, his judgment is much
stronger, but he had then stored up almost all the facts he has now, and
he says that he has led but an idle life; only think, Temple, of that!'
_Letters of Boswell_, p. 34. See _ante_, p. 56, and _post_, ii. 36. He
told Windham in 1784 'that he read Latin with as much ease when he went
to college as at present.' Windham's _Diary_, p. 17.

[1316] Johnson in 1739 wrote of 'those distempers and depressions, from
which students, not well acquainted with the constitution of the human
body, sometimes fly for relief to wine instead of exercise, and purchase
temporary ease, by the hazard of the most dreadful consequences.'
_Works_, vi. 271. In _The Rambler_, No. 85, he says:--'How much
happiness is gained, and how much misery is escaped, by frequent and
violent agitation of the body.' Boswell records (_Hebrides_, Sept. 24,
1773):--'Dr. Johnson told us at breakfast, that he rode harder at a
fox-chace than anybody.' Mrs. Piozzi (_Anec_. p. 206) says:--'He
certainly rode on Mr. Thrale's old hunter with a good firmness, and,
though he would follow the hounds fifty miles an end sometimes, would
never own himself either tired or amused. I think no praise ever went so
close to his heart, as when Mr. Hamilton called out one day upon
Brighthelmstone Downs, "Why Johnson rides as well, for aught I see, as
the most illiterate fellow in England."' He wrote to Mrs. Thrale in
1777:--'No season ever was finer. Barley, malt, beer and money. There is
the series of ideas. The deep logicians call it a _sorites_. _I hope my
master will no longer endure the reproach of not keeping me a horse_.'
_Piozzi Letters_, i. 360. See _post_, March 19 and 28, 1776, Sept. 20,
1777, and Nov. 21, 1778.

[1317] This _one_ Mrs. Macaulay was the same personage who afterwards
made herself so much known as 'the celebrated female historian.'
BOSWELL. Hannah More (_Memoirs_, i. 234) tells the following story of
Mrs. Macaulay's daughter:--'Desirous from civility to take some notice
of her, and finding she was reading _Shakespeare_, I asked her if she
was not delighted with many parts of _King John_. "I never read the
_Kings_, ma'am," was the truly characteristic reply.' See _post_, April
13, 1773, and May 15, 1776.

[1318] This speech was perhaps suggested to Johnson by the following
passage in _The Government of the Tongue_ (p. 106)--a book which he
quotes in his _Dictionary_:--'Lycurgus once said to one who importuned
him to establish a popular parity in the state, "Do thou," says he,
"begin it first in thine own family."'

[1319] The first volume was published in 1756, the second in 1782.

[1320] Warton, to use his own words, 'did not think Pope at the head of
his profession. In other words, in that species of poetry wherein Pope
excelled, he is superior to all mankind; and I only say that this
species of poetry is not the most excellent one of the art.' He disposes
the English poets in four classes, placing in the first only Spenser,
Shakespeare, and Milton. 'In the second class should be ranked such as
possessed the true poetical genius in a more moderate degree, but who
had noble talents for moral, ethical, and panegyrical poetry.' In this
class, in his concluding volume, he says, 'we may venture to assign Pope
a place, just above Dryden. Yet, to bring our minds steadily to make
this decision, we must forget, for a moment, the divine _Music Ode of
Dryden_; and may, perhaps, then be compelled to confess that though
Dryden be the greater genius, yet Pope is the better artist.' Warton's
_Essay_, i. i, vii. and ii. 404. See _post_, March 31, 1772.

[1321] Mr. Croker believes Joseph Warton was meant. His father, however,
had been Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, and was afterwards Vicar of
Basingstoke and Cobham, and Professor of Poetry in his own University,
so that the son could scarcely be described as being 'originally poor.'
It is, no doubt, after Boswell's fashion to introduce in consecutive
paragraphs the same person once by name and once anonymously; but then
the 'certain author who disgusted Boswell by his forwardness,' mentioned
just before Warton, may be Warton himself.

[1322] 'When he arrived at Eton he could not make a verse; that is, he
wanted a point indispensable with us to a certain rank in our system.
But this wonderful boy, having satisfied the Master [Dr. Barnard] that
he was an admirable scholar, and possessed of genius, was at once placed
at the head of a form. He acquired the rules of Latin verse; tried his
powers; and perceiving that he could not rise above his rivals in
Virgil, Ovid, or the lyric of Horace, he took up the _sermoni propiora_,
and there overshadowed all competitors. In the following lines he
describes the hammer of the auctioneer with a mock sublimity which turns
Horace into Virgil:--

'Jam-jamque cadit, celerique recursu
Erigitur, lapsum retrahens, perque aera nutat.'

Nichols's _Lit. Anec_. viii. 547.

Horace Walpole wrote of him in Sept. 1765 (_Letters_, iv. 411):--'He is
a very extraordinary young man for variety of learning. He is rather too
wise for his age, and too fond of showing it; but when he has seen more
of the world, he will choose to know less.' He died at Rome in the
following year. Hume, on hearing the news, wrote to Adam Smith:--'Were
you and I together, dear Smith, we should shed tears at present for the
death of poor Sir James Macdonald. We could not possibly have suffered a
greater loss than in that valuable young man.' J. H. Burton's _Hume_,
ii. 349. See Boswell's _Hebrides_, Sept. 5, 1773.

[1323] Boswell says that Macdonald had for Johnson 'a _great_ terrour.'
(_Boswelliana_, p. 216.) Northcote (_Life of Reynolds_, i. 329)
says:--'It is a fact that a certain nobleman, an intimate friend of
Reynolds, had strangely conceived in his mind such a formidable idea of
all those persons who had gained great fame as literary characters, that
I have heard Sir Joshua say, he verily believed he could no more have
prevailed upon this noble person to dine at the same table with Johnson
and Goldsmith than with two tigers.' According to Mr. Seward
(_Biographiana_, p. 600), Mrs. Cotterell having one day asked Dr.
Johnson to introduce her to a celebrated writer, 'Dearest madam,' said
he, 'you had better let it alone; the best part of every author is in
general to be found in his book, I assure you.' Mr. Seward refers to
_The Rambler_, No. 14, where Johnson says that 'there has often been
observed a manifest and striking contrariety between the life of an
authour and his writings.'

[1324] See _post_, Jan. 19, 1775. In his _Hebrides_ (p. i) Boswell
writes:--'When I was at Ferney, in 1764, I mentioned our design to
Voltaire. He looked at me as if I had talked of going to the North Pole,
and said, "You do not insist on my accompanying you?" "No, Sir." "Then I
am very willing you should go."'

[1325] 'When he went through the streets he desired to have one to lead
him by the hand. They asked his opinion of the high church. He answered
that it was a large rock, yet there were some in St. Kilda much higher,
but that these were the best caves he ever saw; for that was the idea
which he conceived of the pillars and arches upon which the church
stands.' M. Martin's _Western Isles_, p. 297. Mr. Croker compares the
passage in _The Spectator_ (No. 50), in which an Indian king is made to
say of St. Paul's:--'It was probably at first an huge misshapen rock
that grew upon the top of the hill, which the natives of the country
(after having cut it into a kind of regular figure) bored and hollowed
with incredible pains and industry.'

[1326] Boswell, writing to Temple the next day, slightly varies these
words:--'He said, "My dear Boswell, it would give me great pain to part
with you, if I thought we were not to meet again."' _Letters of
Boswell_, p. 34.

[1327] Gibbon (_Misc. Works_, i. 43) protests against 'the trite and
lavish praise of the happiness of our boyish years, which is echoed with
so much affectation in the world. That happiness I have never known,
that time I have never regretted. The poet may gaily describe the short
hours of recreation; but he forgets the daily tedious labours of the
school, which is approached each morning with anxious and reluctant
steps.' See _ante_, p. 44, and _post_, under Feb. 27, 1772.

[1328] About fame Gibbon felt much as Johnson did. 'I am disgusted,' he
wrote (_ib_. 272), 'with the affectation of men of letters, who complain
that they have renounced a substance for a shadow, and that their fame
(which sometimes is no insupportable weight) affords a poor compensation
for envy, censure, and persecution. My own experience, at least, has
taught me a very different lesson; twenty happy years have been animated
by the labour of my _History_, and its success has given me a name, a
rank, a character, in the world, to which I should not otherwise have
been entitled.'

[1329] See _ante_, p. 432.

[1330] See _ante_, p. 332.

[1331] This opinion was given by him more at large at a subsequent
period. See _Journal of a Tour of the Hebrides_, 3rd edit. p. 32 [Aug.
16]. BOSWELL. 'That Swift was its author, though it be universally
believed, was never owned by himself, nor very well proved by any
evidence; but no other claimant can be produced, and he did not deny it
when Archbishop Sharpe and the Duchess of Somerset, by showing it to the
Queen, debarred him from a bishoprick.' Johnson's _Works_, viii. 197.
See also _post_, March 24, 1775. Stockdale records (_Memoirs_, ii. 61)
that Johnson said 'that if Swift really was the author of _The Tale of
the Tub_, as the best of his other performances were of a very inferior
merit, he should have hanged himself after he had written it.' Scott
(_Life of Swift_, ed. 1834, p. 77) says:--'Mrs. Whiteway observed the
Dean, in the latter years of his life [in 1735], looking over the
_Tale_, when suddenly closing the book he muttered, in an unconscious
soliloquy, "Good God! what a genius I had when I wrote that book!" She
begged it of him, who made some excuse at the moment; but on her
birthday he presented her with it inscribed, "From her affectionate
cousin." On observing the inscription, she ventured to say, "I wish,
Sir, you had said the gift of the author!" The Dean bowed, smiled
good-humouredly, and answered, "No, I thank you," in a very significant
manner.' There is this to be said of Johnson's incredulity about the
_Tale of a Tub_, that the _History of John Bull_ and the _Memoirs of
Martinus Scriblerus_, though both by Arbuthnot, were commonly assigned
to Swift and are printed in his _Works_.

[1332] 'Thomson thinks in a peculiar train, and he thinks always as a
man of genius; he looks round on Nature and on Life with the eye which
Nature bestows only on a poet;--the eye that distinguishes in everything
presented to its view whatever there is on which imagination can delight
to be detained, and with a mind that at once comprehends the vast, and
attends to the minute.' Johnson's _Works_, viii. 377. See _post_, ii.
63, and April 11, 1776.

[1333] Burke seems to be meant. See _post_, April 25, 1778, and
Boswell's _Hebrides_, Aug. 15, and Sept. 15, 1773.--It is strange
however that, while in these three places Boswell mentions Burke's name,
he should leave a blank here. In _Boswelliana_, p. 328, Boswell
records:--'Langton said Burke hammered his wit upon an anvil, and the
iron was cold. There were no sparks flashing and flying all about.'

[1334] In _Boswelliana_ (p. 214) this anecdote is thus given:--'Boswell
was talking to Mr. Samuel Johnson of Mr. Sheridan's enthusiasm for the
advancement of eloquence. "Sir," said Mr. Johnson, "it won't do. He
cannot carry through his scheme. He is like a man attempting to stride
the English Channel. Sir, the cause bears no proportion to the effect.
It is setting up a candle at Whitechapel to give light at Westminster."'
See also _ante_, p. 385, and _post_. Oct. 16, 1969, April 18 and May

no more to furnish out a volume.' Swift's _Works_, ed. 1803, xvi. 197.
Lord Chesterfield wrote from Paris in 1741:--'They [the Parisians]
despise us, and with reason, for our ill-breeding; on the other hand, we
despite them for their want of learning, and we are in the right of it.'

[1337] 'Dr. Johnson said that he had been told by an acquaintance of Sir
Isaac Newton, that in early life he started as a clamorous infidel.'
Seward's _Anecdotes_, ii. 324. In Brewster's _Life of Newton_ I find no
mention of early infidelity. On the contrary, Newton had been described
as one who 'had been a searcher of the Scriptures from his youth' (ii.
314). Brewster says that 'some foreign writers have endeavoured to shew
that his theological writings were composed at a late period of life,
when his mind was in its dotage.' It was not so, however. _Ib_. p. 315.

[1338] I fully intended to have followed advice of such weight; but
having staid much longer both in Germany and Italy than I proposed to
do, and having also visited Corsica, I found that I had exceeded the
time allowed me by my father, and hastened to France in my way
homewards. BOSWELL. See _ante_, p. 410.

'Has heaven reserved, in pity to the poor,
No pathless waste, or undiscovered shore?
No secret island in the boundless main?
No peaceful desert, yet unclaimed by Spain?'

Johnson looked upon the discovery of America as a misfortune to mankind.
In _Taxation no Tyranny_ (_Works_, vi. 233) he says that 'no part of the
world has yet had reason to rejoice that Columbus found at last
reception and employment. In the same year, in a year hitherto
disastrous to mankind, by the Portuguese was discovered the passage of
the Indies, and by the Spaniards the coast of America.' On March 4,
1773, he wrote (Croker's _Boswell_, p. 248):--'I do not much wish well
to discoveries, for I am always afraid they will end in conquest and
robbery.' See _ante_, p. 308, note 2, and post, March 21, 1775, and
under Dec. 24, 1783.

'Thus the soft gifts of sleep conclude the day,
And stretched on bulks, as usual, poets lay.'

_The Dunciad_, ii. 420.

In _Humphry Clinker_, in the Letter of June 10, in which is described
the dinner given by S---- to the poor authors, of one of them it is
said:--'The only secret which he ever kept was the place of his
lodgings; but it was believed that during the heats of summer he
commonly took his repose upon a bulk.' Johnson defines _bulk_ as _a part
of a building jutting out_.

[1346] 'Knowledge is certainly one of the means of pleasure, as is
confessed by the natural desire which every mind feels of increasing its
ideas ... without knowing why we always rejoice when we learn, and
grieve when we forget.' _Rasselas_, ch. xi.

[1347] In the days of Old London Bridge, as Mr. Croker points out, even
when the tide would have allowed passengers to shoot it, those who were
prudent landed above the bridge, and walked to some wharf below it.

[1348] All who are acquainted with the history of religion, (the most
important, surely, that concerns the human mind,) know that the
appellation of Methodists was first given to a society of students in
the University of Oxford, who about the year 1730 were distinguished by
an earnest and _methodical_ attention to devout exercises. This
disposition of mind is not a novelty, or peculiar to any sect, but has
been, and still may be found, in many christians of every denomination.
Johnson himself was, in a dignified manner, a Methodist. In his
_Rambler_, No. 110, he mentions with respect 'the whole discipline of
regulated piety;' and in his _Prayers and Meditations_, many instances
occur of his anxious examination into his spiritual state. That this
religious earnestness, and in particular an observation of the influence
of the Holy Spirit, has sometimes degenerated into folly, and sometimes
been counterfeited for base purposes, cannot be denied. But it is not,
therefore, fair to decry it when genuine. The principal argument in
reason and good sense against methodism is, that it tends to debase
human nature, and prevent the generous exertions of goodness, by an
unworthy supposition that GOD will pay no regard to them; although it is
positively said in the scriptures that He 'will reward every man
according to his works.' [St. Matthew xvi. 27.] But I am happy to have
it [in] my power to do justice to those whom it is the fashion to
ridicule, without any knowledge of their tenets; and this I can do by
quoting a passage from one of their best apologists, Mr. Milner, who
thus expresses their doctrine upon this subject. 'Justified by faith,
renewed in his faculties, and constrained by the love of Christ, their
believer moves in the sphere of love and gratitude, and all his _duties_
flow more or less from this principle. And though _they are accumulating
for him in heaven a treasure of bliss proportioned to his faithfulness
and activity, and it is by no means inconsistent with his principles to
feel the force of this consideration_, yet love itself sweetens every
duty to his mind; and he thinks there is no absurdity in his feeling the
love of GOD as the grand commanding principle of his life.' _Essays on
several religious Subjects, &c., by Joseph Milner, A.M., Master of the
Grammar School of Kingston upon-Hull, 1789, p_. 11. BOSWELL. Southey
(_Life of Wesley_, i. 41), mentioning the names given at Oxford to
Wesley and his followers, continues:--'One person with less irreverence
and more learning observed, in reference to their methodical manner of
life, that a new sect of Methodists was sprung up, alluding to the
ancient school of physicians known by that name.' Wesley, in 1744, wrote
_The Humble Address to the King of the Societies in derision called
Methodists. Journal_, i. 437. He often speaks of 'the people called
Methodists,' but sometimes he uses the term without any qualification.
Mrs. Thrale, in 1780, wrote to Johnson:--'Methodist is considered always
a term of reproach, I trust, because I never yet did hear that any one
person called himself a Methodist.' _Piozzi Letters_, ii. 119.

[1349] Wesley said:--'We should constantly use the most common, little,
easy words (so they are pure and proper) which our language affords.
When first I talked at Oxford to plain people in the Castle [the prison]
or the town, I observed they gaped and stared. This quickly obliged me
to alter my style, and adopt the language of those I spoke to; and yet
there is a dignity in their simplicity, which is not disagreeable to
those of the highest rank.' Southey's _Wesley_, i. 431. See _post_,
1770, in Dr. Maxwell's _Collectanea_, Oct. 12, 1779, Aug. 30, 1780, and
Boswell's _Hebrides_, Nov. 10, 1773.

[1354] Boswell said of Paoli's talk about great men:--'I regret that the
fire with which he spoke upon such occasions so dazzled me, that I could
not recollect his sayings, so as to write them down when I retired from
his presence.' _Corsica_, p. 197.

[1355] More passages than one in Boswell's _Letters to Temple_ shew this
absence of relish. Thus in 1775 he writes:--'I perceive some dawnings of
taste for the country' (p. 216); and again:--'I will force a taste for
natural beauties' (p. 219).

experience of sprightly and elegant life, inherits, with the beautiful
family Domain, no inconsiderable share of that love of literature, which
distinguished his venerable grandfather, the Bishop of Carlisle. He one
day observed to me, of Dr. Johnson, in a felicity of phrase, 'There is a
blunt dignity about him on every occasion.' BOSWELL.

[1359] Wordsworth's lines to the Baronet's daughter, Lady Fleming, might
be applied to the father:--

'Lives there a man whose sole delights
Are trivial pomp and city noise,
Hardening a heart that loathes or slights
What every natural heart enjoys?'

Wordsworth's _Poems_, iv. 338.

college of Civilians in London, who practised in the Ecclesiastical
Courts and the Court of the Admiralty. See Boswell's _Hebrides_,

[1361] He repeated this advice on the death of Boswell's father, _post_,
Sept. 7, 1782.

[1365] Boswell wrote to Temple on July 28, 1763:--'My departure fills me
with a kind of gloom that quite overshadows my mind. I could almost weep
to think of leaving dear London, and the calm retirement of the Inner
Temple. This is very effeminate and very young, but I cannot help it.'
_Letters of Boswell_, p. 46.

[1366] Mrs. Piozzi says (_Anec_. p. 297) that 'Johnson's eyes were so
wild, so piercing, and at times so fierce, that fear was, I believe, the
first emotion in the hearts of all his beholders.'

[1367] Johnson was, in fact, the editor of this work, as appears from a
letter of Mr. T. Davies to the Rev. Edm. Bettesworth:--'Reverend Sir,--I
take the liberty to send you Roger Ascham's works in English. Though Mr.
Bennet's name is in the title, the editor was in reality Mr. Johnson,
the author of the _Rambler_, who wrote the life of the author, and added
several notes. Mr. Johnson gave it to Mr. Bennet, for his advantage,'
&c.--CROKER. Very likely Davies exaggerated Johnson's share in the book.
Bennet's edition was published, not in 1763, but in 1761.

[1368] 'Lord Sheffield describes the change in Gibbon's opinions caused
by the reign of terror:--'He became a warm and zealous advocate for
every sort of old establishment. I recollect in a circle where French
affairs were the topic and some Portuguese present, he, seemingly with
seriousness, argued in favour of the Inquisition at Lisbon, and said he
would not, at the present moment, give up even that old establishment.'
_Gibbons's Misc. Works_, i. 328. One of Gibbon's correspondents told him
in 1792, that the _Wealth of Nations_ had been condemned by the
Inquisition on account of 'the lowness of its style and the looseness of
the morals which it inculcates.' _Ib_. ii. 479. See also _post_, May
7, 1773.

[1369] Johnson wrote on Aug. 17, 1773:--'This morning I saw at breakfast
Dr. Blacklock, the blind poet, who does not remember to have seen light,
and is read to by a poor scholar in Latin, Greek, and French. He was
originally a poor scholar himself. I looked on him with reverence.'
_Piozzi Letters_, i. 110. See also Boswell's _Hebrides_, Aug. 17, 1773.
Spence published an _Account of Blacklock_, in which he meanly omitted
any mention of Hume's great generosity to the blind poet. J. H. Burton's
_Hume_, i. 392. Hume asked Blacklock whether he connected colour and
sound. 'He answered, that as he met so often with the terms expressing
colours, he had formed some false associations, but that they were of
the intellectual kind. The illumination of the sun, for instance, he
supposed to resemble the presence of a friend.' _Ib_. p. 389.

[1370] They left London early and yet they travelled only 51 miles that
day. The whole distance to Harwich is 71 miles. Paterson's
_Itinerary_, i. 323.

[1371] Mackintosh (_Life_, ii. 162) writing of the time of William III,
says that 'torture was legal in Scotland, and familiar in every country
of Europe but England. Was there a single writer at that time who had
objected to torture? I think not.' In the _Gent. Mag_. for 1742 (p. 660)
it is stated that 'the King of Prussia has forbid the use of torture in
his dominions.' In 1747 (p. 298) we read that Dr. Blackwell, an English
physician, had been put to the torture in Sweden. Montesquieu in the
_Esprit des Lois_, vi. 17, published in 1748, writing of 'la question ou
torture centre les criminels,' says:--'Nous voyons aujourd'hui une
nation très-bien policée [la nation anglaise] la rejeter sans
inconvénient. Elle n'est donc pas nécessaire par sa nature.' Boswell in
1765 found that Paoli tortured a criminal with fire. _Corsica_, p. 158.
Voltaire, in 1777, after telling how innocent men had been put to death
with torture in the reign of Lewis XIV, continues--'Mais un roi a-t-il
le temps de songer à ces menus details d'horreurs au milieu de ses
fètes, de ses conquêtes, et de ses mattresses? Daignez vous en occuper,
ô Louis XVI, vous qui n'avez aucune de ces distractions!' Voltaire's
_Works_, xxvi. 332. Johnson, two years before Voltaire thus wrote, had
been shown _la chambre de question_--the torture-chamber-_in Paris_.
_Post_, Oct. 17, 1775. It was not till the Revolution that torture was
abolished in France. One of the Scotch judges in 1793, at the trial of
Messrs. Palmer and Muir for sedition (_post_, June 3, 1781, note),
'asserted that now the torture was banished, there was no adequate
punishment for sedition.' _Parl. Hist_. xxx. 1569.

[1372] 'A cheerful and good heart will have a care of his meat and
drink.' _Ecclesiasticus_, xxx. 25.

Nam ibi de divinis atque humanis cernitur.'
   _Trinummus_, act 2, sc. 4.

Mrs. Piozzi (_Anec_. p. 149) records that 'Johnson often said, "that
wherever the dinner is ill got, there is poverty, or there is avarice,
or there is stupidity; in short, the family is somehow grossly wrong;
for," continued he, "a man seldom thinks with more earnestness of
anything than he does of his dinner; and if he cannot get that well
dressed, he should be suspected of inaccuracy in other things."' Yet he
'used to say that a man who rode out for an appetite consulted but
little the dignity of human nature.' Johnson's _Works_ (1787), xi. 204.

[1373] This essay is more against the practices of the parasite than
gulosity. It is entitled _The art of living at the cost of others_.
Johnson wrote to one of Mrs. Thrale's children:--'Gluttony is, I think,
less common among women than among men. Women commonly eat more
sparingly, and are less curious in the choice of meat; but if once you
find a woman gluttonous, expect from her very little virtue. Her mind is
enslaved to the lowest and grossest temptation.' _Piozzi Letters_,
ii. 298.

[1374] Hawkins (_Life_, p. 355) mentions 'the greediness with which he
ate, his total inattention to those among whom he was seated, and his
profound silence at the moment of refection.'

[1375] Cumberland (_Memoirs_, i. 357) says:--'He fed heartily, but not
voraciously, and was extremely courteous in his commendations of any
dish that pleased his palate.'

[1376] Johnson wrote to Mrs. Thrale on July 10, 1780:--'Last week I saw
flesh but twice and I think fish once; the rest was pease. You are
afraid, you say, lest I extenuate myself too fast, and are an enemy to
violence; but did you never hear nor read, dear Madam, that every man
has his _genius_, and that the great rule by which all excellence is
attained and all success procured, is to follow _genius_; and have you
not observed in all our conversations that my _genius_ is always in
extremes; that I am very noisy or very silent; very gloomy or very
merry; very sour or very kind? And would you have me cross my _genius_
when it leads me sometimes to voracity and sometimes to abstinence?'
_Piozzi Letters_, ii. 166.

[1377] 'This,' he told Boswell, 'was no intentional fasting, but
happened just in the course of a literary life.' Boswell's _Hebrides_,
Oct. 4, 1773. See _post_, April 17, 1778.

[1378] In the last year of his life, when he knew that his appetite was
diseased, he wrote to Mrs. Thrale:--'I have now an inclination to luxury
which even your table did not excite; _for till now my talk was more
about the dishes than my thoughts_. I remember you commended me for
seeming pleased with my dinners when you had reduced your table; I am
able to tell you with great veracity, that I never knew when the
reduction began, nor should have known what it was made, had not you
told me. _I now think and consult to-day what I shall eat to-morrow.
This disease will, I hope, be cured_.' _Piozzi Letters_, ii. 362.

[1379] Johnson's visit to Gordon and Maclaurin are just mentioned in
Boswell's _Hebrides_, under Nov. 11, 1772.

[1380] The only nobleman with whom he dined 'about the same time' was
Lord Elibank. After dining with him, 'he supped,' says Boswell, 'with my
wife and myself.' _Ib_.

[1381] See _post_, April 15, 1778.

[1382] Mrs. Piozzi (_Anec_. p. 102) says, 'Johnson's own notions about
eating were nothing less than delicate; a leg of pork boiled till it
dropped from the bone, a veal-pie with plums and sugar, or the outside
cut of a salt buttock of beef were his favourite dainties.' Cradock saw
Burke at a tavern dinner send Johnson a very small piece of a pie, the
crust of which was made with bad butter. 'Johnson soon returned his
plate for more. Burke exclaimed:--"I am glad that you are able so well
to relish this pie." Johnson, not at all pleased that what he ate should
ever be noticed, retorted:--"There is a time of life, Sir, when a man
requires the repairs of a table."' Cradock's _Memoirs_, i. 229. A
passage in Baretti's _Italy_, ii. 316, seems to show that English eating
in general was not delicate. 'I once heard a Frenchman swear,' he
writes, 'that he hated the English, "parce qu'ils versent du beurre
fondu sur leur veau rod."'

[1383] 'He had an abhorrence of affectation,' said Mr. Langton. _Post_,
1780, in Mr. Langton's _Collection_.

[1384] At college he would not let his companions say _prodigious_.
_Post_, April 17, 1778.

[1385] See _post_, Sept. 19, 1777, and 1780 in Mr. Langton's
_Collection_. Dugald Stewart quotes a saying of Turgot:--'He who had
never doubted of the existence of matter might be assured he had no turn
for metaphysical disquisitions.' _Life of Reid_, p. 416.

'Not when a gilt buffet's reflected pride
Turns you from sound philosophy aside.'

Pope's _Satires_, ii. 5.

[1388] Mackintosh (_Life_, i. 71) said that 'Burke's treatise on the
_Sublime and Beautiful_ is rather a proof that his mind was not formed
for pure philosophy; and if we may believe Boswell that it was once the
intention of Mr. Burke to have written against Berkeley, we may be
assured that he would not have been successful in answering that great
speculator; or, to speak more correctly, that he could not have
discovered the true nature of the questions in dispute, and thus have
afforded the only answer consistent with the limits of the human
faculties.'

[1389] Goldsmith's _Retaliation_.

[1390] I have the following autograph letter written by Johnson to Dr.
Taylor three weeks after Boswell's departure.

'DEAR SIR,

'Having with some impatience reckoned upon hearing from you these two
last posts, and been disappointed, I can form to myself no reason for
the omission but your perturbation of mind, or disorder of body arising
from it, and therefore I once more advise removal from Ashbourne as the
proper remedy both for the cause and the effect.

'You perhaps ask, whither should I go? any whither where your case is
not known, and where your presence will cause neither looks nor
whispers. Where you are the necessary subject of common talk, you will
not safely be at rest.

'If you cannot conveniently write to me yourself let somebody write for
you to

'Dear Sir,

'Your most affectionate,

'SAM. JOHNSON.

'August 25, 1763.

'To the Reverend Dr. Taylor
           in Ashbourne,
                 Derbyshire.'

Five other letters on the same subject are given in _Notes and Queries_,
6th S. v. pp. 324, 342, 382. Taylor and his wife 'never lived very well
together' (p. 325), and at last she left him. On May 22nd of the next
year Johnson congratulated Taylor 'upon the happy end of so vexatious an
affair, the happyest [sic] that could be next to reformation and
reconcilement' (p. 382). Taylor did not follow the advice to leave
Ashbourne; for on Sept. 3 Johnson wrote to him:--'You seem to be so well
pleased to be where you are, that I shall not now press your removal;
but do not believe that every one who rails at your wife wishes well to
you. A small country town is not the place in which one would chuse to
quarrel with a wife; every human being in such places is a spy.'
_Ib_. p. 343.

[1391] According to Mrs. Piozzi (_Anec_. p. 210) he was accompanied by
his black servant Frank. 'I must have you know, ladies,' said he, 'that
Frank has carried the empire of Cupid further than most men. When I was
in Lincolnshire so many years ago he attended me thither; and when we
returned home together, I found that a female haymaker had followed him
to London for love.' If this story is generally true, it bears the mark
of Mrs. Piozzi's usual inaccuracy. The visit was paid early in the year,
and was over in February; what haymakers were there at that season?

[1392] Boswell by his quotation marks refers, I think, to his
_Hebrides_, Oct. 24, 1773, where Johnson says:--'Nobody, at times, talks
more laxly than I do.' See also _post_, ii. 73.

[1393] See _post_, April 26, 1776, for old Mr. Langton's slowness of
understanding.

[1394] See _ante_, i. 320.

[1395] Mr. Best (_Memorials_, p. 65) thus writes of a visit to
Langton:--'We walked to the top of a very steep hill behind the house.
Langton said, "Poor dear Dr. Johnson, when he came to this spot, turned
back to look down the hill, and said he was determined to take a roll
down. When we understood what he meant to do, we endeavoured to dissuade
him; but he was resolute, saying, he had not had a roll for a long time;
and taking out of his lesser pockets whatever might be in them, and
laying himself parallel with the edge of the hill, he actually
descended, turning himself over and over till he came to the bottom."
This story was told with such gravity, and with an air of such
affectionate remembrance of a departed friend, that it was impossible to
suppose this extraordinary freak an invention of Mr. Langton.' It must
have been in the winter that he had this roll.

[1396] Boswell himself so calls it in a Mr. letter to Temple written
three or four months after Garrick's death, _Letters of Boswell_, p.
242. See also Boswell's _Hebrides_, Aug. 25, 1773.

[1397] Malone says:--'Reynolds was the original founder of our Literary
Club about the year 1762, the first thought of which he started to Dr.
Johnson at his own fireside.' Prior's _Malone_, p. 434. Mrs. Piozzi
(_Anec_. p. 122) says:--'Johnson called Reynolds their Romulus, or said
somebody else of the company called him so, which was more likely.'
According to Hawkins (_Life_, p. 425) the Club was founded in the winter
of 1763, i.e. 1763-4.

[1398] Dr. Nugent, a physician, was Burke's father-in-law. Macaulay
(_Essays_, i. 407) says:--'As we close Boswell's book, the club-room is
before us, and the table on which stands the omelet for Nugent, and the
lemons for Johnson.' It was from Mrs. Piozzi that Macaulay learnt of the
omelet. Nugent was a Roman Catholic, and it was on Friday that the Club
before long came to meet. We may assume that he would not on that day
eat meat. 'I fancy,' Mrs. Piozzi writes (_Anec_. p. 122), 'Dr. Nugent
ordered an omelet sometimes on a Friday or Saturday night; for I
remember Mr. Johnson felt very painful sensations at the sight of that
dish soon after his death, and cried:--"Ah my poor dear friend! I shall
never eat omelet with _thee_ again!" quite in an agony.' Dr. Nugent, in
the imaginary college at St. Andrews, was to be the professor of physic.
Boswell's _Hebrides_, Aug. 25, 1773.

[1399] Mr. Andrew Chamier was of Huguenot descent, and had been a
stock-broker. He was a man of liberal education. 'He acquired such a
fortune as enabled him, though young, to quit business, and become, what
indeed he seemed by nature intended for, a gentleman.' Hawkins's
_Johnson_, p. 422. In 1764 he was Secretary in the War Office. In 1775
he was appointed Under Secretary of State. Forster's _Goldsmith_, i.
310. He was to be the professor of commercial politics in the imaginary
college. Johnson passed one of his birth-days at his house; _post_,
under Sept. 9, 1779, note.

[1400] 'It was Johnson's intention,' writes Hawkins (_Life_, p. 423),
'that their number should not exceed nine.' Nine was the number of the
Ivy Lane Club (_ante_, p. 190). Johnson, I suppose, looked upon nine as
the most _clubable_ number. 'It was intended,' says Dr. Percy, 'that if
only two of these chanced to meet for the evening, they should be able
to entertain each other.' Goldsmith's _Misc. Works_, i. 70. Hawkins adds
that 'Mr. Dyer (_post_, 1780 in Mr. Langton's _Collection_), a member of
the Ivy Lane Club, who for some years had been abroad, made his
appearance among us, and was cordially received.' According to Dr.
Percy, by 1768 not only had Hawkins formally withdrawn, but Beauclerk
had forsaken the club for more fashionable ones. 'Upon this the Club
agreed to increase their number to twelve; every new member was to be
elected by ballot, and one black ball was sufficient for exclusion. Mr.
Beauclerk then desired to be restored to the Society, and the following
new members were introduced on Monday, Feb. 15, 1768; Sir R. Chambers,
Dr. Percy and Mr. Colman.' Goldsmith's _Misc. Works_, i. 72. In the list
in Croker's _Boswell_, ed. 1844, ii. 326, the election of Percy and
Chambers is placed in 1765.

[1401] Boswell wrote on April 4, 1775:--'I dine, Friday, at the Turk's
Head, Gerrard-street, with our Club, Sir Joshua Reynolds, etc., who now
dine once a month, and sup every Friday.' _Letters of Boswell_, p. 186.
In 1766, Monday was the night of meeting. _Post_, May 10, 1766. In Dec.
1772 the night was changed to Friday. Goldsmith's _Misc. Works_, i. 72.
Hawkins says (_Life_, pp. 424, 5):--'We seldom got together till nine;
preparing supper took up till ten; and by the time that the table was
cleared, it was near eleven. Our evening toast was the motto of Padre
Paolo, _Esto perpetua! Esto perpetua_ was being soon not Padre Paolo's
motto, but his dying prayer. 'As his end evidently approached, the
brethren of the convent came to pronounce the last prayers, with which
he could only join in his thoughts, being able to pronounce no more than
these words, "_Esto perpetua_" mayst thou last for ever; which was
understood to be a prayer for the prosperity of his country.' Johnson's
_Works_, vi. 269.

[1402] See _post_, March 14, 1777.

[1403] 'After 1783 it removed to Prince's in Sackville-street, and on
his house being soon afterwards shut up, it removed to Baxter's, which
subsequently became Thomas's, in Dover-street. In January 1792 it
removed to Parsloe's, in St. James's-street; and on February 26, 1799,
to the Thatched-house in the same street.' Forster's _Goldsmith_ i. 311.

[1406] From Sir Joshua Reynolds. BOSWELL. The Knight having refused to
pay his portion of the reckoning for supper, because he usually eat no
supper at home, Johnson observed, 'Sir John, Sir, is a very _unclubable_
man.' BURNEY. Hawkins (_Life_, p. 231) says that 'Mr. Dyer had
contracted a fatal intimacy with some persons of desperate fortunes, who
were dealers in India stock, at a time when the affairs of the company
were in a state of fluctuation.' Malone, commenting on this passage,
says that 'under these words Mr. Burke is darkly alluded to, together
with his cousin.' He adds that the character given of Dyer by Hawkins
'is discoloured by the malignant prejudices of that shallow writer, who,
having quarrelled with Mr. Burke, carried his enmity even to Mr. Burke's
friends.' Prior's _Malone_, p. 419. See also _ante_, p. 27. Hawkins
(_Life_, p. 420) said of Goldsmith:--'As he wrote for the booksellers,
we at the Club looked on him as a mere literary drudge, equal to the
task of compiling and translating, but little capable of original, and
still less of poetical composition.'

[1407] _Life of Johnson_, p. 425. BOSWELL. Hawkins is 'equally
inaccurate' in saying' that Johnson was so constant at our meetings as
never to absent himself.' (_Ib_. p. 424.) See _post_, Johnson's letter
to Langton of March 9, 1766, where he says:--'Dyer is constant at the
Club; Hawkins is remiss; I am not over diligent.'

[1408] Letters to and from Dr. Johnson. Vol. ii. p. 278 [387]. BOSWELL.
The passage is as follows:--'"If he _does_ apply," says our Doctor to
Mr. Thrale, "I'll black-ball him." "Who, Sir? Mr. Garrick, your friend,
your companion,--black-ball him!" "Why, Sir, I love my little David
dearly, better than all or any of his flatterers do, but surely one
ought, &c."'

[1409] Pope's _Moral Essays_, iii. 242.

[1410] Malone says that it was from him that Boswell had his account of
Garrick's election, and that he had it from Reynolds. He adds that
'Johnson warmly supported Garrick, being in reality a very tender
affectionate man. He was merely offended at the actors conceit.' He
continues:--'On the former part of this story it probably was that
Hawkins grounded his account that Garrick never was of the Club, and
that Johnson said he never ought to be of it. And thus it is that this
stupid biographer, and the more flippant and malicious Mrs. Piozzi have
miscoloured and misrepresented almost every anecdote that they have
pretented to tell of Dr. Johnson.' Prior's _Malone_, p. 392. Whatever
was the slight cast upon Garrick, he was nevertheless the sixth new
member elected. Four, as I have shown, were added by 1768. The next
elections were in 1773 (Croker's _Boswell_, ed. 1844. ii. 326), when
five were added, of whom Garrick was the second, and Boswell the fifth.
In 1774 five more were elected, among whom were Fox and Gibbon. Hannah
More (_Memoirs_, i. 249) says that 'upon Garrick's death, when
numberless applications were made to succeed him [in the Club], Johnson
was deaf to them all. He said, "No, there never could be found any
successor worthy of such a man;" and he insisted upon it there should be
a year's widowhood in the club, before they thought of a new election.'

[1411] Grainger wrote to Percy on April 6, 1764:--'Sam. Johnson says he
will review it in _The Critical_' In August, 1765, he wrote:--'I am
perfectly satisfied with the reception the _Sugar Cane_ has met with,
and am greatly obliged to you and Mr. Johnson for the generous care you
took of it in my absence.' Prior's _Goldsmith_, i. 238. He was absent in
the West Indies. He died on Dec. 16, 1766. _Ib_. p. 241. The review of
the _Sugar Cane_ in the _Critical Review_ (p. 270) is certainly by
Johnson. The following passage is curious:--'The last book begins with a
striking invocation to the genius of Africa, and goes on to give proper
instructions for the buying and choice of negroes.... The poet talks of
this ungenerous commerce without the least appearance of detestation;
but proceeds to direct these purchasers of their fellow-creatures with
the same indifference that a groom would give instructions for
choosing a horse.

'Clear roll their ample eye; their tongue be red;
 Broad swell their chest; their shoulders wide expand;
 Not prominent their belly; clean and strong
 Their thighs and legs in just proportion risc.'

See also _post_, March 21, 1776.

[1412] Johnson thus ends his brief review:--'Such in the poem on which
we now congratulate the public as on a production to which, since the
death of Pope, it not be easy to find anything equal.' _Critical
Review_, p. 462.

[1413] _Pr. and Med_. p. 50. BOSWELL. He adds:--

'I hope
 To put my rooms in order.
 Disorder I have found one great cause of idleness.'

[1414] _Ib_. p. 51. BOSWELL.

[1415] It was on his birth-day that he said this. He wrote on the same
day:--'I have outlived many friends. I have felt many sorrows. I have
made few improvements.'

[1416] _Prayers and Meditations_, p. 58. BOSWELL. In his _Vision of
Theodore_ (_Works_, ix. 174) he describes the state of mind which he has
recorded in his Meditations:--'There were others whose crime it was
rather to neglect Reason than to disobey her; and who retreated from the
heat and tumult of the way, not to the bowers of Intemperance, but to
the maze of Indolence. They had this peculiarity in their condition,
that they were always in sight of the road of Reason, always wishing for
her presence, and always resolving to return to-morrow.'

[1417] See Appendix F.

[1418] It used to be imagined at Mr. Thrale's, when Johnson retired to a
window or corner of the room, by perceiving his lips in motion, and
hearing a murmur without audible articulation, that he was praying: but
this was not _always_ the case, for I was once, perhaps unperceived by
him, writing at a table, so near the place of his retreat, that I heard
him repeating some lines in an ode of Horace, over and over again, as if
by iteration, to exercise the organs of speech, and fix the ode in
his memory:

     Audiet cives acuisse ferrum
     Quo graves Persas melius perirent,
     Audiet pugnas....
                     Odes, i. 2, 21.
     ['Our sons shall hear, shall hear to latest times,
       Of Roman arms with civil gore imbrued,
       Which better had the Persian foe subdued.'
                           _Francis_.]

It was during the American War. BURNEY. Boswell in his _Hebrides_ (Oct.
12, 1773) records, 'Dr. Johnson is often uttering pious ejaculations,
when he appears to be talking to himself; for sometimes his voice grows
stronger, and parts of the Lord's Prayer are heard.' In the same passage
he describes other 'particularities,' and adds in a note:--'It is
remarkable that Dr. Johnson should have read this account of some of his
own peculiar habits, without saying anything on the subject, which I
hoped he would have done.' See _post_, Dec. 1784, note.

[1419] Churchill's _Poems_, i. 16. See _ante_, p. 391.

[1420] 'It is in vain to try to find a meaning in every one of his
particularities, which, I suppose, are mere habits contracted by chance;
of which every man has some that are more or less remarkable.' Boswell's
_Hebrides_, Oct. 12, 1773. 'The love of symmetry and order, which is
natural to the mind of man, betrays him sometimes into very whimsical
fancies. "This noble principle," says a French author, "loves to amuse
itself on the most trifling occasions. You may see a profound
philosopher," says he, "walk for an hour together in his chamber, and
industriously treading at every step upon every other board in the
flooring."' _The Spectator_, No. 632.

[1421] Mr. S. Whyte (_Miscellanea Nova_, p. 49) tells how from old Mr.
Sheridan's house in Bedford-street, opposite Henrietta-street, with an
opera-glass he watched Johnson approaching. 'I perceived him at a good
distance working along with a peculiar solemnity of deportment, and an
awkward sort of measured step. Upon every post as he passed along, he
deliberately laid his hand; but missing one of them, when he had got at
some distance he seemed suddenly to recollect himself, and immediately
returning carefully performed the accustomed ceremony, and resumed his
former course, not omitting one till he gained the crossing. This, Mr.
Sheridan assured me, was his constant practice.'

[1422] _Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides_, 3rd edit. p. 316. BOSWELL.
'The day that we left Talisker, he bade us ride on. He then turned the
head of his horse back towards Talisker, stopped for some time; then
wheeled round to the same direction with ours, and then came briskly
after us.' Boswell's _Hebrides_', Oct. 12, 1773.

[1423] Sir Joshua's sister, for whom Johnson had a particular affection,
and to whom he wrote many letters which I have seen, and which I am
sorry her too nice delicacy will not permit to be published. BOSWELL.
'Whilst the company at Mr. Thrale's were speculating upon a microscope
for the mind, Johnson exclaimed:--"I never saw one that would bear it,
except that of my dear Miss Reynolds, and hers is very near to purity
itself."' Northcote's _Reynolds_, i. 80. Once, said Northcote, there was
a coolness between her and her brother. She wished to set forth to him
her grievances in a letter. Not finding it easy to write, she consulted
Johnson, 'who offered to write a letter himself, which when copied
should pass as her own.' This he did. It began: 'I am well aware that
complaints are always odious, but complain I must.' Such a letter as
this she saw would not pass with Sir Joshua as her own, and so she could
not use it. _Ib_. p. 203. Of Johnson's letters to her Malone published
one, and Mr. Croker several more. Mme. D'Arblay, in the character she
draws of her (_Memoirs of Dr. Burney_, i. 332), says that 'Dr. Johnson
tried in vain to cure her of living in an habitual perplexity of mind
and irresolution of conduct, which to herself was restlessly tormenting,
and to all around her was teazingly wearisome.'

[1428] Mr. Croker, misunderstanding a passage in Hawkins,
writes:--'Hawkins says that he disliked to be called Doctor, as
reminding him that he had been a schoolmaster.' What Hawkins really says
(_Life_, p. 446) is this:--'His attachment to Oxford prevented Johnson
from receiving this honour as it was intended, and he never assumed the
title which it conferred. He was as little pleased to be called Doctor
in consequence of it, as he was with the title of _Domine_, which a
friend of his once incautiously addressed him by. He thought it alluded
to his having been a schoolmaster.' It is clear that 'it' in the last
line refers only to the title of _Domine_. Murphy (_Life_, p. 98) says
that Johnson never assumed the title of Doctor, till Oxford conferred on
him the degree. Boswell states (_post_, March 31, 1775, note):--'It is
remarkable that he never, so far as I know, assumed his title of
_Doctor_, but called himself _Mr_. Johnson.' In this, as I show there,
Boswell seems to be not perfectly accurate. I do not believe Hawkins's
assertion that Johnson 'was little pleased to be called Doctor in
consequence of his Dublin degree.' In Boswell's Hebrides, most of which
was read by him before he received his Oxford degree, he is commonly
styled Doctor. Boswell says in a note on Aug. 15, 1773:--'It was some
time before I could bring myself to call him Doctor.' Had Johnson
disliked the title it would have been known to Boswell. Mrs. Thrale, it
is true, in her letters' to him, after he had received both his degrees,
commonly speaks of him as Mr. Johnson. We may assume that he valued his
Oxford degree of M.A. more highly than the Dublin degree of LL.D.; for
in the third edition of the _Abridgment of his Dictionary_, published in
1766, he is styled Samuel Johnson, A.M. In his _Lives of the Poets_ he
calls himself simply Samuel Johnson. He had by that time risen above
degrees. In his _Journey to the Hebrides_ (_Works_, ix. 14), after
stating that 'An English or Irish doctorate cannot be obtained by a very
young man,' he continues:--'It is reasonable to suppose ... that he who
is by age qualified to be a doctor, has in so much time gained learning
sufficient not to disgrace the title, or wit sufficient not to
desire it.'

[1429] Trinity College made him, it should seem, _Armiger_ at the same
time that it made him Doctor of Laws.

[1436] Mr. Blakeway, in a note on this passage, says:--'The predecessor
of old Thrale was Edmund Halsey, Esq.; the nobleman who married his
daughter was Lord Cobham. The family of Thrale was of some consideration
in St. Albans; in the Abbey-church is a handsome monument to the memory
of Mr. John Thrale, late of London, merchant, who died in 1704.' He
describes the arms on the monument. Mr. Hayward, in _Mrs. Piozzis
Autobiography_, i. 9, quotes her marginal note on this page in Boswell.
She says that Edmund Halsey, son of a miller at St. Albans, married the
only daughter of his master, old Child, of the Anchor Brewhouse,
Southwark, and succeeded to the business upon Child's death. 'He sent
for one of his sister's sons to London (my Mr. Thrale's father); said he
would make a man of him, and did so; but made him work very hard, and
treated him very roughly.' He left him nothing at his death, and Thrale
bought the brewery of Lord and Lady Cobham.

[1437] See _post_, under April 4, 1781, and June 16, 1781.

[1438] Mrs. Burney informs me that she heard Dr. Johnson say, 'An
English Merchant is a new species of Gentleman.' He, perhaps, had in his
mind the following ingenious passage in _The Conscious Lovers_, act iv.
scene ii, where Mr. Sealand thus addresses Sir John Bevil: 'Give me
leave to say, that we merchants are a species of gentry that have grown
into the world this last century, and are as honourable, and almost as
useful as you landed-folks, that have always thought yourselves so much
above us; for your trading forsooth is extended no farther than a load
of hay, or a fat ox.--You are pleasant people indeed! because you are
generally bred up to be lazy, therefore, I warrant your industry is
dishonourable.' BOSWELL.

_The Conscious Lovers_ is by Steele. 'I never heard of any plays fit for
a Christian to read,' said Parson Adams, 'but _Cato_ and _The Conscious
Lovers_; and I must own, in the latter there are some things almost
solemn enough for a sermon.' _Joseph Andrews_, Book III, chap. xi.

[1439] In the first number of _The Hypochondriack_ Boswell writes:--'It
is a saying in feudal treatises, "Semel Baro semper Baro_," "Once a
baron always a baron."' _London Mag_. 1777, p. 493. He seems of Mr.
Thrale's inferiority by speaking of him as Thrale and his house as
Thrale's. See _post_, April 5 and 12, 1776, April 7, 1778, and under
March 30, 1783. He never, I believe, is thus familiar in the case of
Beauclerk, Burke, Langton, and Reynolds.

[1440] For her extraction see Hayward's _Mrs. Piozzi_, i. 238.

[1441] Miss Burney records in May 1779, how one day at Streatham 'Mr.
Murphy met with a very joyful reception; and Mr. Thrale, for the first
time in his life, said he was "a good fellow;" for he makes it a sort of
rule to salute him with the title of "scoundrel," or "rascal." They are
very old friends; and I question if Mr. Thrale loves any man so well.'
Mme. D'Arblay's _Diary_, i. 210.

[1442] From the _Garrick Corres_, i. 116, it seems that Murphy
introduced Garrick to the Thrales. He wrote to him on May 13,
1760:--'You stand engaged to Mr. Thrale for Wednesday night. You need
not apprehend drinking; it is a very easy house.'

[1443] Murphy (_Life_, p. 98) says that Johnson's introduction to the
Thrales 'contributed more than anything else to exempt him from the
solicitudes of life.' He continues that 'he looks back to the share he
had in that business with self congratulation, since he knows the
tenderness which from that time soothed Johnson's cares at Streatham,
and prolonged a valuable life.' Johnson wrote to Mrs. Thrale from
Lichfield on July 20, 1767:--'I have found nothing that withdraws my
affections from the friends whom I left behind, or which makes me less
desirous of reposing at that place which your kindness and Mr. Thrale's
allows me to call my _home_.' _Piozzi Letters_, i. 4. From Mull, on Oct.
15, 1773, he wrote:--'Having for many weeks had no letter, my longings
are very great to be informed how all things are at home, as you and
mistress allow me to call it.' _Ib_. p. 166. Miss Burney in 1778 wrote
that 'though Dr. Johnson lives almost wholly at Streatham, he always
keeps his apartments in town.' Mme. D'Arblay's _Diary_, i. 58. Johnson
(_Works_, viii. 381) tells how, in the house of Sir Thomas Abney, 'Dr.
Watts, with a constancy of friendship and uniformity of conduct not
often to be found, was treated for thirty-six years with all the
kindness that friendship could prompt, and all the attention that
respect could dictate.' He continues:--'A coalition like this, a state
in which the notions of patronage and dependence were overpowered by the
perception of reciprocal benefits, deserves a particular memorial.' It
was such a coalition which he formed with the Thrales--a coalition in
which, though the benefits which he received were great, yet those which
he conferred were still greater.

[1444] On this Mrs. Piozzi notes:--'No, no! Mr. Thrale's manners
presented the character of a gay man of the town; like Millamant, in
Congreve's comedy, he abhorred the country and everything in it.'
Hayward's _Piozzi_, i. 10. Mrs. Millamant, in _The Way of the World_,
act iv. sc. iv., says:--'I loathe the country and everything that
relates to it.'

[1445] 'It is but justice to Mr. Thrale to say, that a more ingenuous
frame of mind no man possessed. His education at Oxford gave him the
habits of a gentleman; his amiable temper recommended his conversation,
and the goodness of his heart made him a sincere friend.' Murphy's
_Johnson_, p. 99. Johnson wrote of him to Mrs. Thrale:--'He must keep
well, for he is the pillar of the house; and you must get well, or the
house will hardly be worth propping.' _Piozzi Letters_, i. 340. See
_post_, April 18, 1778. Mme. D'Arblay (_Memoirs of Dr. Burney_, ii. 104)
gives one reason for Thrale's fondness for Johnson's society. 'Though
entirely a man of peace, and a gentleman in his character, he had a
singular amusement in hearing, instigating, and provoking a war of
words, alternating triumph and overthrow, between clever and ambitious
colloquial combatants, where there was nothing that could inflict
disgrace upon defeat.'

[1446] In like manner he called Mr. Thrale _Master_ or _My master_. 'I
hope Master's walk will be finished when I come back.' _Piozzi Letters_,
i. 355. 'My master may plant and dig till his pond is an ocean.' _Ib_.
p. 357. See _post_, July 9, 1777.

[1447] Miss Burney thus described her in 1776:--'She is extremely lively
and chatty; and showed none of the supercilious or pedantic airs so
scoffingly attributed to women of learning or celebrity; on the
contrary, she is full of sport, remarkably gay, and excessively
agreeable. I liked her in everything except her entrance into the room,
which was rather florid and flourishing, as who should say, "It is
I!--No less a person than Mrs. Thrale!" However, all that ostentation
wore out in the course of the visit, which lasted the whole morning; and
you could not have helped liking her, she is so very entertaining--
though not simple enough, I believe, for quite winning your heart.'
_Memoirs of Dr. Burney_, ii. 88.

[1448] _Mrs. Piozzi's Anecdotes_, p. 279. BOSWELL.

[1449] Johnson wrote to Mrs. Thrale on Oct. 13, 1777:--'I cannot but
think on your kindness and my master's. Life has upon the whole fallen
short, very short, of my early expectation; but the acquisition of such
a friendship, at an age when new friendships are seldom acquired, is
something better than the general course of things gives man a right to
expect. I think on it with great delight; I am not very apt to be
delighted.' _Piozzi Letters_, ii. 7. Johnson's friends suffered from
this connection. See _post_, March 20, 1778, where it is said that 'at
Streatham he was in a great measure absorbed from the society of his
old friends.'

[1450] Yet one year he recorded:--'March 3, I have never, I thank God,
since new year's day deviated from the practice of rising. In this
practice I persisted till I went to Mr. Thrale's sometime before
Midsummer; the irregularity of that family broke my habit of rising. I
was there till after Michaelmas.' Hawkins's _Johnson_, p. 458, note.
Hawkins places this in 1765; but Johnson states (_Pr. and Med_. p. 71),
'I returned from Streatham, Oct. 1, --66, having lived there more than
three months.'

[1451] Boswell wrote to Temple in 1775:--'I am at present in a
_tourbillon_ of conversations; but how come you to throw in the Thrales
among the Reynoldses and the Beauclerks? Mr. Thrale is a worthy,
sensible man, and has the wits much about his house; but he is not one
himself. Perhaps you mean Mrs. Thrale.' _Letters of Boswell_, p. 192.
Murphy (_Life_, p. 141) says:--'It was late in life before Johnson had
the habit of mixing, otherwise than occasionally, with polite company.
At Mr. Thrale's he saw a constant succession of well-accomplished
visitors. In that society he began to wear off the rugged points of his
own character. The time was then expected when he was to cease being
what George Garrick, brother to the celebrated actor, called him the
first time he heard him converse. "A TREMENDOUS COMPANION"'

[1452] Johnson wrote to Dr. Warton on Oct. 9:--'Mrs. Warton uses me
hardly in supposing that I could forget so much kindness and civility as
she showed me at Winchester.' Wooll's _Warton_, p. 309. Malone on this
remarks:--'It appears that Johnson spent some time with that gentleman
at Winchester in this year.' I believe that Johnson is speaking of the
year 1762, when, on his way to Devonshire, he passed two nights in that
town. See Taylor's _Reynolds_, i. 214.

[1453] It was in 1745 that he published his _Observations on Macbeth_,
as a specimen of his projected edition (_ante_, p. 175). In 1756 he
issued _Proposals_ undertaking that his work should be published before
Christmas, 1757 (p. 318). On June 21, 1757, he writes:--'I am printing
my new edition of _Shakspeare_' (p. 322). On Dec. 24 of the same year he
says, 'I shall publish about March' (p. 323). On March 8, 1758, he
writes:--'It will be published before summer.... I have printed many of
the plays' (p. 327). In June of the same year Langton took some of the
plays to Oxford (p. 336). Churchill's _Ghost_ (Parts 1 and 2) was
published in the spring of 1762 (p. 319). On July 20, 1762, Johnson
wrote to Baretti, 'I intend that you shall soon receive Shakspeare' (p.
369). In October 1765 it was published.

[1454] According to Mr. Seward (_Anec_. ii. 464), 'Adam Smith styled it
the most manly piece of criticism that was ever published in
any country.'

[1455] George III, at all events, did not share in this blind
admiration. 'Was there ever,' cried he, 'such stuff as great part of
Shakespeare? only one must not say so. But what think you? What? Is
there not sad stuff? What? What?' 'Yes, indeed, I think so, Sir, though
mixed with such excellencies that--' 'O!' cried he, laughing
good-humouredly, 'I know it is not to be said! but it's true. Only it's
Shakespeare, and nobody dare abuse him.' Mme. D'Arblay's _Diary_,
ii, 398.

[1456] That Johnson did not slur his work, as has been often said, we
have the best of all evidence--his own word. 'I have, indeed,' he writes
(_Works_, v. 152), 'disappointed no opinion more than my own; yet I have
endeavoured to perform my task with no slight solicitude. Not a single
passage in the whole work has appeared to me corrupt which I have not
attempted to restore; or obscure which I have not attempted to
illustrate.'

[1457] Steevens wrote to Garrick:--'To say the truth, the errors of
Warburton and Johnson are often more meritorious than such corrections
of them as the obscure industry of Mr. Farmer and myself can furnish.
Disdaining crutches, they have sometimes had a fall; but it is my duty
to remember, that I, for my part, could not have kept on my legs at all
without them.' _Garrick Corres_. ii, 130. 'Johnson's preface and notes
are distinguished by clearness of thought and diction, and by masterly
common sense.' _Cambridge Shakespeare_, i. xxxvi.

[1458] Kenrick later on was the gross libeller of Goldsmith, and the far
grosser libeller of Garrick. 'When proceedings were commenced against
him in the Court of King's Bench [for the libel on Garrick], he made at

i. 294. In the _Garrick Carres_, (ii. 341) is a letter addressed to
Kenrick, in which Garrick says:--'I could have honoured you by giving
the satisfaction of a gentleman, _if you could_ (as Shakespeare says)
_have screwed your courage to the sticking place_, to have taken it.' It
is endorsed:--'This was not sent to the scoundrel Dr. Kenrick.... It was
judged best not to answer any more of Dr. Kenrick's notes, he had
behaved so unworthily.'

[1459] Ephraim Chambers, in the epitaph that he made for himself
(_ante_, p. 219), had described himself as _multis pervulgatus paucis
notus_.' _Gent. Mag_. x. 262.

[1461] Johnson had joined Voltaire with Dennis and Rymer. 'Dennis and
Rymer think Shakespeare's Romans not sufficiently Roman; and Voltaire
censures his kings as not completely royal. Dennis is offended that
Menenius, a senator of Rome, should play the buffoon; and Voltaire,
perhaps, thinks decency violated when the Danish usurper is represented
as a drunkard. But Shakespeare always makes nature predominate over
accident.... His story requires Romans or kings, but he
