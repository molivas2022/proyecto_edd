   [acronym: Press Lots Of Keys To Abort] To press random keys in an
   attempt to get some response from the system. One might plokta when
   the abort procedure for a program is not known, or when trying to
   figure out if the system is just sluggish or really hung. Plokta can
   also be used while trying to figure out any unknown key sequence for a
   particular operation. Someone going into `plokta mode' usually places
   both hands flat on the keyboard and mashes them down, hoping for some
   useful response.

   or at least prototyped by a suitable collection of pipelines and
   temp-file grinding encapsulated in a shell script; this is much less
   effort than writing C every time, and the capability is considered one
   of Unix's major winning features. A few other OSs such as IBM's VM/CMS
   support similar facilities. Esp. used in the construction `hairy

   A Page Description Language ([10530]PDL), based on work originally

   finally implemented in its current form by John Warnock et al. after
   he and Chuck Geschke founded Adobe Systems Incorporated in 1982.
   PostScript gets its leverage by using a full programming language,
   rather than a series of low-level escape sequences, to describe an
   image to be printed on a laser printer or other output device (in this
   it parallels [10532]EMACS, which exploited a similar insight about
   editing tasks). It is also noteworthy for implementing on-the fly
   rasterization, from Bezier curve descriptions, of high-quality fonts
   at low (e.g. 300 dpi) resolution (it was formerly believed that
   hand-tuned bitmap fonts were required for this task). Hackers consider
   PostScript to be among the most elegant hacks of all time, and the
   combination of technical merits and widespread availability has made
   PostScript the language of choice for graphical output.

   2. [techspeak] A report on the amounts of time spent in each routine
   of a program, used to find and [10624]tune away the [10625]hot spots
   in it. This sense is often verbed. Some profiling modes report units
   other than time (such as call counts) and/or report at granularities
   other than per-routine, but the idea is similar. 3.[techspeak] A
   subset of a standard used for a particular purpose. This sense
   confuses hackers who wander into the weird world of ISO standards no

   1. In [10664]marketroid-speak, superior; implies a product imbued with

   hardware or software designers. 2. In the language of hackers and
   users, inferior; implies a product not conforming to open-systems

   vendor able to gouge freely on service and upgrade charges after the
   initial sale has locked the customer in. Often in the phrase
   "proprietary crap". 3. Synonym for closed-source, e.g. software issued
   in binary without source and under a restructive license.
   
   Since the coining of the term [10665]open source, many hackers have
   made a conscious effort to distinguish between `proprietary' and
   `commercial' software. It is possible for software to be commercial
   (that is, intended to make a profit for the producers) without being
   proprietary. The reverse is also possible, for example in binary-only
   freeware.

   [techspeak] (alt. `punch card') The signature medium of computing's
   [10733]Stone Age, now obsolescent outside of some IBM shops. The
   punched card actually predated computers considerably, originating in
   1801 as a control device for mechanical looms. The version patented by
   Hollerith and used with mechanical tabulating machines in the 1890
   U.S. Census was a piece of cardboard about 90 mm by 215 mm. There is a
   widespread myth that it was designed to fit in the currency trays used
   for that era's larger dollar bills, but recent investigations have
   falsified this.
   
   IBM (which originated as a tabulating-machine manufacturer) married
   the punched card to computers, encoding binary information as patterns
   of small rectangular holes; one character per column, 80 columns per
   card. Other coding schemes, sizes of card, and hole shapes were tried
   at various times.
   
   The 80-column width of most character terminals is a legacy of the IBM
   punched card; so is the size of the quick-reference cards distributed
   with many varieties of computers even today. See [10734]chad,
   [10735]chad box, [10736]eighty-column mind, [10737]green card,

   an inefficient hack. 3. A design decision to defer solving a problem,
   typically because one cannot define what is desirable sufficiently
   well to frame an algorithmic solution. "No way to know what the right
   form to dump the graph in is -- we'll punt that for now." 4. To hand a
   tricky implementation problem off to some other section of the design.
   "It's too hard to get the compiler to do that; let's punt to the

   In techspeak and jargon, the standard metric prefixes used in the SI
   (Système International) conventions for scientific measurement have
   dual uses. With units of time or things that come in powers of 10,
   such as money, they retain their usual meanings of multiplication by
   powers of 1000 = 10^3. But when used with bytes or other things that
   naturally come in powers of 2, they usually denote multiplication by
   powers of 1024 = 2^(10).
   
   Here are the SI magnifying prefixes, along with the corresponding
   binary interpretations in common use:
prefix  decimal  binary
kilo-   1000^1   1024^1 = 2^10 = 1,024

   Here are the SI fractional prefixes:
prefix  decimal     jargon usage
milli-  1000^-1     (seldom used in jargon)
micro-  1000^-2     small or human-scale (see [10806]micro-)
nano-   1000^-3     even smaller (see [10807]nano-)

zepto-  1000^-7     (not used in jargon---yet)
yocto-  1000^-8     (not used in jargon---yet)

   The prefixes zetta-, yotta-, zepto-, and yocto- have been included in
   these tables purely for completeness and giggle value; they were
   adopted in 1990 by the `19th Conference Generale des Poids et
   Mesures'. The binary peta- and exa- loadings, though well established,
   are not in jargon use either -- yet. The prefix milli-, denoting
   multiplication by 1/1000, has always been rare in jargon (there is,
   however, a standard joke about the `millihelen' -- notionally, the
   amount of beauty required to launch one ship). See the entries on
   [10809]micro-, [10810]pico-, and [10811]nano- for more information on
   connotative jargon use of these terms. `Femto' and `atto' (which,
   interestingly, derive not from Greek but from Danish) have not yet
   acquired jargon loadings, though it is easy to predict what those will
   be once computing technology enters the required realms of magnitude
   (however, see [10812]attoparsec).
   
   There are, of course, some standard unit prefixes for powers of 10. In
   the following table, the `prefix' column is the international standard
   suffix for the appropriate power of ten; the `binary' column lists
   jargon abbreviations and words for the corresponding power of 2. The
   B-suffixed forms are commonly used for byte quantities; the words
   `meg' and `gig' are nouns that may (but do not always) pluralize with
   `s'.
prefix   decimal   binary       pronunciation
kilo-       k      K, KB,       /kay/
mega-       M      M, MB, meg   /meg/
giga-       G      G, GB, gig   /gig/,/jig/

   Confusingly, hackers often use K or M as though they were suffix or
   numeric multipliers rather than a prefix; thus "2K dollars", "2M of
   disk space". This is also true (though less commonly) of G.
   
   Note that the formal SI metric prefix for 1000 is `k'; some use this
   strictly, reserving `K' for multiplication by 1024 (KB is thus
   `kilobytes').
   
   K, M, and G used alone refer to quantities of bytes; thus, 64G is 64
   gigabytes and `a K' is a kilobyte (compare mainstream use of `a G' as
   short for `a grand', that is, $1000). Whether one pronounces `gig'
   with hard or soft `g' depends on what one thinks the proper
   pronunciation of `giga-' is.
   
   Confusing 1000 and 1024 (or other powers of 2 and 10 close in
   magnitude) -- for example, describing a memory in units of 500K or
   524K instead of 512K -- is a sure sign of the [10813]marketroid. One
   example of this: it is common to refer to the capacity of 3.5"
   [10814]microfloppies as `1.44 MB' In fact, this is a completely
   [10815]bogus number. The correct size is 1440 KB, that is, 1440 * 1024
   = 1474560 bytes. So the `mega' in `1.44 MB' is compounded of two
   `kilos', one of which is 1024 and the other of which is 1000. The
   correct number of megabytes would of course be 1440 / 1024 = 1.40625.
   Alas, this fine point is probably lost on the world forever.
   
   [1993 update: hacker Morgan Burke has proposed, to general approval on
   Usenet, the following additional prefixes:
   
   groucho
          10^(-30)
          
   harpo
          10^(-27)
          
   harpi
          10^(27)
          
   grouchi
          10^(30)
          
   We observe that this would leave the prefixes zeppo-, gummo-, and
   chico- available for future expansion. Sadly, there is little
   immediate prospect that Mr. Burke's eminently sensible proposal will
   be ratified.]

   [from the name of the logician Willard van Orman Quine, via Douglas
   Hofstadter] A program that generates a copy of its own source text as
   its complete output. Devising the shortest possible quine in some
   given programming language is a common hackish amusement. (We ignore
   some variants of BASIC in which a program consisting of a single empty
   string literal reproduces itself trivially.) Here is one classic
   quine:
((lambda (x)
  (list x (list (quote quote) x)))
 (quote
    (lambda (x)
      (list x (list (quote quote) x)))))

   This one works in LISP or Scheme. It's relatively easy to write quines
   in other languages such as Postscript which readily handle programs as
   data; much harder (and thus more challenging!) in languages like C
   which do not. Here is a classic C quine for ASCII machines:
char*f="char*f=%c%s%c;main()
{printf(f,34,f,34,10);}%c";
main(){printf(f,34,f,34,10);}

   For excruciatingly exact quinishness, remove the interior line breaks.
   Here is another elegant quine in ANSI C:
#define q(k)main(){return!puts(#k"\nq("#k")");}
q(#define q(k)main(){return!puts(#k"\nq("#k")");})

   Some infamous [10844]Obfuscated C Contest entries have been quines
   that reproduced in exotic ways. There is an amusing [10845]Quine Home

   this purpose when he was young and naive and not yet interacting with

   [from the keycaps at the upper left] Pertaining to a standard
   English-language typewriter keyboard (sometimes called the Sholes
   keyboard after its inventor), as opposed to Dvorak or non-US-ASCII
   layouts or a [10883]space-cadet keyboard or APL keyboard.
   
   Historical note: The QWERTY layout is a fine example of a
   [10884]fossil. It is sometimes said that it was designed to slow down
   the typist, but this is wrong; it was designed to allow faster typing
   -- under a constraint now long obsolete. In early typewriters, fast
   typing using nearby type-bars jammed the mechanism. So Sholes fiddled
   the layout to separate the letters of many common digraphs (he did a
   far from perfect job, though; `th', `tr', `ed', and `er', for example,
   each use two nearby keys). Also, putting the letters of `typewriter'
   on one line allowed it to be typed with particular speed and accuracy
   for [10885]demos. The jamming problem was essentially solved soon
   afterward by a suitable use of springs, but the keyboard layout lives
   on.
   
   The QWERTY keyboard has also spawned some unhelpful economic myths
   about how technical standards get and stay established; see
   [10886]http://www.reasonmag.com/9606/Fe.QWERTY.html.

   worth noting that randomness can actually be a valuable resource, very
   useful for applications in cryptography and elsewhere. Computers are
   so thoroughly deterministic that they have a hard time generating
   high-quality randomess, so hackers have sometimes felt the need to
   built special-purpose contraptions for this purpose alone. One
   well-known website offers random bits [11029]generated by radioactive
   decay. Another derives random bits from [11030]images of Lava Lite
   lamps. (Hackers invariably find the latter hilarious. If you have to
   ask why, you'll never get it.)

   coherent, have little or nothing to do with its original objectives.
   There are strong connotations that the coding process and the

   comic strip, the Ratbert is invited to dance on Dilbert's keyboard in
   order to produce bugs for him to fix, and authors a Web browser
   instead.) Compare [11061]Infinite-Monkey Theorem.
   
   This term seems to have become widely recognized quite rapidly after
   the original strip, a fact which testifies to Dilbert's huge
   popularity among hackers. All too many find the perverse incentives
   and Kafkaesque atmosphere of Dilbert's mythical workplace reflective
   of their own experiences.

   `ravioli', and among hackers always means the Chinese kind rather than
   the Italian kind. Both consist of a filling in a pasta shell, but the
   Chinese kind includes no cheese, uses a thinner pasta, has a
   pork-vegetable filling (good ones include Chinese chives), and is
   cooked differently, either by steaming or frying. A rav or dumpling
   can be cooked any way, but a potsticker is always the pan-fried kind

   [indirectly, from the book "Real Men Don't Eat Quiche"] A particular
   sub-variety of hacker: one possessed of a flippant attitude toward
   complexity that is arrogant even when justified by experience. The
   archetypal `Real Programmer' likes to program on the [11137]bare metal
   and is very good at same, remembers the binary opcodes for every
   machine he has ever programmed, thinks that HLLs are sissy, and uses a
   debugger to edit his code because full-screen editors are for wimps.
   Real Programmers aren't satisfied with code that hasn't been
   [11138]bummed into a state of [11139]tenseness just short of rupture.
   Real Programmers never use comments or write documentation: "If it was
   hard to write", says the Real Programmer, "it should be hard to
   understand." Real Programmers can make machines do things that were
   never in their spec sheets; in fact, they are seldom really happy
   unless doing so. A Real Programmer's code can awe with its fiendish
   brilliance, even as its crockishness appalls. Real Programmers live on
   junk food and coffee, hang line-printer art on their walls, and
   terrify the crap out of other programmers -- because someday, somebody
   else might have to try to understand their code in order to change it.
   Their successors generally consider it a [11140]Good Thing that there
   aren't many Real Programmers around any more. For a famous (and
   somewhat more positive) portrait of a Real Programmer, see "[11141]The
   Story of Mel" in Appendix A. The term itself was popularized by a 1983
   Datamation article "Real Programmers Don't Use Pascal" by Ed Post,
   still circulating on Usenet and Internet in on-line form. You can
   browse "Real Programmers Don't Use Pascal" from the Datamation home

   special operating systems (because everything else must take a back

   Used pejoratively by those not in residence there. In conversation,
   talking of someone who has entered the Real World is not unlike
   speaking of a deceased person. It is also noteworthy that on the
   campus of Cambridge University in England, there is a gaily-painted
   lamp-post which bears the label `REALITY CHECKPOINT'. It marks the
   boundary between university and the Real World; check your notions of

   The surprisingly large amount of work that needs to be done as the

   every program of a certain class in the entire known universe. For
   instance, "Add one #define to stdio.h, and you have to recompile the

   file theoretically mandates recompiling every C program in existence,
   even if only to verify that the change didn't screw something else up.
   In practice, you may not actually have to recompile the world, but the

   sufficient to note that regexps also allow complemented character sets
   using ^; thus, one can specify `any non-alphabetic character' with
   [^A-Za-z]. 2. Name of a well-known PD regexp-handling package in

   Many older processor architectures suffer from a serious shortage of
   general-purpose registers. This is especially a problem for
   compiler-writers, because their generated code needs places to store
   temporaries for things like intermediate values in expression
   evaluation. Some designs with this problem, like the Intel 80x86, do
   have a handful of special-purpose registers that can be pressed into
   service, providing suitable care is taken to avoid unpleasant side
   effects on the state of the processor: while the special-purpose
   register is being used to hold an intermediate value, a delicate
   minuet is required in which the previous value of the register is
   saved and then restored just before the official function (and value)
   of the special-purpose register is again needed.

   named CHI. The religion had no doctrines and but one ritual: whenever
   the worshipper noted that a digital clock read 11:08, he or she would
   recite the phrase "It is 11:08; ABS, ALPHABETIC, ARCSIN, ARCCOS,
   ARCTAN." The last five words were the first five functions in the
   appropriate chapter of the Algol manual; note the special

   RFC /R-F-C/ n.
   
   [Request For Comment] One of a long-established series of numbered
   Internet informational documents and standards widely followed by
   commercial software and freeware in the Internet and Unix communities.
   Perhaps the single most influential one has been RFC-822 (the Internet
   mail-format standard). The RFCs are unusual in that they are floated
   by technical experts acting on their own initiative and reviewed by
   the Internet at large, rather than formally promulgated through an
   institution such as ANSI. For this reason, they remain known as RFCs
   even once adopted as standards.
   
   The RFC tradition of pragmatic, experience-driven, after-the-fact
   standard writing done by individuals or small working groups has
   important advantages over the more formal, committee-driven process
   typical of ANSI or ISO. Emblematic of some of these advantages is the
   existence of a flourishing tradition of `joke' RFCs; usually at least
   one a year is published, usually on April 1st. Well-known joke RFCs
   have included 527 ("ARPAWOCKY", R. Merryman, UCSD; 22 June 1973), 748
   ("Telnet Randomly-Lose Option", Mark R. Crispin; 1 April 1978), and
   1149 ("A Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams on Avian
   Carriers", D. Waitzman, BBN STC; 1 April 1990). The first was a Lewis
   Carroll pastiche; the second a parody of the TCP-IP documentation
   style, and the third a deadpan skewering of standards-document
   legalese, describing protocols for transmitting Internet data packets
   by carrier pigeon.
   
   The RFCs are most remarkable for how well they work -- they manage to
   have neither the ambiguities that are usually rife in informal
   specifications, nor the committee-perpetrated misfeatures that often
   haunt formal standards, and they define a network that has grown to
   truly worldwide proportions.

   [Unix] Abbreviation for `Read The Fucking Manual'. 1. Used by
   [11420]gurus to brush off questions they consider trivial or annoying.
   Compare [11421]Don't do that then!. 2. Used when reporting a problem
   to indicate that you aren't just asking out of [11422]randomness. "No,
   I can't figure out how to interface Unix to my toaster, and yes, I
   have RTFM." Unlike sense 1, this use is considered polite. See also

   RTFS /R-T-F-S/
   
   [Unix] 1. imp. Abbreviation for `Read The Fucking Source'. Variant
   form of [11433]RTFM, used when the problem at hand is not necessarily
   obvious and not answerable from the manuals -- or the manuals are not
   yet written and maybe never will be. For even trickier situations, see
   [11434]RTFB. Unlike RTFM, the anger inherent in RTFS is not usually
   directed at the person asking the question, but rather at the people
   who failed to provide adequate documentation. 2. imp. `Read The
   Fucking Standard'; this oath can only be used when the problem area
   (e.g., a language or operating system interface) has actually been
   codified in a ratified standards document. The existence of these
   standards documents (and the technically inappropriate but politically
   mandated compromises that they inevitably contain, and the
   impenetrable [11435]legalese in which they are invariably written, and
   the unbelievably tedious bureaucratic process by which they are
   produced) can be unnerving to hackers, who are used to a certain
   amount of ambiguity in the specifications of the systems they use.
   (Hackers feel that such ambiguities are acceptable as long as the
   [11436]Right Thing to do is obvious to any thinking observer; sadly,
   this casual attitude towards specifications becomes unworkable when a
   system becomes popular in the [11437]Real World.) Since a hacker is
   likely to feel that a standards document is both unnecessary and
   technically deficient, the deprecation inherent in this term may be
   directed as much against the standard as against the person who ought
   to read it.

   Internet worm of 1988 (see [11447]Great Worm); villain to many, naive
   hacker gone wrong to a few. Morris claimed that the worm that brought
   the Internet to its knees was a benign experiment that got out of
   control as the result of a coding error. After the storm of negative
   publicity that followed this blunder, Morris's username on ITS was
   hacked from RTM to [11448]RTFM.

   to. Particularly appropriate when the suit failed to notice the `Press

   that is very difficult to use because of gratuitously poor (random?)
   design decisions. Oppose [11456]cuspy. 3. Anything that manipulates a
   shared resource without regard for its other users in such a way as to

   saga n.
   
   [WPI] A cuspy but bogus raving story about N random broken people.
   
   Here is a classic example of the saga form, as told by Guy L. Steele:
   
     Jon L. White (login name JONL) and I (GLS) were office mates at MIT
     for many years. One April, we both flew from Boston to California
     for a week on research business, to consult face-to-face with some
     people at Stanford, particularly our mutual friend Richard P.
     Gabriel (RPG; see [11736]gabriel).
     
     RPG picked us up at the San Francisco airport and drove us back to
     Palo Alto (going [11737]logical south on route 101, parallel to
     [11738]El Camino Bignum). Palo Alto is adjacent to Stanford
     University and about 40 miles south of San Francisco. We ate at The
     Good Earth, a `health food' restaurant, very popular, the sort
     whose milkshakes all contain honey and protein powder. JONL ordered
     such a shake -- the waitress claimed the flavor of the day was
     "lalaberry". I still have no idea what that might be, but it became
     a running joke. It was the color of raspberry, and JONL said it
     tasted rather bitter. I ate a better tostada there than I have ever
     had in a Mexican restaurant.
     
     After this we went to the local Uncle Gaylord's Old Fashioned Ice
     Cream Parlor. They make ice cream fresh daily, in a variety of
     intriguing flavors. It's a chain, and they have a slogan: "If you
     don't live near an Uncle Gaylord's -- MOVE!" Also, Uncle Gaylord (a
     real person) wages a constant battle to force big-name ice cream
     makers to print their ingredients on the package (like air and
     plastic and other non-natural garbage). JONL and I had first
     discovered Uncle Gaylord's the previous August, when we had flown
     to a computer-science conference in Berkeley, California, the first
     time either of us had been on the West Coast. When not in the
     conference sessions, we had spent our time wandering the length of
     Telegraph Avenue, which (like Harvard Square in Cambridge) was
     lined with picturesque street vendors and interesting little shops.
     On that street we discovered Uncle Gaylord's Berkeley store. The
     ice cream there was very good. During that August visit JONL went
     absolutely bananas (so to speak) over one particular flavor, ginger
     honey.
     
     Therefore, after eating at The Good Earth -- indeed, after every
     lunch and dinner and before bed during our April visit -- a trip to
     Uncle Gaylord's (the one in Palo Alto) was mandatory. We had
     arrived on a Wednesday, and by Thursday evening we had been there
     at least four times. Each time, JONL would get ginger honey ice
     cream, and proclaim to all bystanders that "Ginger was the spice
     that drove the Europeans mad! That's why they sought a route to the
     East! They used it to preserve their otherwise off-taste meat."
     After the third or fourth repetition RPG and I were getting a
     little tired of this spiel, and began to paraphrase him: "Wow!
     Ginger! The spice that makes rotten meat taste good!" "Say! Why
     don't we find some dog that's been run over and sat in the sun for
     a week and put some ginger on it for dinner?!" "Right! With a
     lalaberry shake!" And so on. This failed to faze JONL; he took it
     in good humor, as long as we kept returning to Uncle Gaylord's. He
     loves ginger honey ice cream.
     
     Now RPG and his then-wife KBT (Kathy Tracy) were putting us up
     (putting up with us?) in their home for our visit, so to thank them
     JONL and I took them out to a nice French restaurant of their
     choosing. I unadventurously chose the filet mignon, and KBT had je
     ne sais quoi du jour, but RPG and JONL had lapin (rabbit).
     (Waitress: "Oui, we have fresh rabbit, fresh today." RPG: "Well,
     JONL, I guess we won't need any ginger!")
     
     We finished the meal late, about 11 P.M., which is 2 A.M Boston
     time, so JONL and I were rather droopy. But it wasn't yet midnight.
     Off to Uncle Gaylord's!
     
     Now the French restaurant was in Redwood City, north of Palo Alto.
     In leaving Redwood City, we somehow got onto route 101 going north
     instead of south. JONL and I wouldn't have known the difference had
     RPG not mentioned it. We still knew very little of the local
     geography. I did figure out, however, that we were headed in the
     direction of Berkeley, and half-jokingly suggested that we continue
     north and go to Uncle Gaylord's in Berkeley.
     
     RPG said "Fine!" and we drove on for a while and talked. I was
     drowsy, and JONL actually dropped off to sleep for 5 minutes. When
     he awoke, RPG said, "Gee, JONL, you must have slept all the way
     over the bridge!", referring to the one spanning San Francisco Bay.
     Just then we came to a sign that said "University Avenue". I
     mumbled something about working our way over to Telegraph Avenue;
     RPG said "Right!" and maneuvered some more. Eventually we pulled up
     in front of an Uncle Gaylord's.
     
     Now, I hadn't really been paying attention because I was so sleepy,
     and I didn't really understand what was happening until RPG let me
     in on it a few moments later, but I was just alert enough to notice
     that we had somehow come to the Palo Alto Uncle Gaylord's after
     all.
     
     JONL noticed the resemblance to the Palo Alto store, but hadn't
     caught on. (The place is lit with red and yellow lights at night,
     and looks much different from the way it does in daylight.) He
     said, "This isn't the Uncle Gaylord's I went to in Berkeley! It
     looked like a barn! But this place looks just like the one back in
     Palo Alto!"
     
     RPG deadpanned, "Well, this is the one I always come to when I'm in
     Berkeley. They've got two in San Francisco, too. Remember, they're
     a chain."
     
     JONL accepted this bit of wisdom. And he was not totally ignorant
     -- he knew perfectly well that University Avenue was in Berkeley,
     not far from Telegraph Avenue. What he didn't know was that there
     is a completely different University Avenue in Palo Alto.
     
     JONL went up to the counter and asked for ginger honey. The guy at
     the counter asked whether JONL would like to taste it first,
     evidently their standard procedure with that flavor, as not too
     many people like it.
     
     JONL said, "I'm sure I like it. Just give me a cone." The guy
     behind the counter insisted that JONL try just a taste first. "Some
     people think it tastes like soap." JONL insisted, "Look, I love
     ginger. I eat Chinese food. I eat raw ginger roots. I already went
     through this hassle with the guy back in Palo Alto. I know I like
     that flavor!"
     
     At the words "back in Palo Alto" the guy behind the counter got a
     very strange look on his face, but said nothing. KBT caught his eye
     and winked. Through my stupor I still hadn't quite grasped what was
     going on, and thought RPG was rolling on the floor laughing and
     clutching his stomach just because JONL had launched into his spiel
     ("makes rotten meat a dish for princes") for the forty-third time.
     At this point, RPG clued me in fully.
     
     RPG, KBT, and I retreated to a table, trying to stifle our
     chuckles. JONL remained at the counter, talking about ice cream
     with the guy b.t.c., comparing Uncle Gaylord's to other ice cream
     shops and generally having a good old time.
     
     At length the g.b.t.c. said, "How's the ginger honey?" JONL said,
     "Fine! I wonder what exactly is in it?" Now Uncle Gaylord publishes
     all his recipes and even teaches classes on how to make his ice
     cream at home. So the g.b.t.c. got out the recipe, and he and JONL
     pored over it for a while. But the g.b.t.c. could contain his
     curiosity no longer, and asked again, "You really like that stuff,
     huh?" JONL said, "Yeah, I've been eating it constantly back in Palo
     Alto for the past two days. In fact, I think this batch is about as
     good as the cones I got back in Palo Alto!"
     
     G.b.t.c. looked him straight in the eye and said, "You're in Palo
     Alto!"
     
     JONL turned slowly around, and saw the three of us collapse in a
     fit of giggles. He clapped a hand to his forehead and exclaimed,
     "I've been hacked!"

   [Ironic footnote: the [11739]meme about ginger vs. rotting meat is an
   urban legend. It's not borne out by an examination of medieval recipes
   or period purchase records for spices, and appears full-blown in the
   works of Samuel Pegge, a gourmand and notorious flake case who
   originated numerous food myths. The truth seems to be that ginger was
   used to cover not rot but the extreme salt taste of meat packed in
   brine, which was the best method available before refrigeration.

   [from the nuclear power industry] An emergency-power-off switch (see

   A correspondent reports a legend that "Scram" is an acronym for "Start
   Cutting Right Away, Man" (another less plausible variant of this
   legend refers to "Safety Control Rod Axe Man"; these are almost
   certainly both [11861]backronyms). The story goes that in the earliest
   nuclear power experiments the engineers recognized the possibility
   that the reactor wouldn't behave exactly as predicted by their
   mathematical models. Accordingly, they made sure that they had
   mechanisms in place that would rapidly drop the control rods back into
   the reactor. One mechanism took the form of `scram technicians'. These
   individuals stood next to the ropes or cables that raised and lowered
   the control rods. Equipped with axes or cable-cutters, these
   technicians stood ready for the (literal) `scram' command. If
   necessary, they would cut the cables, and gravity would expeditiously
   return the control rods to the reactor, thereby averting yet another
   kind of [11862]core dump.
   
   Modern reactor control rods are held in place with claw-like devices,
   held closed by current. SCRAM switches are circuit breakers that
   immediately open the circuit to the rod arms, resulting in the rapid
   insertion and subsequent bottoming of the control rods.

   monkey", a proverb used to advise caution when dealing with
   irreplaceable data or devices. Used to refer to any scratch volume
   hooked to a computer during any risky operation as a replacement for
   some precious resource or data that might otherwise get trashed.
   
   This term preserves the memory of Mabel, the Swimming Wonder Monkey,
   star of a biological research program at the University of Toronto.
   Mabel was not (so the legend goes) your ordinary monkey; the
   university had spent years teaching her how to swim, breathing through
   a regulator, in order to study the effects of different gas mixtures
   on her physiology. Mabel suffered an untimely demise one day when a
   [11872]DEC [11873]field circus engineer troubleshooting a crash on the
   program's VAX inadvertently interfered with some custom hardware that
   was wired to Mabel.
   
   It is reported that, after calming down an understandably irate
   customer sufficiently to ascertain the facts of the matter, a DEC
   troubleshooter called up the [11874]field circus manager responsible
   and asked him sweetly, "Can you swim?"
   
   Not all the consequences to humans were so amusing; the sysop of the
   machine in question was nearly thrown in jail at the behest of certain
   clueless [11875]droids at the local `humane' society. The moral is
   clear: When in doubt, always mount a scratch monkey.
   
   [The actual incident occured in 1979 or 1980. There is a version of
   this story, complete with reported dialogue between one of the project
   people and DEC field service, that has been circulating on Internet
   since 1986. It is hilarious and mythic, but gets some facts wrong. For
   example, it reports the machine as a PDP-11 and alleges that Mabel's
   demise occurred when DEC [11876]PMed the machine. Earlier versions of
   this entry were based on that story; this one has been corrected from

   (sometimes, more euphoniously, `second-system syndrome') When one is
   designing the successor to a relatively small, elegant, and successful
   system, there is a tendency to become grandiose in one's success and
   design an [11946]elephantine feature-laden monstrosity. The term was
   first used by Fred Brooks in his classic "The Mythical Man-Month:
   Essays on Software Engineering" (Addison-Wesley, 1975; ISBN
   0-201-00650-2). It described the jump from a set of nice, simple
   operating systems on the IBM 70xx series to OS/360 on the 360 series.
   A similar effect can also happen in an evolving system; see
   [11947]Brooks's Law, [11948]creeping elegance, [11949]creeping
   featurism. See also [11950]Multics, [11951]OS/2, [11952]X,
   [11953]software bloat.

   amok on jargon-1....

   When a fatal error occurs (esp. a [11957]segfault) the immediate cause
   may be that a pointer has been trashed due to a previous
   [11958]fandango on core. However, this fandango may have been due to
   an earlier fandango, so no amount of analysis will reveal (directly)
   how the damage occurred. "The data structure was clobbered, but it was
   secondary damage."
   
   By extension, the corruption resulting from N cascaded fandangoes on
   core is `Nth-level damage'. There is at least one case on record in
   which 17 hours of [11959]grovelling with adb actually dug up the
   underlying bug behind an instance of seventh-level damage! The hacker
   who accomplished this near-superhuman feat was presented with an award
   by his fellows.

   Previous:[11961]secondary damage, Up:[11962]= S =
   
   security through obscurity
   
   (alt. `security by obscurity') A term applied by hackers to most OS
   vendors' favorite way of coping with security holes -- namely,
   ignoring them, documenting neither any known holes nor the underlying
   security algorithms, trusting that nobody will find out about them and
   that people who do find out about them won't exploit them. This
   "strategy" never works for long and occasionally sets the world up for
   debacles like the [11963]RTM worm of 1988 (see [11964]Great Worm), but
   once the brief moments of panic created by such events subside most
   vendors are all too willing to turn over and go back to sleep. After
   all, actually fixing the bugs would siphon off the resources needed to
   implement the next user-interface frill on marketing's wish list --
   and besides, if they started fixing security bugs customers might
   begin to expect it and imagine that their warranties of
   merchantability gave them some sort of right to a system with fewer
   holes in it than a shotgunned Swiss cheese, and then where would we
   be?
   
   Historical note: There are conflicting stories about the origin of
   this term. It has been claimed that it was first used in the Usenet
   newsgroup in comp.sys.apollo during a campaign to get HP/Apollo to fix
   security problems in its Unix-[11965]clone Aegis/DomainOS (they didn't
   change a thing). [11966]ITS fans, on the other hand, say it was coined
   years earlier in opposition to the incredibly paranoid [11967]Multics
   people down the hall, for whom security was everything. In the ITS
   culture it referred to (1) the fact that by the time a tourist figured
   out how to make trouble he'd generally gotten over the urge to make
   it, because he felt part of the community; and (2) (self-mockingly)
   the poor coverage of the documentation and obscurity of many commands.
   One instance of deliberate security through obscurity is recorded; the
   command to allow patching the running ITS system (escape escape
   control-R) echoed as $$^D. If you actually typed alt alt ^D, that set
   a flag that would prevent patching the system even if you later got it
   right.

   [Sun Users' Group & elsewhere] n. 1. Software EXchange. A technique
   invented by the blue-green algae hundreds of millions of years ago to
   speed up their evolution, which had been terribly slow up until then.
   Today, SEX parties are popular among hackers and others (of course,
   these are no longer limited to exchanges of genetic software). In
   general, SEX parties are a [12030]Good Thing, but unprotected SEX can
   propagate a [12031]virus. See also [12032]pubic directory. 2. The
   rather Freudian mnemonic often used for Sign EXtend, a machine
   instruction found in the PDP-11 and many other architectures. The RCA
   1802 chip used in the early Elf and SuperElf personal computers had a
   `SEt X register' SEX instruction, but this seems to have had little
   folkloric impact. The Data General instruction set also had SEX.
   
   [12033]DEC's engineers nearly got a PDP-11 assembler that used the SEX
   mnemonic out the door at one time, but (for once) marketing wasn't
   asleep and forced a change. That wasn't the last time this happened,
   either. The author of "The Intel 8086 Primer", who was one of the
   original designers of the 8086, noted that there was originally a SEX
   instruction on that processor, too. He says that Intel management got
   cold feet and decreed that it be changed, and thus the instruction was
   renamed CBW and CWD (depending on what was being extended). Amusingly,
   the Intel 8048 (the microcontroller used in IBM PC keyboards) is also
   missing straight SEX but has logical-or and logical-and instructions
   ORL and ANL.
   
   The Motorola 6809, used in the Radio Shack Color Computer and in
   U.K.'s `Dragon 32' personal computer, actually had an official SEX
   instruction; the 6502 in the Apple II with which it competed did not.
   British hackers thought this made perfect mythic sense; after all, it
   was commonly observed, you could (on some theoretical level) have sex
   with a dragon, but you can't have sex with an apple.

   through a standard Unix shell; thus, a sharchive can be distributed to

   Sharchives are also intriguing in that they are typically created by
   shell scripts; the script that produces sharchives is thus a script
   which produces self-unpacking scripts, which may themselves contain
   scripts. (The downsides of sharchives are that they are an ideal venue

   techspeak, widely propagated via Unix] 1. [techspeak] The command

   because it is the part of the operating system that interfaces with
   the outside world. 2. More generally, any interface program that
   mediates access to a special resource or [12082]server for
   convenience, efficiency, or security reasons; for this meaning, the
   usage is usually `a shell around' whatever. This sort of program is
   also called a `wrapper'. 3. A skeleton program, created by hand or by
   another program (like, say, a parser generator), which provides the
   necessary [12083]incantations to set up some task and the control flow
   to drive it (the term [12084]driver is sometimes used synonymously).
   The user is meant to fill in whatever code is needed to get real work
   done. This usage is common in the AI and Microsoft Windows worlds, and
   confuses Unix hackers.
   
   Historical note: Apparently, the original Multics shell (sense 1) was
   so called because it was a shell (sense 3); it ran user programs not
   by starting up separate processes, but by dynamically linking the
   programs into its own code, calling them as subroutines, and then
   dynamically de-linking them on return. The VMS command interpreter
   still does something very like this.

   is the cause of all network slowdown. Often heard as in "Freela casts
   a tac nuke at Shub-Internet for slowing her down." (A forged response

   outgoing mail and news. The composition of one's sig can be quite an

   a waste of [12143]bandwidth, and it has been observed that the size of

   A parasitic [12152]meme embedded in a [12153]sig block. There was a
   [12154]meme plague or fad for these on Usenet in late 1991. Most were
   equivalents of "I am a .sig virus. Please reproduce me in your .sig
   block.". Of course, the .sig virus's memetic hook is the giggle value
   of going along with the gag; this, however, was a self-limiting
   phenomenon as more and more people picked up on the idea. There were
   creative variants on it; some people stuck `sig virus antibody' texts
   in their sigs, and there was at least one instance of a sig virus

   Used by hackers in a generalization of its technical meaning. `Signal'
   refers to useful information conveyed by some communications medium,
   and `noise' to anything else on that medium. Hence a low ratio implies
   that it is not worth paying attention to the medium in question.

   [Unix/Internet] The unique electronic name of a computer system, used
   to identify it in UUCP mail, Usenet, or other forms of electronic

   the creativity and humor they often display. Interpreting a sitename
   is not unlike interpreting a vanity license plate; one has to mentally
   unpack it, allowing for mono-case and length restrictions and the lack
   of whitespace. Hacker tradition deprecates dull,
   institutional-sounding names in favor of punchy, humorous, and clever
   coinages (except that it is considered appropriate for the official
   public gateway machine of an organization to bear the organization's
   name or acronym). Mythological references, cartoon characters, animal
   names, and allusions to SF or fantasy literature are probably the most
   popular sources for sitenames (in roughly descending order). The
   obligatory comment when discussing these is Harris's Lament: "All the
