 all your work;
005:014 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God:
        [in it] you shall not do any work, you, nor your son,
        nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant,
        nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your livestock,
        nor your stranger who is within your gates; that your male
        servant and your female servant may rest as well as you.
005:015 You shall remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt,
        and Yahweh your God brought you out of there by a mighty
        hand and by an outstretched arm:  therefore Yahweh your God
        commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.
005:016 "Honor your father and your mother, as Yahweh your God commanded you;
        that your days may be long, and that it may go well with you,
        in the land which Yahweh your God gives you.
005:017 "You shall not murder.
005:018 "Neither shall you commit adultery.
005:019 "Neither shall you steal.
005:020 "Neither shall you give false testimony against your neighbor.
005:021 "Neither shall you covet your neighbor's wife; neither shall you
        desire your neighbor's house, his field, or his male servant,
        or his female servant, his ox, or his donkey, or anything
        that is your neighbor's."
005:022 These words Yahweh spoke to all your assembly on the mountain
        out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the
        thick darkness, with a great voice:  and he added no more.
        He wrote them on two tables of stone, and gave them to me.
005:023 It happened, when you heard the voice out of the midst
        of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire,
        that you came near to me, even all the heads of your tribes,
        and your elders;
005:024 and you said, Behold, Yahweh our God has shown us his glory
        and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst
        of the fire:  we have seen this day that God does speak with man,
        and he lives.
005:025 Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will
        consume us:  if we hear the voice of Yahweh our God any more,
        then we shall die.
005:026 For who is there of all flesh, that has heard the voice
        of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire,
        as we have, and lived?
005:027 Go you near, and hear all that Yahweh our God shall say:
        and speak you to us all that Yahweh our God shall speak to you;
        and we will hear it, and do it.
005:028 Yahweh heard the voice of your words, when you spoke to me;
        and Yahweh said to me, I have heard the voice of the words
        of this people, which they have spoken to you:
        they have well said all that they have spoken.
005:029 Oh that there were such a heart in them, that they would fear me,
        and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well
        with them, and with their children forever!
005:030 Go tell them, Return you to your tents.
005:031 But as for you, stand you here by me, and I will speak to you
        all the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances,
        which you shall teach them, that they may do them in the land
        which I give them to possess it.
005:032 You shall observe to do therefore as Yahweh your God has
        commanded you:  you shall not turn aside to the right hand
        or to the left.
005:033 You shall walk in all the way which Yahweh your God has
        commanded you, that you may live, and that it may be well
        with you, and that you may prolong your days in the land
        which you shall possess.
006:001 Now this is the commandment, the statutes, and the ordinances,
        which Yahweh your God commanded to teach you, that you might
        do them in the land where you go over to possess it;
006:002 that you might fear Yahweh your God, to keep all his statutes
        and his commandments, which I command you, you, and your son,
        and your son's son, all the days of your life; and that your
        days may be prolonged.
006:003 Hear therefore, Israel, and observe to do it; that it
        may be well with you, and that you may increase mightily,
        as Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has promised to you,
        in a land flowing with milk and honey.
006:004 Hear, Israel:  Yahweh is our God; Yahweh is one:
006:005 and you shall love Yahweh your God with all your heart,
        and with all your soul, and with all your might.
006:006 These words, which I command you this day, shall be on your heart;
006:007 and you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall
        talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk
        by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up.
006:008 You shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall
        be for symbols between your eyes.
006:009 You shall write them on the door posts of your house,
        and on your gates.
006:010 It shall be, when Yahweh your God shall bring you into
        the land which he swore to your fathers, to Abraham,
        to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give you, great and goodly cities,
        which you didn't build,
006:011 and houses full of all good things, which you didn't fill,
        and cisterns dug out, which you didn't dig, vineyards and
        olive trees, which you didn't plant, and you shall eat
        and be full;
006:012 then beware lest you forget Yahweh, who brought you forth
        out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
006:013 You shall fear Yahweh your God; and him shall you serve,
        and shall swear by his name.
006:014 You shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the peoples
        who are round about you;
006:015 for Yahweh your God in the midst of you is a jealous God;
        lest the anger of Yahweh your God be kindled against you,
        and he destroy you from off the face of the earth.
006:016 You shall not tempt Yahweh your God, as you tempted him in Massah.
006:017 You shall diligently keep the commandments of Yahweh your God,
        and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he has commanded you.
006:018 You shall do that which is right and good in the sight of Yahweh;
        that it may be well with you, and that you may go in and possess
        the good land which Yahweh swore to your fathers,
006:019 to thrust out all your enemies from before you, as Yahweh has spoken.
006:020 When your son asks you in time to come, saying, What mean
        the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances,
        which Yahweh our God has commanded you?
006:021 then you shall tell your son, We were Pharaoh's bondservants
        in Egypt:  and Yahweh brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand;
006:022 and Yahweh showed great and awesome signs and wonders on Egypt,
        on Pharaoh, and on all his house, before our eyes;
006:023 and he brought us out from there, that he might bring us in,
        to give us the land which he swore to our fathers.
006:024 Yahweh commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear Yahweh
        our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive,
        as at this day.
006:025 It shall be righteousness to us, if we observe to do all this
        commandment before Yahweh our God, as he has commanded us.
007:001 When Yahweh your God shall bring you into the land where you
        go to possess it, and shall cast out many nations before you,
        the Hittite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Canaanite,
        and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite,
        seven nations greater and mightier than you;
007:002 and when Yahweh your God shall deliver them up before you,
        and you shall strike them; then you shall utterly destroy them:
        you shall make no covenant with them, nor show mercy to them;
007:003 neither shall you make marriages with them; your daughter you
        shall not give to his son, nor his daughter shall you take
        to your son.
007:004 For he will turn away your son from following me, that they
        may serve other gods:  so will the anger of Yahweh be kindled
        against you, and he will destroy you quickly.
007:005 But thus shall you deal with them:  you shall break down their altars,
        and dash in pieces their pillars, and hew down their Asherim,
        and burn their engraved images with fire.
007:006 For you are a holy people to Yahweh your God:  Yahweh your
        God has chosen you to be a people for his own possession,
        above all peoples who are on the face of the earth.
007:007 Yahweh didn't set his love on you, nor choose you, because you
        were more in number than any people; for you were the fewest
        of all peoples:
007:008 but because Yahweh loves you, and because he would keep the oath
        which he swore to your fathers, has Yahweh brought you out with
        a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage,
        from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
007:009 Know therefore that Yahweh your God, he is God, the faithful God,
        who keeps covenant and loving kindness with them who love
        him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations,
007:010 and repays those who hate him to their face, to destroy them:
        he will not be slack to him who hates him, he will repay him
        to his face.
007:011 You shall therefore keep the commandment, and the statutes,
        and the ordinances, which I command you this day, to do them.
007:012 It shall happen, because you listen to these ordinances,
        and keep and do them, that Yahweh your God will keep with
        you the covenant and the loving kindness which he swore
        to your fathers:
007:013 and he will love you, and bless you, and multiply you;
        he will also bless the fruit of your body and the fruit
        of your ground, your grain and your new wine and your oil,
        the increase of your livestock and the young of your flock,
        in the land which he swore to your fathers to give you.
007:014 You shall be blessed above all peoples:  there shall not be
        male or female barren among you, or among your livestock.
007:015 Yahweh will take away from you all sickness; and none of the evil
        diseases of Egypt, which you know, he will put on you,
        but will lay them on all those who hate you.
007:016 You shall consume all the peoples whom Yahweh your God
        shall deliver to you; your eye shall not pity them:
        neither shall you serve their gods; for that will be a
        snare to you.
007:017 If you shall say in your heart, These nations are more than I;
        how can I dispossess them?
007:018 you shall not be afraid of them:  you shall well remember
        what Yahweh your God did to Pharaoh, and to all Egypt;
007:019 the great trials which your eyes saw, and the signs,
        and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm,
        by which Yahweh your God brought you out:  so shall Yahweh
        your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid.
007:020 Moreover Yahweh your God will send the hornet among them,
        until those who are left, and hide themselves,
        perish from before you.
007:021 You shall not be scared of them; for Yahweh your God is in
        the midst of you, a great and awesome God.
007:022 Yahweh your God will cast out those nations before you
        by little and little:  you may not consume them at once,
        lest the animals of the field increase on you.
007:023 But Yahweh your God will deliver them up before you, and will
        confuse them with a great confusion, until they be destroyed.
007:024 He will deliver their kings into your hand, and you
        shall make their name to perish from under the sky:
        there shall no man be able to stand before you, until you
        have destroyed them.
007:025 The engraved images of their gods shall you burn with fire:
        you shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them,
        nor take it to you, lest you be snared therein; for it is
        an abomination to Yahweh your God.
007:026 You shall not bring an abomination into your house, and become
        a devoted thing like it:  you shall utterly detest it,
        and you shall utterly abhor it; for it is a devoted thing.
008:001 All the commandment which I command you this day shall you
        observe to do, that you may live, and multiply, and go
        in and possess the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers.
008:002 You shall remember all the way which Yahweh your God has led you
        these forty years in the wilderness, that he might humble you,
        to prove you, to know what was in your heart, whether you
        would keep his commandments, or not.
008:003 He humbled you, and allowed you to hunger, and fed you with manna,
        which you didn't know, neither did your fathers know;
        that he might make you know that man does not live by bread only,
        but by everything that proceeds out of the mouth of Yahweh
        does man live.
008:004 Your clothing didn't grow old on you, neither did your foot swell,
        these forty years.
008:005 You shall consider in your heart that as a man chastens his son,
        so Yahweh your God chastens you.
008:006 You shall keep the commandments of Yahweh your God, to walk
        in his ways, and to fear him.
008:007 For Yahweh your God brings you into a good land, a land
        of brooks of water, of springs, and underground water flowing
        into valleys and hills;
008:008 a land of wheat and barley, and vines and fig trees and pomegranates;
        a land of olive trees and honey;
008:009 a land in which you shall eat bread without scarceness,
        you shall not lack anything in it; a land whose stones are iron,
        and out of whose hills you may dig copper.
008:010 You shall eat and be full, and you shall bless Yahweh your God
        for the good land which he has given you.
008:011 Beware lest you forget Yahweh your God, in not keeping
        his commandments, and his ordinances, and his statutes,
        which I command you this day:
008:012 lest, when you have eaten and are full, and have built
        goodly houses, and lived therein;
008:013 and when your herds and your flocks multiply, and your silver
        and your gold is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied;
008:014 then your heart be lifted up, and you forget Yahweh your God,
        who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, out of
        the house of bondage;
008:015 who led you through the great and terrible wilderness,
        [in which were] fiery serpents and scorpions, and thirsty
        ground where was no water; who brought you forth water out
        of the rock of flint;
008:016 who fed you in the wilderness with manna, which your fathers
        didn't know; that he might humble you, and that he might prove you,
        to do you good at your latter end:
008:017 and [lest] you say in your heart, My power and the might of my
        hand has gotten me this wealth.
008:018 But you shall remember Yahweh your God, for it is he who gives
        you power to get wealth; that he may establish his covenant
        which he swore to your fathers, as at this day.
008:019 It shall be, if you shall forget Yahweh your God, and walk
        after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify
        against you this day that you shall surely perish.
008:020 As the nations that Yahweh makes to perish before you,
        so shall you perish; because you wouldn't listen to the voice
        of Yahweh your God.
009:001 Hear, Israel:  you are to pass over the Jordan this day, to go
        in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourself,
        cities great and fortified up to the sky,
009:002 a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom you know,
        and of whom you have heard say, Who can stand before
        the sons of Anak?
009:003 Know therefore this day, that Yahweh your God is he who goes
        over before you as a devouring fire; he will destroy them,
        and he will bring them down before you:  so shall you drive
        them out, and make them to perish quickly, as Yahweh has
        spoken to you.
009:004 Don't speak in your heart, after that Yahweh your God
        has thrust them out from before you, saying, For my
        righteousness Yahweh has brought me in to possess this land;
        whereas for the wickedness of these nations Yahweh does drive
        them out from before you.
009:005 Not for your righteousness, or for the uprightness of your heart,
        do you go in to possess their land; but for the wickedness
        of these nations Yahweh your God does drive them out from
        before you, and that he may establish the word which Yahweh
        swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
009:006 Know therefore, that Yahweh your God doesn't give you this
        good land to possess it for your righteousness; for you are
        a stiff-necked people.
009:007 Remember, don't forget, how you provoked Yahweh your God
        to wrath in the wilderness:  from the day that you went forth
        out of the land of Egypt, until you came to this place,
        you have been rebellious against Yahweh.
009:008 Also in Horeb you provoked Yahweh to wrath, and Yahweh was angry
        with you to destroy you.
009:009 When I was gone up onto the mountain to receive the tables of stone,
        even the tables of the covenant which Yahweh made with you,
        then I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights;
        I did neither eat bread nor drink water.
009:010 Yahweh delivered to me the two tables of stone written
        with the finger of God; and on them [was written] according
        to all the words, which Yahweh spoke with you on the mountain
        out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.
009:011 It came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights,
        that Yahweh gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables
        of the covenant.
009:012 Yahweh said to me, Arise, get you down quickly from hence;
        for your people whom you have brought forth out of Egypt
        have corrupted themselves; they have quickly turned aside
        out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them
        a molten image.
009:013 Furthermore Yahweh spoke to me, saying, I have seen this people,
        and behold, it is a stiff-necked people:
009:014 let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name
        from under the sky; and I will make of you a nation mightier
        and greater than they.
009:015 So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain
        was burning with fire:  and the two tables of the covenant
        were in my two hands.
009:016 I looked, and behold, you had sinned against Yahweh your God;
        you had made you a molten calf:  you had turned aside quickly
        out of the way which Yahweh had commanded you.
009:017 I took hold of the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands,
        and broke them before your eyes.
009:018 I fell down before Yahweh, as at the first, forty days
        and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water;
        because of all your sin which you sinned, in doing that which
        was evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger.
009:019 For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure,
        with which Yahweh was angry against you to destroy you.
        But Yahweh listened to me that time also.
009:020 Yahweh was very angry with Aaron to destroy him:
        and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.
009:021 I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burnt it
        with fire, and stamped it, grinding it very small, until it
        was as fine as dust:  and I cast the dust of it into the brook
        that descended out of the mountain.
009:022 At Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth Hattaavah,
        you provoked Yahweh to wrath.
009:023 When Yahweh sent you from Kadesh Barnea, saying, Go up and possess
        the land which I have given you; then you rebelled against
        the commandment of Yahweh your God, and you didn't believe him,
        nor listen to his voice.
009:024 You have been rebellious against Yahweh from the day that
        I knew you.
009:025 So I fell down before Yahweh the forty days and forty nights
        that I fell down, because Yahweh had said he would destroy you.
009:026 I prayed to Yahweh, and said, Lord Yahweh, don't destroy your
        people and your inheritance, that you have redeemed through
        your greatness, that you have brought forth out of Egypt
        with a mighty hand.
009:027 Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; don't look
        to the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness,
        nor to their sin,
009:028 lest the land whence you brought us out say, Because Yahweh was
        not able to bring them into the land which he promised to them,
        and because he hated them, he has brought them out to kill
        them in the wilderness.
009:029 Yet they are your people and your inheritance, which you brought
        out by your great power and by your outstretched arm.
010:001 At that time Yahweh said to me, Hew you two tables of stone
        like the first, and come up to me onto the mountain,
        and make an ark of wood.
010:002 I will write on the tables the words that were on the first
        tables which you broke, and you shall put them in the ark.
010:003 So I made an ark of acacia wood, and hewed two tables
        of stone like the first, and went up onto the mountain,
        having the two tables in my hand.
010:004 He wrote on the tables, according to the first writing,
        the ten commandments, which Yahweh spoke to you on the mountain
        out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly:
        and Yahweh gave them to me.
010:005 I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tables
        in the ark which I had made; and there they are as
        Yahweh commanded me.
010:006 (The children of Israel traveled from Beeroth Bene Jaakan to Moserah.
        There Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son
        ministered in the priest's office in his place.
010:007 From there they traveled to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah
        to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water.
010:008 At that time Yahweh set apart the tribe of Levi, to bear
        the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, to stand before Yahweh
        to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day.
010:009 Therefore Levi has no portion nor inheritance with his brothers;
        Yahweh is his inheritance, according as Yahweh your God
        spoke to him.)
010:010 I stayed on the mountain, as at the first time, forty days
        and forty nights:  and Yahweh listened to me that time also;
        Yahweh would not destroy you.
010:011 Yahweh said to me, Arise, take your journey before the people;
        and they shall go in and possess the land, which I swore
        to their fathers to give to them.
010:012 Now, Israel, what does Yahweh your God require of you,
        but to fear Yahweh your God, to walk in all his ways,
        and to love him, and to serve Yahweh your God with all your
        heart and with all your soul,
010:013 to keep the commandments of Yahweh, and his statutes, which I
        command you this day for your good?
010:014 Behold, to Yahweh your God belongs heaven and the heaven
        of heavens, the earth, with all that is therein.
010:015 Only Yahweh had a delight in your fathers to love them,
        and he chose their seed after them, even you above all peoples,
        as at this day.
010:016 Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be
        no more stiff-necked.
010:017 For Yahweh your God, he is God of gods, and Lord of lords,
        the great God, the mighty, and the awesome, who doesn't
        regard persons, nor takes reward.
010:018 He does execute justice for the fatherless and widow,
        and loves the foreigner, in giving him food and clothing.
010:019 Therefore love the foreigner; for you were foreigners in
        the land of Egypt.
010:020 You shall fear Yahweh your God; him shall you serve;
        and to him shall you cleave, and by his name shall you swear.
010:021 He is your praise, and he is your God, who has done for you
        these great and awesome things, which your eyes have seen.
010:022 Your fathers went down into Egypt with seventy persons;
        and now Yahweh your God has made you as the stars of the
        sky for multitude.
011:001 Therefore you shall love Yahweh your God, and keep his charge,
        and his statutes, and his ordinances, and his commandments, always.
011:002 Know you this day:  for I don't speak with your children
        who have not known, and who have not seen the chastisement
        of Yahweh your God, his greatness, his mighty hand,
        and his outstretched arm,
011:003 and his signs, and his works, which he did in the midst of Egypt
        to Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and to all his land;
011:004 and what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses, and to
        their chariots; how he made the water of the Red Sea{or, Sea of
        Reeds} to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how
        Yahweh has destroyed them to this day;
011:005 and what he did to you in the wilderness, until you came
        to this place;
011:006 and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab,
        the son of Reuben; how the earth opened its mouth,
        and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents,
        and every living thing that followed them, in the midst
        of all Israel:
011:007 but your eyes have seen all the great work of Yahweh which he did.
011:008 Therefore shall you keep all the commandment which I command
        you this day, that you may be strong, and go in and possess
        the land, where you go over to possess it;
011:009 and that you may prolong your days in the land, which Yahweh
        swore to your fathers to give to them and to their seed,
        a land flowing with milk and honey.
011:010 For the land, where you go in to possess it, isn't as the land
        of Egypt, from whence you came out, where you sowed your seed,
        and watered it with your foot, as a garden of herbs;
011:011 but the land, where you go over to possess it, is a land of hills
        and valleys, [and] drinks water of the rain of the sky,
011:012 a land which Yahweh your God cares for:  the eyes of Yahweh
        your God are always on it, from the beginning of the year
        even to the end of the year.
011:013 It shall happen, if you shall listen diligently to my commandments
        which I command you this day, to love Yahweh your God,
        and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,
011:014 that I will give the rain of your land in its season, the former
        rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your grain,
        and your new wine, and your oil.
011:015 I will give grass in your fields for your livestock, and you
        shall eat and be full.
011:016 Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and you
        turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;
011:017 and the anger of Yahweh be kindled against you, and he shut
        up the sky, so that there shall be no rain, and the land
        shall not yield its fruit; and you perish quickly from off
        the good land which Yahweh gives you.
011:018 Therefore shall you lay up these my words in your heart and in
        your soul; and you shall bind them for a sign on your hand,
        and they shall be for symbols between your eyes.
011:019 You shall teach them your children, talking of them,
        when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way,
        and when you lie down, and when you rise up.
011:020 You shall write them on the door posts of your house,
        and on your gates;
011:021 that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children,
        in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give them,
        as the days of the heavens above the earth.
011:022 For if you shall diligently keep all this commandment which I
        command you, to do it, to love Yahweh your God, to walk
        in all his ways, and to cleave to him;
011:023 then will Yahweh drive out all these nations from before you, and you
        shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves.
011:024 Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall
        be yours:  from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river,
        the river Euphrates, even to the hinder sea shall be your border.
011:025 There shall no man be able to stand before you:
        Yahweh your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread
        of you on all the land that you shall tread on, as he has
        spoken to you.
011:026 Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse:
011:027 the blessing, if you shall listen to the commandments of Yahweh
        your God, which I command you this day;
011:028 and the curse, if you shall not listen to the commandments
        of Yahweh your God, but turn aside out of the way which I
        command you this day, to go after other gods, which you
        have not known.
011:029 It shall happen, when Yahweh your God shall bring you into
        the land where you go to possess it, that you shall set
        the blessing on Mount Gerizim, and the curse on Mount Ebal.
011:030 Aren't they beyond the Jordan, behind the way of the going
        down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites who dwell
        in the Arabah, over against Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh?
011:031 For you are to pass over the Jordan to go in to possess the land
        which Yahweh your God gives you, and you shall possess it,
        and dwell therein.
011:032 You shall observe to do all the statutes and the ordinances
        which I set before you this day.
012:001 These are the statutes and the ordinances which you shall observe
        to do in the land which Yahweh, the God of your fathers,
        has given you to possess it, all the days that you live
        on the earth.
012:002 You shall surely destroy all the places in which the nations that
        you shall dispossess served their gods, on the high mountains,
        and on the hills, and under every green tree:
012:003 and you shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces
        their pillars, and burn their Asherim with fire;
        and you shall cut down the engraved images of their gods;
        and you shall destroy their name out of that place.
012:004 You shall not do so to Yahweh your God.
012:005 But to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose out of all
        your tribes, to put his name there, even to his habitation
        shall you seek, and there you shall come;
012:006 and there you shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices,
        and your tithes, and the wave offering of your hand,
        and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstborn
        of your herd and of your flock:
012:007 and there you shall eat before Yahweh your God, and you shall
        rejoice in all that you put your hand to, you and your households,
        in which Yahweh your God has blessed you.
012:008 You shall not do after all the things that we do here this day,
        every man whatever is right in his own eyes;
012:009 for you haven't yet come to the rest and to the inheritance,
        which Yahweh your God gives you.
012:010 But when you go over the Jordan, and dwell in the land which
        Yahweh your God causes you to inherit, and he gives you rest
        from all your enemies round about, so that you dwell in safety;
012:011 then it shall happen that to the place which Yahweh your God
        shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there, there shall
        you bring all that I command you:  your burnt offerings,
        and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the wave offering of
        your hand, and all your choice vows which you vow to Yahweh.
012:012 You shall rejoice before Yahweh your God, you, and your sons,
        and your daughters, and your male servants, and your
        female servants, and the Levite who is within your gates,
        because he has no portion nor inheritance with you.
012:013 Take heed to yourself that you don't offer your burnt offerings
        in every place that you see;
012:014 but in the place which Yahweh shall choose in one of your tribes,
        there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you
        shall do all that I command you.
012:015 Notwithstanding, you may kill and eat flesh within all
        your gates, after all the desire of your soul, according to
        the blessing of Yahweh your God which he has given you:
        the unclean and the clean may eat of it, as of the gazelle,
        and as of the hart.
012:016 Only you shall not eat the blood; you shall pour it out on
        the earth as water.
012:017 You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain,
        or of your new wine, or of your oil, or the firstborn of your
        herd or of your flock, nor any of your vows which you vow,
        nor your freewill offerings, nor the wave offering of your hand;
012:018 but you shall eat them before Yahweh your God in the place
        which Yahweh your God shall choose, you, and your son,
        and your daughter, and your male servant, and your
        female servant, and the Levite who is within your gates:
        and you shall rejoice before Yahweh your God in all that you
        put your hand to.
012:019 Take heed to yourself that you don't forsake the Levite as long
        as you live in your land.
012:020 When Yahweh your God shall enlarge your border, as he has
        promised you, and you shall say, I will eat flesh,
        because your soul desires to eat flesh; you may eat flesh,
        after all the desire of your soul.
012:021 If the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to put
        his name there, be too far from you, then you shall kill
        of your herd and of your flock, which Yahweh has given you,
        as I have commanded you; and you may eat within your gates,
        after all the desire of your soul.
012:022 Even as the gazelle and as the hart is eaten, so you shall eat of it:
        the unclean and the clean may eat of it alike.
012:023 Only be sure that you don't eat the blood:  for the blood
        is the life; and you shall not eat the life with the flesh.
012:024 You shall not eat it; you shall pour it out on the earth as water.
012:025 You shall not eat it; that it may go well with you, and with
        your children after you, when you shall do that which is
        right in the eyes of Yahweh.
012:026 Only your holy things which you have, and your vows, you shall take,
        and go to the place which Yahweh shall choose:
012:027 and you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood,
        on the altar of Yahweh your God; and the blood of your
        sacrifices shall be poured out on the altar of Yahweh your God;
        and you shall eat the flesh.
012:028 Observe and hear all these words which I command you, that it
        may go well with you, and with your children after you forever,
        when you do that which is good and right in the eyes of
        Yahweh your God.
012:029 When Yahweh your God shall cut off the nations from before you,
        where you go in to dispossess them, and you dispossess them,
        and dwell in their land;
012:030 take heed to yourself that you not be ensnared to follow them,
        after that they are destroyed from before you; and that you
        not inquire after their gods, saying, How do these nations
        serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.
012:031 You shall not do so to Yahweh your God:  for every abomination
        to Yahweh, which he hates, have they done to their gods;
        for even their sons and their daughters do they burn in the fire
        to their gods.
012:032 Whatever thing I command you, that shall you observe to do:
        you shall not add thereto, nor diminish from it.
013:001 If there arise in the midst of you a prophet, or a dreamer
        of dreams, and he give you a sign or a wonder,
013:002 and the sign or the wonder come to pass, of which he spoke
        to you, saying, Let us go after other gods, which you have
        not known, and let us serve them;
013:003 you shall not listen to the words of that prophet, or to
        that dreamer of dreams:  for Yahweh your God proves you,
        to know whether you love Yahweh your God with all your heart
        and with all your soul.
013:004 You shall walk after Yahweh your God, and fear him, and keep
        his commandments, and obey his voice, and you shall serve him,
        and cleave to him.
013:005 That prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death,
        because he has spoken rebellion against Yahweh your God,
        who brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed
        you out of the house of bondage, to draw you aside out
        of the way which Yahweh your God commanded you to walk in.
        So shall you put away the evil from the midst of you.
013:006 If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son,
        or your daughter, or the wife of your bosom, or your friend,
        who is as your own soul, entice you secretly, saying, Let us
        go and serve other gods, which you have not known, you,
        nor your fathers;
013:007 of the gods of the peoples who are round about you, near to you,
        or far off from you, from the one end of the earth even
        to the other end of the earth;
013:008 you shall not consent to him, nor listen to him; neither shall
        your eye pity him, neither shall you spare, neither shall
        you conceal him:
013:009 but you shall surely kill him; your hand shall be first on him
        to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.
013:010 You shall stone him to death with stones, because he has
        sought to draw you away from Yahweh your God, who brought
        you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
013:011 All Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall not do any more
        such wickedness as this is in the midst of you.
013:012 If you shall hear tell concerning one of your cities,
        which Yahweh your God gives you to dwell there, saying,
013:013 Certain base fellows are gone out from the midst of you,
        and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us
        go and serve other gods, which you have not known;
013:014 then shall you inquire, and make search, and ask diligently;
        and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain,
        that such abomination is done in the midst of you,
013:015 you shall surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge
        of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein
        and the livestock of it, with the edge of the sword.
013:016 You shall gather all the spoil of it into the midst
        of the street of it, and shall burn with fire the city,
        and all the spoil of it every whit, to Yahweh your God:
        and it shall be a heap forever; it shall not be built again.
013:017 There shall cleave nothing of the devoted thing to your hand;
        that Yahweh may turn from the fierceness of his anger,
        and show you mercy, and have compassion on you, and multiply you,
        as he has sworn to your fathers;
013:018 when you shall listen to the voice of Yahweh your God,
        to keep all his commandments which I command you this day,
        to do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh your God.
014:001 You are the children of Yahweh your God:  you shall not
        cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes
        for the dead.
014:002 For you are a holy people to Yahweh your God, and Yahweh
        has chosen you to be a people for his own possession,
        above all peoples who are on the face of the earth.
014:003 You shall not eat any abominable thing.
014:004 These are the animals which you may eat:  the ox, the sheep,
        and the goat,
014:005 the hart, and the gazelle, and the roebuck, and the wild goat,
        and the ibex, and the antelope, and the chamois.
014:006 Every animal that parts the hoof, and has the hoof cloven in two,
        [and] chews the cud, among the animals, that may you eat.
014:007 Nevertheless these you shall not eat of them that chew the cud,
        or of those who have the hoof cloven:  the camel, and the hare,
        and the rabbit; because they chew the cud but don't part the hoof,
        they are unclean to you.
014:008 The pig, because it has a split hoof but doesn't chew the cud,
        is unclean to you:  of their flesh you shall not eat,
        and their carcasses you shall not touch.
014:009 These you may eat of all that are in the waters:
        whatever has fins and scales may you eat;
014:010 and whatever doesn't have fins and scales you shall not eat;
        it is unclean to you.
014:011 Of all clean birds you may eat.
014:012 But these are they of which you shall not eat:  the eagle,
        and the vulture, and the osprey,
014:013 and the red kite, and the falcon, and the kite after its kind,
014:014 and every raven after its kind,
014:015 and the ostrich, and the owl, and the seagull, and the hawk
        after its kind,
014:016 the little owl, and the great owl, and the horned owl,
014:017 and the pelican, and the vulture, and the cormorant,
014:018 and the stork, and the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe,
        and the bat.
014:019 All winged creeping things are unclean to you:  they shall
        not be eaten.
014:020 Of all clean birds you may eat.
014:021 You shall not eat of anything that dies of itself:
        you may give it to the foreigner living among you who is
        within your gates, that he may eat it; or you may sell it
        to a foreigner:  for you are a holy people to Yahweh your God.
        You shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk.
014:022 You shall surely tithe all the increase of your seed,
        that which comes forth from the field year by year.
014:023 You shall eat before Yahweh your God, in the place
        which he shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there,
        the tithe of your grain, of your new wine, and of your oil,
        and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock; that you
        may learn to fear Yahweh your God always.
014:024 If the way be too long for you, so that you are not able
        to carry it, because the place is too far from you,
        which Yahweh your God shall choose, to set his name there,
        when Yahweh your God shall bless you;
014:025 then shall you turn it into money, and bind up the money
        in your hand, and shall go to the place which Yahweh your
        God shall choose:
014:026 and you shall bestow the money for whatever your soul desires,
        for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink,
        or for whatever your soul asks of you; and you shall eat
        there before Yahweh your God, and you shall rejoice,
        you and your household.
014:027 The Levite who is within your gates, you shall not forsake him;
        for he has no portion nor inheritance with you.
014:028 At the end of every three years you shall bring forth all
        the tithe of your increase in the same year, and shall lay
        it up within your gates:
014:029 and the Levite, because he has no portion nor inheritance with you,
        and the foreigner living among you, and the fatherless,
        and the widow, who are within your gates, shall come,
        and shall eat and be satisfied; that Yahweh your God may bless
        you in all the work of your hand which you do.
015:001 At the end of every seven years you shall make a release.
015:002 This is the manner of the release:  every creditor
        shall release that which he has lent to his neighbor;
        he shall not exact it of his neighbor and his brother;
        because Yahweh's release has been proclaimed.
015:003 Of a foreigner you may exact it:  but whatever of your is
        with your brother your hand shall release.
015:004 However there shall be no poor with you; (for Yahweh will
        surely bless you in the land which Yahweh your God gives you
        for an inheritance to possess it;)
015:005 if only you diligently listen to the voice of Yahweh your God,
        to observe to do all this commandment which I command
        you this day.
015:006 For Yahweh your God will bless you, as he promised you:
        and you shall lend to many nations, but you shall not borrow;
        and you shall rule over many nations, but they shall not
        rule over you.
015:007 If there be with you a poor man, one of your brothers,
        within any of your gates in your land which Yahweh your God
        gives you, you shall not harden your heart, nor shut your hand
        from your poor brother;
015:008 but you shall surely open your hand to him, and shall surely
        lend him sufficient for his need [in that] which he wants.
015:009 Beware that there not be a base thought in your heart, saying,
        The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and your eye
        be evil against your poor brother, and you give him nothing;
        and he cry to Yahweh against you, and it be sin to you.
015:010 You shall surely give him, and your heart shall not be grieved
        when you give to him; because that for this thing Yahweh
        your God will bless you in all your work, and in all that you
        put your hand to.
015:011 For the poor will never cease out of the land:
        therefore I command you, saying, You shall surely open
        your hand to your brother, to your needy, and to your poor,
        in your land.
015:012 If your brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, be sold to you,
        and serve you six years; then in the seventh year you shall
        let him go free from you.
015:013 When you let him go free from you, you shall not let him go empty:
015:014 you shall furnish him liberally out of your flock,
        and out of your threshing floor, and out of your winepress;
        as Yahweh your God has blessed you, you shall give to him.
015:015 You shall remember that you were a bondservant in the land
        of Egypt, and Yahweh your God redeemed you:  therefore I
        command you this thing today.
015:016 It shall be, if he tell you, I will not go out from you;
        because he loves you and your house, because he is well with you;
015:017 then you shall take an awl, and thrust it through his ear
        to the door, and he shall be your servant forever.
        Also to your female servant you shall do likewise.
015:018 It shall not seem hard to you, when you let him go free from you;
        for to the double of the hire of a hireling has he served
        you six years:  and Yahweh your God will bless you in all
        that you do.
015:019 All the firstborn males that are born of your herd and
        of your flock you shall sanctify to Yahweh your God:
        you shall do no work with the firstborn of your herd,
        nor shear the firstborn of your flock.
015:020 You shall eat it before Yahweh your God year by year in the place
        which Yahweh shall choose, you and your household.
015:021 If it have any blemish, [as if it be] lame or blind, any ill
        blemish whatever, you shall not sacrifice it to Yahweh your God.
015:022 You shall eat it within your gates:  the unclean and the clean
        [shall eat it] alike, as the gazelle, and as the hart.
015:023 Only you shall not eat its blood; you shall pour it out on
        the ground as water.
016:001 Observe the month of Abib, and keep the Passover to Yahweh your God;
        for in the month of Abib Yahweh your God brought you forth
        out of Egypt by night.
016:002 You shall sacrifice the Passover to Yahweh your God, of the flock
        and the herd, in the place which Yahweh shall choose,
        to cause his name to dwell there.
016:003 You shall eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shall you
        eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction;
        for you came forth out of the land of Egypt in haste:
        that you may remember the day when you came forth out of the land
        of Egypt all the days of your life.
016:004 There shall be no yeast seen with you in all your borders
        seven days; neither shall any of the flesh, which you sacrifice
        the first day at even, remain all night until the morning.
016:005 You may not sacrifice the Passover within any of your gates,
        which Yahweh your God gives you;
016:006 but at the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to cause
        his name to dwell in, there you shall sacrifice the Passover
        at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that you
        came forth out of Egypt.
016:007 You shall roast and eat it in the place which Yahweh your God
        shall choose:  and you shall turn in the morning, and go
        to your tents.
016:008 Six days you shall eat unleavened bread; and on the seventh
        day shall be a solemn assembly to Yahweh your God; you shall
        do no work [therein].
016:009 Seven weeks shall you number to you:  from the time you begin
        to put the sickle to the standing grain shall you begin
        to number seven weeks.
016:010 You shall keep the feast of weeks to Yahweh your God with a tribute
        of a freewill offering of your hand, which you shall give,
        according as Yahweh your God blesses you:
016:011 and you shall rejoice before Yahweh your God, you, and your son,
        and your daughter, and your male servant, and your female servant,
        and the Levite who is within your gates, and the foreigner,
        and the fatherless, and the widow, who are in the midst of you,
        in the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to cause
        his name to dwell there.
016:012 You shall remember that you were a bondservant in Egypt:
        and you shall observe and do these statutes.
016:013 You shall keep the feast of tents seven days, after that you have
        gathered in from your threshing floor and from your winepress:
016:014 and you shall rejoice in your feast, you, and your son,
        and your daughter, and your male servant, and your female servant,
        and the Levite, and the foreigner, and the fatherless,
        and the widow, who are within your gates.
016:015 Seven days shall you keep a feast to Yahweh your God in the place
        which Yahweh shall choose; because Yahweh your God will bless
        you in all your increase, and in all the work of your hands,
        and you shall be altogether joyful.
016:016 Three times in a year shall all your males appear before
        Yahweh your God in the place which he shall choose:
        in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks,
        and in the feast of tents; and they shall not appear
        before Yahweh empty:
016:017 every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing
        of Yahweh your God which he has given you.
016:018 Judges and officers shall you make you in all your gates,
        which Yahweh your God gives you, according to your tribes;
        and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment.
016:019 You shall not wrest justice:  you shall not respect persons;
        neither shall you take a bribe; for a bribe does blind the eyes
        of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.
016:020 That which is altogether just shall you follow, that you may live,
        and inherit the land which Yahweh your God gives you.
016:021 You shall not plant you an Asherah of any kind of tree beside
        the altar of Yahweh your God, which you shall make you.
016:022 Neither shall you set yourself up a pillar; which Yahweh
        your God hates.
017:001 You shall not sacrifice to Yahweh your God an ox, or a sheep,
        in which is a blemish, [or] anything evil; for that is an
        abomination to Yahweh your God.
017:002 If there be found in the midst of you, within any of your
        gates which Yahweh your God gives you, man or woman,
        who does that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh your God,
        in transgressing his covenant,
017:003 and has gone and served other gods, and worshiped them,
        or the sun, or the moon, or any of the army of the sky,
        which I have not commanded;
017:004 and it be told you, and you have heard of it, then shall you
        inquire diligently; and behold, if it be true, and the thing certain,
        that such abomination is done in Israel,
017:005 then shall you bring forth that man or that woman, who has done
        this evil thing, to your gates, even the man or the woman;
        and you shall stone them to death with stones.
017:006 At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he who is
        to die be put to death; at the mouth of one witness he shall
        not be put to death.
017:007 The hand of the witnesses shall be first on him to put
        him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people.
        So you shall put away the evil from the midst of you.
017:008 If there arise a matter too hard for you in judgment,
        between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke
        and stroke, being matters of controversy within your gates;
        then shall you arise, and go up to the place which Yahweh
        your God shall choose;
017:009 and you shall come to the priests the Levites, and to the judge
        who shall be in those days:  and you shall inquire;
        and they shall show you the sentence of judgment.
017:010 You shall do according to the tenor of the sentence which they
        shall show you from that place which Yahweh shall choose;
        and you shall observe to do according to all that they
        shall teach you:
017:011 according to the tenor of the law which they shall teach you,
        and according to the judgment which they shall tell you,
        you shall do; you shall not turn aside from the sentence
        which they shall show you, to the right hand, nor to the left.
017:012 The man who does presumptuously, in not listening to the priest
        who stands to minister there before Yahweh your God,
        or to the judge, even that man shall die:  and you shall put
        away the evil from Israel.
017:013 All the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously.
017:014 When you are come to the land which Yahweh your God gives you,
        and shall possess it, and shall dwell therein, and shall say,
        I will set a king over me, like all the nations that are
        round about me;
017:015 you shall surely set him king over you, whom Yahweh your
        God shall choose:  one from among your brothers shall you
        set king over you; you may not put a foreigner over you,
        who is not your brother.
017:016 Only he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people
        to return to Egypt, to the end that he may multiply horses;
        because Yahweh has said to you, You shall henceforth return
        no more that way.
017:017 Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart
        not turn away:  neither shall he greatly multiply to himself
        silver and gold.
017:018 It shall be, when he sits on the throne of his kingdom,
        that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book,
        out of [that which is] before the priests the Levites:
017:019 and it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days
        of his life; that he may learn to fear Yahweh his God,
        to keep all the words of this law and these statutes,
        to do them;
017:020 that his heart not be lifted up above his brothers, and that he not
        turn aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left:
        to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom,
        he and his children, in the midst of Israel.
018:001 The priests the Levites, [even] all the tribe of Levi,
        shall have no portion nor inheritance with Israel:
        they shall eat the offerings of Yahweh made by fire,
        and his inheritance.
018:002 They shall have no inheritance among their brothers:
        Yahweh is their inheritance, as he has spoken to them.
018:003 This shall be the priests' due from the people, from those
        who offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep, that they
        shall give to the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks,
        and the maw.
018:004 The first fruits of your grain, of your new wine, and of your oil,
        and the first of the fleece of your sheep, shall you give him.
018:005 For Yahweh your God has chosen him out of all your tribes,
        to stand to minister in the name of Yahweh, him and his
        sons for ever.
018:006 If a Levite comes from any of your gates out of all Israel,
        where he lives as a foreigner, and comes with all the desire
        of his soul to the place which Yahweh shall choose;
018:007 then he shall minister in the name of Yahweh his God, as all
        his brothers the Levites do, who stand there before Yahweh.
018:008 They shall have like portions to eat, besides that which comes
        of the sale of his patrimony.
018:009 When you are come into the land which Yahweh your God gives you,
        you shall not learn to do after the abominations of those nations.
018:010 There shall not be found with you anyone who makes his son or his
        daughter to pass through the fire, one who uses divination,
        one who practices sorcery, or an enchanter, or a sorcerer,
018:011 or a charmer, or a consulter with a familiar spirit, or a wizard,
        or a necromancer.
018:012 For whoever does these things is an abomination to Yahweh:
        and because of these abominations Yahweh your God does drive
        them out from before you.
018:013 You shall be perfect with Yahweh your God.
018:014 For these nations, that you shall dispossess, listen to those
        who practice sorcery, and to diviners; but as for you,
        Yahweh your God has not allowed you so to do.
018:015 Yahweh your God will raise up to you a prophet from the midst
        of you, of your brothers, like me; to him you shall listen;
018:016 according to all that you desired of Yahweh your God in Horeb
        in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again
        the voice of Yahweh my God, neither let me see this great fire
        any more, that I not die.
018:017 Yahweh said to me, They have well said that which they have spoken.
018:018 I will raise them up a prophet from among their brothers,
        like you; and I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall
        speak to them all that I shall command him.
018:019 It shall happen, that whoever will not listen to my words
        which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.
018:020 But the prophet, who shall speak a word presumptuously in my name,
        which I have not commanded him to speak, or who shall speak
        in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die.
018:021 If you say in your heart, How shall we know the word which Yahweh
        has not spoken?
018:022 when a prophet speaks in the name of Yahweh, if the thing
        doesn't follow, nor happen, that is the thing which Yahweh
        has not spoken:  the prophet has spoken it presumptuously,
        you shall not be afraid of him.
019:001 When Yahweh your God shall cut off the nations, whose land
        Yahweh your God gives you, and you succeed them, and dwell
        in their cities, and in their houses;
019:002 you shall set apart three cities for you in the midst of your land,
        which Yahweh your God gives you to possess it.
019:003 You shall prepare you the way, and divide the borders of your land,
        which Yahweh your God causes you to inherit, into three parts,
        that every manslayer may flee there.
019:004 This is the case of the manslayer, that shall flee there and live:
        whoever kills his neighbor unawares, and didn't hate him
        in time past;
019:005 as when a man goes into the forest with his neighbor to hew wood,
        and his hand fetches a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree,
        and the head slips from the handle, and lights on his neighbor,
        so that he dies; he shall flee to one of these cities and live:
019:006 lest the avenger of blood pursue the manslayer, while his
        heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long,
        and strike him mortally; whereas he was not worthy of death,
        inasmuch as he didn't hate him in time past.
019:007 Therefore I command you, saying, You shall set apart three
        cities for you.
019:008 If Yahweh your God enlarge your border, as he has sworn
        to your fathers, and give you all the land which he promised
        to give to your fathers;
019:009 if you shall keep all this commandment to do it, which I command
        you this day, to love Yahweh your God, and to walk ever
        in his ways; then shall you add three cities more for you,
        besides these three:
019:010 that innocent blood not be shed in the midst of your land,
        which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance,
        and so blood be on you.
019:011 But if any man hate his neighbor, and lie in wait for him,
        and rise up against him, and strike him mortally so that he dies,
        and he flee into one of these cities;
019:012 then the elders of his city shall send and bring him there,
        and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood,
        that he may die.
019:013 Your eye shall not pity him, but you shall put away the innocent
        blood from Israel, that it may go well with you.
019:014 You shall not remove your neighbor's landmark, which they of old
        time have set, in your inheritance which you shall inherit,
        in the land that Yahweh your God gives you to possess it.
019:015 One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity,
        or for any sin, in any sin that he sins:  at the mouth
        of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses,
        shall a matter be established.
019:016 If an unrighteous witness rise up against any man to testify
        against him of wrong-doing,
019:017 then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand
        before Yahweh, before the priests and the judges who shall
        be in those days;
019:018 and the judges shall make diligent inquisition:  and, behold,
        if the witness is a false witness, and has testified falsely
        against his brother;
019:019 then shall you do to him, as he had thought to do to his brother:
        so shall you put away the evil from the midst of you.
019:020 Those who remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth
        commit no more any such evil in the midst of you.
019:021 Your eyes shall not pity; life [shall go] for life, eye for eye,
        tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
020:001 When you go forth to battle against your enemies, and see horses,
        and chariots, [and] a people more than you, you shall
        not be afraid of them; for Yahweh your God is with you,
        who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.
020:002 It shall be, when you draw near to the battle, that the priest
        shall approach and speak to the people,
020:003 and shall tell them, Hear, Israel, you draw near this day
        to battle against your enemies:  don't let your heart faint;
        don't be afraid, nor tremble, neither be scared of them;
020:004 for Yahweh your God is he who goes with you, to fight for you
        against your enemies, to save you.
020:005 The officers shall speak to the people, saying, What man is
        there who has built a new house, and has not dedicated it? let
        him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle,
        and another man dedicate it.
020:006 What man is there who has planted a vineyard, and has not
        used the fruit of it? let him go and return to his house,
        lest he die in the battle, and another man use the fruit of it.
020:007 What man is there who has pledged to be married a wife,
        and has not taken her? let him go and return to his house,
        lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.
020:008 The officers shall speak further to the people, and they shall say,
        What man is there who is fearful and faint-hearted? let him
        go and return to his house, lest his brother's heart melt
        as his heart.
020:009 It shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking
        to the people, that they shall appoint captains of armies
        at the head of the people.
020:010 When you draw near to a city to fight against it, then proclaim
        peace to it.
020:011 It shall be, if it make you answer of peace, and open to you,
        then it shall be, that all the people who are found therein
        shall become tributary to you, and shall serve you.
020:012 If it will make no peace with you, but will make war against you,
        then you shall besiege it:
020:013 and when Yahweh your God delivers it into your hand, you shall
        strike every male of it with the edge of the sword:
020:014 but the women, and the little ones, and the livestock,
        and all that is in the city, even all the spoil of it,
        shall you take for a prey to yourself; and you shall eat
        the spoil of your enemies, which Yahweh your God has given you.
020:015 Thus shall you do to all the cities which are very far off
        from you, which are not of the cities of these nations.
020:016 But of the cities of these peoples, that Yahweh your God gives you
        for an inheritance, you shall save alive nothing that breathes;
020:017 but you shall utterly destroy them:  the Hittite, and the Amorite,
        the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite;
        as Yahweh your God has commanded you;
020:018 that they not teach you to do after all their abominations,
        which they have done to their gods; so would you sin against
        Yahweh your God.
020:019 When you shall besiege a city a long time, in making war
        against it to take it, you shall not destroy the trees of it
        by wielding an axe against them; for you may eat of them,
        and you shall not cut them down; for is the tree of the field man,
        that it should be besieged of you?
020:020 Only the trees of which you know that they are not trees
        for food, you shall destroy and cut them down; and you shall
        build bulwarks against the city that makes war with you,
        until it fall.
021:001 If one be found slain in the land which Yahweh your God gives
        you to possess it, lying in the field, and it isn't known
        who has struck him;
021:002 then your elders and your judges shall come forth, and they shall
        measure to the cities which are round about him who is slain:
021:003 and it shall be, that the city which is nearest to the slain man,
        even the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd,
        which hasn't been worked with, and which has not drawn
        in the yoke;
021:004 and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer to a
        valley with running water, which is neither plowed nor sown,
        and shall break the heifer's neck there in the valley.
021:005 The priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them Yahweh
        your God has chosen to minister to him, and to bless in the name
        of Yahweh; and according to their word shall every controversy
        and every stroke be.
021:006 All the elders of that city, who are nearest to the slain man,
        shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken
        in the valley;
021:007 and they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood,
        neither have our eyes seen it.
021:008 Forgive, Yahweh, your people Israel, whom you have redeemed,
        and don't allow innocent blood [to remain] in the midst
        of your people Israel.  The blood shall be forgiven them.
021:009 So shall you put away the innocent blood from the midst of you,
        when you shall do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh.
021:010 When you go forth to battle against your enemies, and Yahweh
        your God delivers them into your hands, and you carry
        them away captive,
021:011 and see among the captives a beautiful woman, and you have
        a desire to her, and would take her to you as wife;
021:012 then you shall bring her home to your house; and she shall
        shave her head, and pare her nails;
021:013 and she shall put the clothing of her captivity from off her,
        and shall remain in your house, and bewail her father and her
        mother a full month:  and after that you shall go in to her,
        and be her husband, and she shall be your wife.
021:014 It shall be, if you have no delight in her, then you shall
        let her go where she will; but you shall not sell her at
        all for money, you shall not deal with her as a slave,
        because you have humbled her.
021:015 If a man have two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated,
        and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated;
        and if the firstborn son be hers who was hated;
021:016 then it shall be, in the day that he causes his sons
        to inherit that which he has, that he may not make the son
        of the beloved the firstborn before the son of the hated,
        who is the firstborn:
021:017 but he shall acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the hated,
        by giving him a double portion of all that he has; for he is
        the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his.
021:018 If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, who will not obey
        the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and,
        though they chasten him, will not listen to them;
021:019 then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him,
        and bring him out to the elders of his city, and to the gate
        of his place;
021:020 and they shall tell the elders of his city, This our son
        is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice;
        he is a glutton, and a drunkard.
021:021 All the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones:
        so shall you put away the evil from the midst of you;
        and all Israel shall hear, and fear.
021:022 If a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be put
        to death, and you hang him on a tree;
021:023 his body shall not remain all night on the tree, but you shall
        surely bury him the same day; for he who is hanged is accursed
        of God; that you don't defile your land which Yahweh your God
        gives you for an inheritance.
022:001 You shall not see your brother's ox or his sheep go astray,
        and hide yourself from them:  you shall surely bring them
        again to your brother.
022:002 If your brother isn't near to you, or if you don't know him,
        then you shall bring it home to your house, and it shall
        be with you until your brother seek after it, and you shall
        restore it to him.
022:003 So shall you do with his donkey; and so shall you do with
        his garment; and so shall you do with every lost thing
        of your brother's, which he has lost, and you have found:
        you may not hide yourself.
022:004 You shall not see your brother's donkey or his ox
        fallen down by the way, and hide yourself from them:
        you shall surely help him to lift them up again.
022:005 A woman shall not wear men's clothing, neither shall a man
        put on women's clothing; for whoever does these things is
        an abomination to Yahweh your God.
022:006 If a bird's nest chance to be before you in the way,
        in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs,
        and the hen sitting on the young, or on the eggs, you shall
        not take the hen with the young:
022:007 you shall surely let the hen go, but the young you may take
        to yourself; that it may be well with you, and that you may
        prolong your days.
022:008 When you build a new house, then you shall make a battlement
        for your roof, that you don't bring blood on your house,
        if any man fall from there.
022:009 You shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed,
        lest the whole fruit be forfeited, the seed which you have sown,
        and the increase of the vineyard.
022:010 You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together.
022:011 You shall not wear a mixed stuff, wool and linen together.
022:012 You shall make yourselves fringes{or, tassles} on the four
        borders of your cloak, with which you cover yourself.
022:013 If any man takes a wife, and goes in to her, and hates her,
022:014 and accuses her of shameful things, and brings up an evil name
        on her, and says, I took this woman, and when I came near to her,
        I didn't find in her the tokens of virginity;
022:015 then shall the father of the young lady, and her mother,
        take and bring forth the tokens of the young lady's virginity
        to the elders of the city in the gate;
022:016 and the young lady's father shall tell the elders, I gave
        my daughter to this man to wife, and he hates her;
022:017 and behold, he has laid shameful things [to her charge], saying,
        I didn't find in your daughter the tokens of virginity;
        and yet these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity.
        They shall spread the garment before the elders of the city.
022:018 The elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him;
022:019 and they shall fine him one hundred [shekels] of silver,
        and give them to the father of the young lady, because he has
        brought up an evil name on a virgin of Israel:  and she shall
        be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.
022:020 But if this thing be true, that the tokens of virginity were
        not found in the young lady;
022:021 then they shall bring out the young lady to the door
        of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone
        her to death with stones, because she has done folly
        in Israel, to play the prostitute in her father's house:
        so shall you put away the evil from the midst of you.
022:022 If a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband,
        then they shall both of them die, the man who lay with the woman,
        and the woman:  so shall you put away the evil from Israel.
022:023 If there be a young lady who is a virgin pledged to be married
        to a husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her;
022:024 then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city,
        and you shall stone them to death with stones;
        the lady, because she didn't cry, being in the city;
        and the man, because he has humbled his neighbor's wife:
        so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you.
022:025 But if the man find the lady who is pledged to be married
        in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her;
        then the man only who lay with her shall die:
022:026 but to the lady you shall do nothing; there is in the lady no sin
        worthy of death:  for as when a man rises against his neighbor,
        and kills him, even so is this matter;
022:027 for he found her in the field, the pledged to be married
        lady cried, and there was none to save her.
022:028 If a man find a lady who is a virgin, who is not pledged
        to be married, and lay hold on her, and lie with her,
        and they be found;
022:029 then the man who lay with her shall give to the lady's father
        fifty [shekels] of silver, and she shall be his wife,
        because he has humbled her; he may not put her away all his days.
022:030 A man shall not take his father's wife, and shall not uncover
        his father's skirt.
023:001 He who is wounded in the stones, or has his privy member cut off,
        shall not enter into the assembly of Yahweh.
023:002 A bastard shall not enter into the assembly of Yahweh;
        even to the tenth generation shall none of his enter into
        the assembly of Yahweh.
023:003 An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly
        of Yahweh; even to the tenth generation shall none belonging
        to them enter into the assembly of Yahweh forever:
023:004 because they didn't meet you with bread and with water in the way,
        when you came forth out of Egypt, and because they hired
        against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia,
        to curse you.
023:005 Nevertheless Yahweh your God wouldn't listen to Balaam;
        but Yahweh your God turned the curse into a blessing to you,
        because Yahweh your God loved you.
023:006 You shall not seek their peace nor their prosperity all
        your days forever.
023:007 You shall not abhor an Edomite; for he is your brother:
        you shall not abhor an Egyptian, because you lived as a foreigner
        in his land.
023:008 The children of the third generation who are born to them
        shall enter into the assembly of Yahweh.
023:009 When you go forth in camp against your enemies, then you shall
        keep you from every evil thing.
023:010 If there be among you any man, who is not clean by reason
        of that which happens him by night, then shall he go abroad
        out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp:
023:011 but it shall be, when evening comes on, he shall bathe
        himself in water; and when the sun is down, he shall come
        within the camp.
023:012 You shall have a place also outside of the camp, where you
        shall go forth abroad:
023:013 and you shall have a paddle among your weapons; and it shall be,
        when you sit down abroad, you shall dig therewith, and shall
        turn back and cover that which comes from you:
023:014 for Yahweh your God walks in the midst of your camp,
        to deliver you, and to give up your enemies before you;
        therefore shall your camp be holy, that he may not see
        an unclean thing in you, and turn away from you.
023:015 You shall not deliver to his master a servant who is escaped
        from his master to you:
023:016 he shall dwell with you, in the midst of you, in the place which
        he shall choose within one of your gates, where it pleases him best:
        you shall not oppress him.
023:017 There shall be no prostitute of the daughters of Israel,
        neither shall there be a sodomite of the sons of Israel.
023:018 You shall not bring the hire of a prostitute, or the wages
        of a dog, into the house of Yahweh your God for any vow:
        for even both these are an abomination to Yahweh your God.
023:019 You shall not lend on interest to your brother; interest of money,
        interest of food, interest of anything that is lent on interest:
023:020 to a foreigner you may lend on interest; but to your brother
        you shall not lend on interest, that Yahweh your God may bless
        you in all that you put your hand to, in the land where you
        go in to possess it.
023:021 When you shall vow a vow to Yahweh your God, you shall not be slack
        to pay it:  for Yahweh your God will surely require it of you;
        and it would be sin in you.
023:022 But if you shall forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in you.
023:023 That which is gone out of your lips you shall observe and do;
        according as you have vowed to Yahweh your God, a freewill offering,
        which you have promised with your mouth.
023:024 When you come into your neighbor's vineyard, then you may eat
        of grapes your fill at your own pleasure; but you shall not
        put any in your vessel.
023:025 When you come into your neighbor's standing grain, then you
        may pluck the ears with your hand; but you shall not move
        a sickle to your neighbor's standing grain.
024:001 When a man takes a wife, and marries her, then it shall be,
        if she find no favor in his eyes, because he has found some
        unseemly thing in her, that he shall write her a bill of divorce,
        and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.
024:002 When she is departed out of his house, she may go and be
        another man's [wife].
024:003 If the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorce,
        and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house;
        or if the latter husband die, who took her to be his wife;
024:004 her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again
        to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination
        before Yahweh:  and you shall not cause the land to sin,
        which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance.
024:005 When a man takes a new wife, he shall not go out in the army,
        neither shall he be charged with any business:
        he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer his wife
        whom he has taken.
024:006 No man shall take the mill or the upper millstone to pledge;
        for he takes [a man's] life to pledge.
024:007 If a man be found stealing any of his brothers of the children
        of Israel, and he deal with him as a slave, or sell him;
        then that thief shall die:  so shall you put away the evil
        from the midst of you.
024:008 Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that you observe diligently,
        and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall
        teach you:  as I commanded them, so you shall observe to do.
024:009 Remember what Yahweh your God did to Miriam, by the way as you
        came forth out of Egypt.
024:010 When you do lend your neighbor any manner of loan, you shall
        not go into his house to get his pledge.
024:011 You shall stand outside, and the man to whom you do lend shall
        bring forth the pledge outside to you.
024:012 If he be a poor man, you shall not sleep with his pledge;
024:013 you shall surely restore to him the pledge when the sun
        goes down, that he may sleep in his garment, and bless you:
        and it shall be righteousness to you before Yahweh your God.
024:014 You shall not oppress a hired servant who is poor and needy,
        whether he be of your brothers, or of your foreigners who are
        in your land within your gates:
024:015 in his day you shall give him his hire, neither shall the sun
        go down on it; for he is poor, and sets his heart on it:
        lest he cry against you to Yahweh, and it be sin to you.
024:016 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children,
        neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers:
        every man shall be put to death for his own sin.
024:017 You shall not wrest the justice [due] to the foreigner,
        [or] to the fatherless, nor take the widow's clothing to pledge;
024:018 but you shall remember that you were a bondservant in Egypt,
        and Yahweh your God redeemed you there:  therefore I command
        you to do this thing.
024:019 When you reap your harvest in your field, and have forgot
        a sheaf in the field, you shall not go again to get it:
        it shall be for the foreigner, for the fatherless, and for
        the widow; that Yahweh your God may bless you in all the work
        of your hands.
024:020 When you beat your olive tree, you shall not go over the
        boughs again:  it shall be for the foreigner, for the fatherless,
        and for the widow.
024:021 When you gather [the grapes of] your vineyard, you shall
        not glean it after you:  it shall be for the foreigner,
        for the fatherless, and for the widow.
024:022 You shall remember that you were a bondservant in the land of Egypt:
        therefore I command you to do this thing.
025:001 If there be a controversy between men, and they come to judgment,
        and [the judges] judge them; then they shall justify the righteous,
        and condemn the wicked;
025:002 and it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten,
        that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten
        before his face, according to his wickedness, by number.
025:003 Forty stripes he may give him, he shall not exceed; lest, if he
        should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes,
        then your brother should seem vile to you.
025:004 You shall not muzzle the ox when he treads out [the grain].
025:005 If brothers dwell together, and one of them die, and have no son,
        the wife of the dead shall not be married outside to a stranger:
        her husband's brother shall go in to her, and take her to him
        as wife, and perform the duty of a husband's brother to her.
025:006 It shall be, that the firstborn whom she bears shall succeed
        in the name of his brother who is dead, that his name not be
        blotted out of Israel.
025:007 If the man doesn't want to take his brother's wife, then his
        brother's wife shall go up to the gate to the elders, and say,
        My husband's brother refuses to raise up to his brother
        a name in Israel; he will not perform the duty of a husband's
        brother to me.
025:008 Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak to him:
        and if he stand, and say, I don't want to take her;
025:009 then his brother's wife shall come to him in the presence
        of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit
        in his face; and she shall answer and say, So shall it be done
        to the man who does not build up his brother's house.
025:010 His name shall be called in Israel, The house of him who has
        his shoe untied.
025:011 When men strive together one with another, and the wife
        of the one draws near to deliver her husband out of the hand
        of him who strikes him, and puts forth her hand, and takes
        him by the secrets;
025:012 then you shall cut off her hand, your eye shall have no pity.
025:013 You shall not have in your bag diverse weights, a great
        and a small.
025:014 You shall not have in your house diverse measures, a great
        and a small.
025:015 A perfect and just weight shall you have; a perfect and just
        measure shall you have:  that your days may be long in the land
        which Yahweh your God gives you.
025:016 For all who do such things, [even] all who do unrighteously,
        are an abomination to Yahweh your God.
025:017 Remember what Amalek did to you by the way as you came forth
        out of Egypt;
025:018 how he met you by the way, and struck the hindmost of you,
        all who were feeble behind you, when you were faint and weary;
        and he didn't fear God.
025:019 Therefore it shall be, when Yahweh your God has given you
        rest from all your enemies round about, in the land which
        Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance to possess it,
        that you shall blot out the memory of Amalek from under the sky;
        you shall not forget.
026:001 It shall be, when you are come in to the land which Yahweh
        your God gives you for an inheritance, and possess it,
        and dwell therein,
026:002 that you shall take of the first of all the fruit of the ground,
        which you shall bring in from your land that Yahweh your God
        gives you; and you shall put it in a basket, and shall go
        to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to cause
        his name to dwell there.
026:003 You shall come to the priest who shall be in those days,
        and tell him, I profess this day to Yahweh your God,
        that I am come to the land which Yahweh swore to our fathers
        to give us.
026:004 The priest shall take the basket out of your hand, and set it
        down before the altar of Yahweh your God.
026:005 You shall answer and say before Yahweh your God, A Syrian
        ready to perish was my father; and he went down into Egypt,
        and sojourned there, few in number; and he became there
        a nation, great, mighty, and populous.
026:006 The Egyptians dealt ill with us, and afflicted us, and laid
        on us hard bondage:
026:007 and we cried to Yahweh, the God of our fathers, and Yahweh
        heard our voice, and saw our affliction, and our toil,
        and our oppression;
026:008 and Yahweh brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand,
        and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror,
        and with signs, and with wonders;
026:009 and he has brought us into this place, and has given us this land,
        a land flowing with milk and honey.
026:010 Now, behold, I have brought the first of the fruit of the ground,
        which you, Yahweh, have given me.  You shall set it down
        before Yahweh your God, and worship before Yahweh your God.
026:011 You shall rejoice in all the good which Yahweh your God
        has given to you, and to your house, you, and the Levite,
        and the foreigner who is in the midst of you.
026:012 When you have made an end of tithing all the tithe of your
        increase in the third year, which is the year of tithing,
        then you shall give it to the Levite, to the foreigner,
        to the fatherless, and to the widow, that they may eat within
        your gates, and be filled.
026:013 You shall say before Yahweh your God, I have put away the holy
        things out of my house, and also have given them to the Levite,
        and to the foreigner, to the fatherless, and to the widow,
        according to all your commandment which you have commanded me:
        I have not transgressed any of your commandments, neither have
        I forgotten them:
026:014 I have not eaten of it in my mourning, neither have I put
        away of it, being unclean, nor given of it for the dead:
        I have listened to the voice of Yahweh my God; I have done
        according to all that you have commanded me.
026:015 Look down from your holy habitation, from heaven, and bless
        your people Israel, and the ground which you have given us,
        as you swore to our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey.
026:016 This day Yahweh your God commands you to do these statutes
        and ordinances:  you shall therefore keep and do them with all
        your heart, and with all your soul.
026:017 You have declared Yahweh this day to be your God, and that you would
        walk in his ways, and keep his statutes, and his commandments,
        and his ordinances, and listen to his voice:
026:018 and Yahweh has declared you this day to be a people for his
        own possession, as he has promised you, and that you should
        keep all his commandments;
026:019 and to make you high above all nations that he has made,
        in praise, and in name, and in honor; and that you may be
        a holy people to Yahweh your God, as he has spoken.
027:001 Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying,
        Keep all the commandment which I command you this day.
027:002 It shall be on the day when you shall pass over the Jordan
        to the land which Yahweh your God gives you, that you shall
        set yourself up great stones, and plaster them with plaster:
027:003 and you shall write on them all the words of this law, when you
        are passed over; that you may go in to the land which Yahweh
        your God gives you, a land flowing with milk and honey,
        as Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has promised you.
027:004 It shall be, when you are passed over the Jordan, that you
        shall set up these stones, which I command you this day,
        in Mount Ebal, and you shall plaster them with plaster.
027:005 There shall you build an altar to Yahweh your God, an altar
        of stones:  you shall lift up no iron [tool] on them.
027:006 You shall build the altar of Yahweh your God of uncut stones;
        and you shall offer burnt offerings thereon to Yahweh your God:
027:007 and you shall sacrifice peace offerings, and shall eat there;
        and you shall rejoice before Yahweh your God.
027:008 You shall write on the stones all the words of this
        law very plainly.
027:009 Moses and the priests the Levites spoke to all Israel, saying,
        Keep silence, and listen, Israel:  this day you are become
        the people of Yahweh your God.
027:010 You shall therefore obey the voice of Yahweh your God,
        and do his commandments and his statutes, which I command
        you this day.
027:011 Moses charged the people the same day, saying,
027:012 These shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people,
        when you are passed over the Jordan:  Simeon, and Levi,
        and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin.
027:013 These shall stand on Mount Ebal for the curse:  Reuben, Gad,
        and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.
027:014 The Levites shall answer, and tell all the men of Israel
        with a loud voice,
027:015 Cursed be the man who makes an engraved or molten image,
        an abomination to Yahweh, the work of the hands of the craftsman,
        and sets it up in secret.  All the people shall answer
        and say, Amen.
027:016 Cursed be he who sets light by his father or his mother.
        All the people shall say, Amen.
027:017 Cursed be he who removes his neighbor's landmark.
        All the people shall say, Amen.
027:018 Cursed be he who makes the blind to wander out of the way.
        All the people shall say, Amen.
027:019 Cursed be he who wrests the justice [due] to the foreigner,
        fatherless, and widow.  All the people shall say, Amen.
027:020 Cursed be he who lies with his father's wife, because he has
        uncovered his father's skirt.  All the people shall say, Amen.
027:021 Cursed be he who lies with any manner of animal.
        All the people shall say, Amen.
027:022 Cursed be he who lies with his sister, the daughter of his father,
        or the daughter of his mother.  All the people shall say, Amen.
027:023 Cursed be he who lies with his mother-in-law. All the people
        shall say, Amen.
027:024 Cursed be he who strikes his neighbor in secret.
        All the people shall say, Amen.
027:025 Cursed be he who takes a bribe to kill an innocent person.
        All the people shall say, Amen.
027:026 Cursed be he who doesn't confirm the words of this law to do them.
        All the people shall say, Amen.
028:001 It shall happen, if you shall listen diligently to the voice
        of Yahweh your God, to observe to do all his commandments
        which I command you this day, that Yahweh your God will set
        you on high above all the nations of the earth:
028:002 and all these blessings shall come on you, and overtake you,
        if you shall listen to the voice of Yahweh your God.
028:003 Blessed shall you be in the city, and blessed shall you be
        in the field.
028:004 Blessed shall be the fruit of your body, and the fruit of your ground,
        and the fruit of your animals, the increase of your livestock,
        and the young of your flock.
028:005 Blessed shall be your basket and your kneading trough.
028:006 Blessed shall you be when you come in, and blessed shall you
        be when you go out.
028:007 Yahweh will cause your enemies who rise up against you to be
        struck before you:  they shall come out against you one way,
        and shall flee before you seven ways.
028:008 Yahweh will command the blessing on you in your barns,
        and in all that you put your hand to; and he will bless you
        in the land which Yahweh your God gives you.
028:009 Yahweh will establish you for a holy people to himself,
        as he has sworn to you; if you shall keep the commandments
        of Yahweh your God, and walk in his ways.
028:010 All the peoples of the earth shall see that you are called
        by the name of Yahweh; and they shall be afraid of you.
028:011 Yahweh will make you plenteous for good, in the fruit of your body,
        and in the fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of your ground,
        in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give you.
028:012 Yahweh will open to you his good treasure in the sky,
        to give the rain of your land in its season, and to bless all
        the work of your hand:  and you shall lend to many nations,
        and you shall not borrow.
028:013 Yahweh will make you the head, and not the tail;
        and you shall be above only, and you shall not be beneath;
        if you shall listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God,
        which I command you this day, to observe and to do [them],
028:014 and shall not turn aside from any of the words which I
        command you this day, to the right hand, or to the left,
        to go after other gods to serve them.
028:015 But it shall come to pass, if you will not listen to the voice
        of Yahweh your God, to observe to do all his commandments
        and his statutes which I command you this day, that all
        these curses shall come on you, and overtake you.
028:016 Cursed shall you be in the city, and cursed shall you be
        in the field.
028:017 Cursed shall be your basket and your kneading trough.
028:018 Cursed shall be the fruit of your body, and the fruit of your ground,
        the increase of your livestock, and the young of your flock.
028:019 Cursed shall you be when you come in, and cursed shall you
        be when you go out.
028:020 Yahweh will send on you cursing, confusion, and rebuke,
        in all that you put your hand to do, until you are destroyed,
        and until you perish quickly; because of the evil of your doings,
        by which you have forsaken me.
028:021 Yahweh will make the pestilence cleave to you, until he has
        consumed you from off the land, where you go in to possess it.
028:022 Yahweh will strike you with consumption, and with fever,
        and with inflammation, and with fiery heat, and with the sword,
        and with blight, and with mildew; and they shall pursue you
        until you perish.
028:023 Your sky that is over your head shall be brass, and the earth
        that is under you shall be iron.
028:024 Yahweh will make the rain of your land powder and dust:
        from the sky shall it come down on you, until you are destroyed.
028:025 Yahweh will cause you to be struck before your enemies;
        you shall go out one way against them, and shall flee seven
        ways before them:  and you shall be tossed back and forth
        among all the kingdoms of the earth.
028:026 Your dead body shall be food to all birds of the sky,
        and to the animals of the earth; and there shall be none
        to frighten them away.
028:027 Yahweh will strike you with the boil of Egypt, and with the tumors,
        and with the scurvy, and with the itch, of which you can
        not be healed.
028:028 Yahweh will strike you with madness, and with blindness,
        and with astonishment of heart;
028:029 and you shall grope at noonday, as the blind gropes
        in darkness, and you shall not prosper in your ways:
        and you shall be only oppressed and robbed always, and there
        shall be none to save you.
028:030 You shall betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her:
        you shall build a house, and you shall not dwell therein:
        you shall plant a vineyard, and shall not use the fruit of it.
028:031 Your ox shall be slain before your eyes, and you shall
        not eat of it:  your donkey shall be violently taken away
        from before your face, and shall not be restored to you:
        your sheep shall be given to your enemies, and you shall
        have none to save you.
028:032 Your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people;
        and your eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all
        the day:  and there shall be nothing in the power of your hand.
028:033 The fruit of your ground, and all your labors, shall a nation
        which you don't know eat up; and you shall be only oppressed
        and crushed always;
028:034 so that you shall be mad for the sight of your eyes which
        you shall see.
028:035 Yahweh will strike you in the knees, and in the legs,
        with a sore boil, of which you can not be healed, from the sole
        of your foot to the crown of your head.
028:036 Yahweh will bring you, and your king whom you shall set over you,
        to a nation that you have not known, you nor your fathers;
        and there shall you serve other gods, wood and stone.
028:037 You shall become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword,
        among all the peoples where Yahweh shall lead you away.
028:038 You shall carry much seed out into the field, and shall gather
        little in; for the locust shall consume it.
028:039 You shall plant vineyards and dress them, but you shall
        neither drink of the wine, nor gather [the grapes];
        for the worm shall eat them.
028:040 You shall have olive trees throughout all your borders,
        but you shall not anoint yourself with the oil; for your olive
        shall cast [its fruit].
028:041 You shall father sons and daughters, but they shall not be yours;
        for they shall go into captivity.
028:042 All your trees and the fruit of your ground shall the locust possess.
028:043 The foreigner who is in the midst of you shall mount up above
        you higher and higher; and you shall come down lower and lower.
028:044 He shall lend to you, and you shall not lend to him:
        he shall be the head, and you shall be the tail.
028:045 All these curses shall come on you, and shall pursue you,
        and overtake you, until you are destroyed; because you didn't
        listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, to keep his commandments
        and his statutes which he commanded you:
028:046 and they shall be on you for a sign and for a wonder,
        and on your seed forever.
028:047 Because you didn't serve Yahweh your God with joyfulness,
        and with gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance
        of all things;
028:048 therefore shall you serve your enemies whom Yahweh shall send
        against you, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness,
        and in want of all things:  and he shall put a yoke of iron
        on your neck, until he have destroyed you.
028:049 Yahweh will bring a nation against you from far, from the end
        of the earth, as the eagle flies; a nation whose language
        you shall not understand;
028:050 a nation of fierce facial expressions, that shall not regard
        the person of the old, nor show favor to the young,
028:051 and shall eat the fruit of your livestock, and the fruit of
        your ground, until you are destroyed; that also shall not leave
        you grain, new wine, or oil, the increase of your livestock,
        or the young of your flock, until they have caused you to perish.
028:052 They shall besiege you in all your gates, until your high
        and fortified walls come down, in which you trusted,
        throughout all your land; and they shall besiege you in all
        your gates throughout all your land, which Yahweh your God
        has given you.
028:053 You shall eat the fruit of your own body, the flesh of your sons
        and of your daughters, whom Yahweh your God has given you,
        in the siege and in the distress with which your enemies
        shall distress you.
028:054 The man who is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall
        be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom,
        and toward the remnant of his children whom he has remaining;
028:055 so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his
        children whom he shall eat, because he has nothing left him,
        in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy shall
        distress you in all your gates.
028:056 The tender and delicate woman among you, who would not adventure
        to set the sole of her foot on the ground for delicateness
        and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband
        of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter,
028:057 and toward her young one who comes out from between her feet,
        and toward her children whom she shall bear; for she shall
        eat them for want of all things secretly, in the siege
        and in the distress with which your enemy shall distress you
        in your gates.
028:058 If you will not observe to do all the words of this law that
        are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious
        and fearful name, YAHWEH YOUR GOD;
028:059 then Yahweh will make your plagues wonderful, and the plagues
        of your seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance,
        and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.
028:060 He will bring on you again all the diseases of Egypt,
        which you were afraid of; and they shall cleave to you.
028:061 Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written
        in the book of this law, them will Yahweh bring on you,
        until you are destroyed.
028:062 You shall be left few in number, whereas you were as the stars
        of the sky for multitude; because you didn't listen to the voice
        of Yahweh your God.
028:063 It shall happen that as Yahweh rejoiced over you to do you good,
        and to multiply you, so Yahweh will rejoice over you to cause
        you to perish, and to destroy you; and you shall be plucked
        from off the land where you go in to possess it.
028:064 Yahweh will scatter you among all peoples, from the one
        end of the earth even to the other end of the earth;
        and there you shall serve other gods, which you have not known,
        you nor your fathers, even wood and stone.
028:065 Among these nations shall you find no ease, and there
        shall be no rest for the sole of your foot:  but Yahweh
        will give you there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes,
        and pining of soul;
028:066 and your life shall hang in doubt before you; and you shall
        fear night and day, and shall have no assurance of your life.
028:067 In the morning you shall say, Would it were even! and at even
        you shall say, Would it were morning! for the fear of your
        heart which you shall fear, and for the sight of your eyes
        which you shall see.
028:068 Yahweh will bring you into Egypt again with ships, by the way
        of which I said to you, You shall see it no more again:
        and there you shall sell yourselves to your enemies for
        bondservants and for bondmaids, and no man shall buy you.
029:001 These are the words of the covenant which Yahweh commanded
        Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab,
        besides the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.
029:002 Moses called to all Israel, and said to them, You have seen
        all that Yahweh did before your eyes in the land of Egypt
        to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land;
029:003 the great trials which your eyes saw, the signs,
        and those great wonders:
029:004 but Yahweh has not given you a heart to know, and eyes to see,
        and ears to hear, to this day.
029:005 I have led you forty years in the wilderness:  your clothes
        have not grown old on you, and your shoe has not grown old
        on your foot.
029:006 You have not eaten bread, neither have you drunk wine or strong drink;
        that you may know that I am Yahweh your God.
029:007 When you came to this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon,
        and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us to battle,
        and we struck them:
029:008 and we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance
        to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe
        of the Manassites.
029:009 Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them,
        that you may prosper in all that you do.
029:010 You stand this day all of you before Yahweh your God;
        your heads, your tribes, your elders, and your officers,
        even all the men of Israel,
029:011 your little ones, your wives, and your foreigner who is
        in the midst of your camps, from the one who cuts your wood
        to the one who draws your water;
029:012 that you may enter into the covenant of Yahweh your God,
        and into his oath, which Yahweh your God makes with you this day;
029:013 that he may establish you this day to himself for a people,
        and that he may be to you a God, as he spoke to you,
        and as he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac,
        and to Jacob.
029:014 Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath,
029:015 but with him who stands here with us this day before Yahweh
        our God, and also with him who is not here with us this day
029:016 (for you know how we lived in the land of Egypt, and how we came
        through the midst of the nations through which you passed;
029:017 and you have seen their abominations, and their idols,
        wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them);
029:018 lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family,
        or tribe, whose heart turns away this day from Yahweh our God,
        to go to serve the gods of those nations; lest there should
        be among you a root that bears gall and wormwood;
029:019 and it happen, when he hears the words of this curse,
        that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace,
        though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart, to destroy
        the moist with the dry.
029:020 Yahweh will not pardon him, but then the anger of Yahweh
        and his jealousy will smoke against that man, and all
        the curse that is written in this book shall lie on him,
        and Yahweh will blot out his name from under the sky.
029:021 Yahweh will set him apart to evil out of all the tribes of Israel,
        according to all the curses of the covenant that is written
        in this book of the law.
029:022 The generation to come, your children who shall rise up after you,
        and the foreigner who shall come from a far land, shall say,
        when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses
        with which Yahweh has made it sick;
029:023 [and that] the whole land of it is sulfur, and salt, [and] a burning,
        [that] it is not sown, nor bears, nor any grass grows therein,
        like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim,
        which Yahweh overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:
029:024 even all the nations shall say, Why has Yahweh done thus
        to this land? what means the heat of this great anger?
029:025 Then men shall say, Because they forsook the covenant of Yahweh,
        the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought
        them forth out of the land of Egypt,
029:026 and went and served other gods, and worshiped them, gods that
        they didn't know, and that he had not given to them:
029:027 therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled against this land,
        to bring on it all the curse that is written in this book;
029:028 and Yahweh rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath,
        and in great indignation, and cast them into another land,
        as at this day.
029:029 The secret things belong to Yahweh our God; but the things
        that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever,
        that we may do all the words of this law.
030:001 It shall happen, when all these things are come on you,
        the blessing and the curse, which I have set before you,
        and you shall call them to mind among all the nations,
        where Yahweh your God has driven you,
030:002 and shall return to Yahweh your God, and shall obey his voice
        according to all that I command you this day, you and your children,
        with all your heart, and with all your soul;
030:003 that then Yahweh your God will turn your captivity, and have
        compassion on you, and will return and gather you from all
        the peoples, where Yahweh your God has scattered you.
030:004 If [any of] your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of
        the heavens, from there will Yahweh your God gather you,
        and from there he will bring you back:
030:005 and Yahweh your God will bring you into the land which your
        fathers possessed, and you shall possess it; and he will do
        you good, and multiply you above your fathers.
030:006 Yahweh your God will circumcise your heart, and the heart
        of your seed, to love Yahweh your God with all your heart,
        and with all your soul, that you may live.
030:007 Yahweh your God will put all these curses on your enemies,
        and on those who hate you, who persecuted you.
030:008 You shall return and obey the voice of Yahweh, and do all his
        commandments which I command you this day.
030:009 Yahweh your God will make you plenteous in all the work
        of your hand, in the fruit of your body, and in the fruit
        of your livestock, and in the fruit of your ground, for good:
        for Yahweh will again rejoice over you for good, as he rejoiced
        over your fathers;
030:010 if you shall obey the voice of Yahweh your God, to keep his
        commandments and his statutes which are written in this book
        of the law; if you turn to Yahweh your God with all your heart,
        and with all your soul.
030:011 For this commandment which I command you this day, it is not
        too hard for you, neither is it far off.
030:012 It is not in heaven, that you should say, Who shall go up
        for us to heaven, and bring it to us, and make us to hear it,
        that we may do it?
030:013 Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, Who shall go
        over the sea for us, and bring it to us, and make us to hear it,
        that we may do it?
030:014 But the word is very near to you, in your mouth, and in your heart,
        that you may do it.
030:015 Behold, I have set before you this day life and good,
        and death and evil;
030:016 in that I command you this day to love Yahweh your God,
        to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his
        statutes and his ordinances, that you may live and multiply,
        and that Yahweh your God may bless you in the land where you
        go in to possess it.
030:017 But if your heart turn away, and you will not hear, but shall
        be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;
030:018 I denounce to you this day, that you shall surely perish;
        you shall not prolong your days in the land, where you pass
        over the Jordan to go in to possess it.
030:019 I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I
        have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse:
        therefore choose life, that you may live, you and your seed;
030:020 to love Yahweh your God, to obey his voice, and to cleave to him;
        for he is your life, and the length of your days; that you
        may dwell in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers,
        to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.
031:001 Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel.
031:002 He said to them, I am one hundred twenty years old this day;
        I can no more go out and come in:  and Yahweh has said to me,
        You shall not go over this Jordan.
031:003 Yahweh your God, he will go over before you; he will destroy
        these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess them:
        [and] Joshua, he shall go over before you, as Yahweh has spoken.
031:004 Yahweh will do to them as he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings
        of the Amorites, and to their land; whom he destroyed.
031:005 Yahweh will deliver them up before you, and you shall do to them
        according to all the commandment which I have commanded you.
031:006 Be strong and of good courage, don't be afraid, nor be scared
        of them:  for Yahweh your God, he it is who does go with you;
        he will not fail you, nor forsake you.
031:007 Moses called to Joshua, and said to him in the sight of
        all Israel, Be strong and of good courage:  for you shall
        go with this people into the land which Yahweh has sworn
        to their fathers to give them; and you shall cause them
        to inherit it.
031:008 Yahweh, he it is who does go before you; he will be with you,
        he will not fail you, neither forsake you:  don't be afraid,
        neither be dismayed.
031:009 Moses wrote this law, and delivered it to the priests the sons
        of Levi, who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh,
        and to all the elders of Israel.
031:010 Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of [every] seven years,
        in the set time of the year of release, in the feast of tents,
031:011 when all Israel is come to appear before Yahweh your God
        in the place which he shall choose, you shall read this law
        before all Israel in their hearing.
031:012 Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones,
        and your foreigner who is within your gates, that they
        may hear, and that they may learn, and fear Yahweh your God,
        and observe to do all the words of this law;
031:013 and that their children, who have not known, may hear,
        and learn to fear Yahweh your God, as long as you live
        in the land where you go over the Jordan to possess it.
031:014 Yahweh said to Moses, Behold, your days approach that you must die:
        call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tent of meeting,
        that I may give him a charge.  Moses and Joshua went,
        and presented themselves in the tent of meeting.
031:015 Yahweh appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud:
        and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the Tent.
031:016 Yahweh said to Moses, Behold, you shall sleep with your fathers;
        and this people will rise up, and play the prostitute after
        the strange gods of the land, where they go to be among them,
        and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have
        made with them.
031:017 Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day,
        and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them,
        and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles
        shall come on them; so that they will say in that day,
        Haven't these evils come on us because our God is not among us?
031:018 I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they
        shall have worked, in that they are turned to other gods.
031:019 Now therefore write you this song for you, and teach you it
        the children of Israel:  put it in their mouths, that this
        song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.
031:020 For when I shall have brought them into the land which I
        swore to their fathers, flowing with milk and honey,
        and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and grown fat;
        then will they turn to other gods, and serve them, and despise me,
        and break my covenant.
031:021 It shall happen, when many evils and troubles are come on them,
        that this song shall testify before them as a witness;
        for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed:
        for I know their imagination which they frame this day,
        before I have brought them into the land which I swore.
031:022 So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it
        the children of Israel.
031:023 He gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said,
        Be strong and of good courage; for you shall bring
        the children of Israel into the land which I swore to them:
        and I will be with you.
031:024 It happened, when Moses had made an end of writing the words
        of this law in a book, until they were finished,
031:025 that Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant
        of Yahweh, saying,
031:026 Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark
        of the covenant of Yahweh your God, that it may be there
        for a witness against you.
031:027 For I know your rebellion, and your stiff neck:  behold, while I
        am yet alive with you this day, you have been rebellious
        against Yahweh; and how much more after my death?
031:028 Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers,
        that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven
        and earth to witness against them.
031:029 For I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves,
        and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you;
        and evil will happen to you in the latter days; because you
        will do that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke
        him to anger through the work of your hands.
031:030 Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words
        of this song, until they were finished.
032:001 Give ear, you heavens, and I will speak.  Let the earth hear
        the words of my mouth.
032:002 My doctrine shall drop as the rain.  My speech shall
        condense as the dew, as the small rain on the tender grass,
        as the showers on the herb.
032:003 For I will proclaim the name of Yahweh.  Ascribe greatness
        to our God!
032:004 The Rock, his work is perfect, for all his ways are justice:
        a God of faithfulness and without iniquity, just and right is he.
032:005 They have dealt corruptly with him, [they are] not
        his children, [it is] their blemish.  [They are] a perverse
        and crooked generation.
032:006 Do you thus requite Yahweh, foolish people and unwise?
        Isn't he your father who has bought you?  He has made you,
        and established you.
032:007 Remember the days of old.  Consider the years of many generations.
        Ask your father, and he will show you; your elders, and they
        will tell you.
032:008 When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance,
        when he separated the children of men, he set the bounds of
        the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel.
032:009 For Yahweh's portion is his people.  Jacob is the lot
        of his inheritance.
032:010 He found him in a desert land, in the waste howling wilderness.
        He surrounded him.  He cared for him.  He kept him as the apple
        of his eye.
032:011 As an eagle that stirs up her nest, that flutters over her young,
        he spread abroad his wings, he took them, he bore them
        on his feathers.
032:012 Yahweh alone led him.  There was no foreign god with him.
032:013 He made him ride on the high places of the earth.
        He ate the increase of the field.  He caused him to suck
        honey out of the rock, oil out of the flinty rock;
032:014 Butter of the herd, and milk of the flock, with fat of lambs, rams of
        the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the finest of the wheat.
        Of the blood of the grape you drank wine.
032:015 But Jeshurun grew fat, and kicked.  You have grown fat.
        You have grown thick.  You have become sleek.
        Then he forsook God who made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock
        of his salvation.
032:016 They moved him to jealousy with strange [gods]. They provoked
        him to anger with abominations.
032:017 They sacrificed to demons, [which were] no God, to gods
        that they didn't know, to new [gods] that came up of late,
        which your fathers didn't dread.
032:018 Of the Rock who became your father, you are unmindful,
        and have forgotten God who gave you birth.
032:019 Yahweh saw [it], and abhorred [them], because of the provocation
        of his sons and his daughters.
032:020 He said, I will hide my face from them.  I will see what their
        end shall be; for they are a very perverse generation,
        children in whom is no faithfulness.
032:021 They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God.
        They have provoked me to anger with their vanities.
        I will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people.
        I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.
032:022 For a fire is kindled in my anger, Burns to the lowest
        Sheol, Devours the earth with its increase, and sets
        the foundations of the mountains on fire.
032:023 I will heap evils on them.  I will spend my arrows on them.
032:024 [They shall be] wasted with hunger, and devoured with burning
        heat and bitter destruction.  I will send the teeth of animals
        on them, With the poison of crawling things of the dust.
032:025 Outside the sword shall bereave, and in the chambers, terror; on both
        young man and virgin, The suckling with the gray-haired man.
032:026 I said, I would scatter them afar.  I would make the memory
        of them to cease from among men;
032:027 were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy,
        lest their adversaries should judge wrongly, lest they should say,
        Our hand is exalted, Yahweh has not done all this.
032:028 For they are a nation void of counsel.  There is no
        understanding in them.
032:029 Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, that they
        would consider their latter end!
032:030 How could one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand
        to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, and Yahweh had
        delivered them up?
032:031 For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies
        themselves being judges.
032:032 For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, of the fields of Gomorrah.
        Their grapes are grapes of gall, Their clusters are bitter.
032:033 Their wine is the poison of serpents, The cruel venom of asps.
032:034 Isn't this laid up in store with me, sealed up among my treasures?
032:035 Vengeance is mine, and recompense, at the time when their
        foot slides; for the day of their calamity is at hand.
        The things that are to come on them shall make haste.
032:036 For Yahweh will judge his people, and have compassion
        on his servants, when he sees that [their] power is gone,
        There is none [remaining], shut up or left at large.
032:037 He will say, Where are their gods, The rock in which
        they took refuge;
032:038 Which ate the fat of their sacrifices, And drank the wine
        of their drink offering?  Let them rise up and help you!
        Let them be your protection.
032:039 See now that I, even I, am he, There is no god with me.
        I kill, and I make alive.  I wound, and I heal.
        There is no one who can deliver out of my hand.
032:040 For I lift up my hand to heaven, And say, As I live forever,
032:041 if I whet my glittering sword, My hand take hold on judgment;
        I will render vengeance to my adversaries, and will recompense
        those who hate me.
032:042 I will make my arrows drunk with blood.  My sword shall
        devour flesh with the blood of the slain and the captives,
        from the head of the leaders of the enemy.
032:043 Rejoice, you nations, [with] his people, for he will avenge
        the blood of his servants.  He will render vengeance
        to his adversaries, And will make expiation for his land,
        for his people.
032:044 Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears
        of the people, he and Joshua the son of Nun.
032:045 Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel;
032:046 He said to them, Set your heart to all the words which I
        testify to you this day, which you shall command your children
        to observe to do, [even] all the words of this law.
032:047 For it is no vain thing for you; because it is your life,
        and through this thing you shall prolong your days in the land,
        where you go over the Jordan to possess it.
032:048 Yahweh spoke to Moses that same day, saying,
032:049 Go up into this mountain of Abarim, to Mount Nebo,
        which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho;
        and see the land of Canaan, which I give to the children
        of Israel for a possession;
032:050 and die on the mountain where you go up, and be gathered
        to your people, as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor,
        and was gathered to his people:
032:051 because you trespassed against me in the midst of the children
        of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness
        of Zin; because you didn't sanctify me in the midst of
        the children of Israel.
032:052 For you shall see the land before you; but you shall not go
        there into the land which I give the children of Israel.
033:001 This is the blessing, with which Moses the man of God blessed
        the children of Israel before his death.
033:002 He said, Yahweh came from Sinai, And rose from Seir to them.
        He shone forth from Mount Paran.  He came from the ten thousands
        of holy ones.  At his right hand was a fiery law for them.
033:003 Yes, he loves the people.  All his saints are in your hand.
        They sat down at your feet; [Everyone] shall receive
        of your words.
033:004 Moses commanded us a law, An inheritance for the assembly of Jacob.
033:005 He was king in Jeshurun, When the heads of the people were gathered,
        All the tribes of Israel together.
033:006 Let Reuben live, and not die; Nor let his men be few.
033:007 This is [the blessing] of Judah:  and he said, Hear, Yahweh,
        the voice of Judah.  Bring him in to his people.
        With his hands he contended for himself.  You shall be a help
        against his adversaries.
033:008 Of Levi he said, Your Thummim and your Urim are with your
        godly one, whom you proved at Massah, with whom you strove
        at the waters of Meribah;
033:009 who said of his father, and of his mother, I have not seen him;
        Neither did he acknowledge his brothers, Nor did he know
        his own children:  For they have observed your word,
        and keep your covenant.
033:010 They shall teach Jacob your ordinances, and Israel your law.
        They shall put incense before you, and whole burnt offering
        on your altar.
033:011 Yahweh, bless his substance.  Accept the work of his hands.
        Strike through the hips of those who rise up against him,
        of those who hate him, that they not rise again.
033:012 Of Benjamin he said, The beloved of Yahweh shall dwell
        in safety by him.  He covers him all the day long.
        He dwells between his shoulders.
033:013 Of Joseph he said, His land is blessed by Yahweh, for the
        precious things of the heavens, for the dew, for the deep
        that couches beneath,
033:014 for the precious things of the fruits of the sun, for the precious
        things of the growth of the moons,
033:015 for the chief things of the ancient mountains, for the precious
        things of the everlasting hills,
033:016 for the precious things of the earth and its fullness,
        the good will of him who lived in the bush{i. e.
        the burning bush of Exodus 3:3-4.}. Let [the blessing] come
        on the head of Joseph, On the crown of the head of him who was
        separate from his brothers.
033:017 The firstborn of his herd, majesty is his.  His horns are
        the horns of the wild ox.  With them he shall push the peoples
        all of them, [even] the ends of the earth:  They are the ten
        thousands of Ephraim.  They are the thousands of Manasseh.
033:018 Of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out;
        and Issachar, in your tents.
033:019 They shall call the peoples to the mountain.  There they will
        offer sacrifices of righteousness, for they shall draw out
        the abundance of the seas, the hidden treasures of the sand.
033:020 Of Gad he said, He who enlarges Gad is blessed.
        He dwells as a lioness, and tears the arm, yes, the crown
        of the head.
033:021 He provided the first part for himself, for there was the lawgiver's
        portion reserved.  He came [with] the heads of the people.
        He executed the righteousness of Yahweh, His ordinances with Israel.
033:022 Of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's cub that leaps out of Bashan.
033:023 Of Naphtali he said, Naphtali, satisfied with favor, full of
        the blessing of Yahweh, Possess the west and the south.
033:024 Of Asher he said, Asher is blessed with children.
        Let him be acceptable to his brothers.  Let him dip his
        foot in oil.
033:025 Your bars shall be iron and brass.  As your days, so shall
        your strength be.
033:026 There is none like God, Jeshurun, who rides on the heavens
        for your help, In his excellency on the skies.
033:027 The eternal God is [your] dwelling place.  Underneath are
        the everlasting arms.  He thrust out the enemy from before you,
        and said, Destroy.
033:028 Israel dwells in safety; the fountain of Jacob alone, In a land
        of grain and new wine.  Yes, his heavens drop down dew.
033:029 You are happy, Israel.  Who is like you, a people saved by Yahweh,
        the shield of your help, the sword of your excellency!
        Your enemies shall submit themselves to you.  You shall tread
        on their high places.
034:001 Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo,
        to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho.
        Yahweh showed him all the land of Gilead, to Dan,
034:002 and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh,
        and all the land of Judah, to the hinder sea,
034:003 and the South, and the Plain of the valley of Jericho the city
        of palm trees, to Zoar.
034:004 Yahweh said to him, This is the land which I swore to Abraham,
        to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, I will give it to your seed:
        I have caused you to see it with your eyes, but you shall
        not go over there.
034:005 So Moses the servant of Yahweh died there in the land of Moab,
        according to the word of Yahweh.
034:006 He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab over against
        Beth Peor:  but no man knows of his tomb to this day.
034:007 Moses was one hundred twenty years old when he died:
        his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.
034:008 The children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab
        thirty days:  so the days of weeping in the mourning for
        Moses were ended.
034:009 Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom;
        for Moses had laid his hands on him:  and the children of Israel
        listened to him, and did as Yahweh commanded Moses.
034:010 There has not arisen a prophet since in Israel like Moses,
        whom Yahweh knew face to face,
034:011 in all the signs and the wonders, which Yahweh sent him to do
        in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants,
        and to all his land,
034:012 and in all the mighty hand, and in all the great terror,
        which Moses worked in the sight of all Israel.
Book 06 Joshua
001:001 Now it happened after the death of Moses the servant of Yahweh,
        that Yahweh spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' servant, saying,
001:002 Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan,
        you, and all this people, to the land which I give to them,
        even to the children of Israel.
001:003 I have given you every place that the sole of your foot will
        tread on, as I told Moses.
001:004 From the wilderness, and this Lebanon, even to the great river,
        the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites,
        and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun,
        shall be your border.
001:005 No man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life.
        As I was with Moses, so I will be with you.  I will not fail
        you nor forsake you.
001:006 Be strong and of good courage; for you shall cause this
        people to inherit the land which I swore to their fathers
        to give them.
001:007 Only be strong and very courageous, to observe to do according
        to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded you.
        Don't turn from it to the right hand or to the left,
        that you may have good success wherever you go.
001:008 This book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth,
        but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may
        observe to do according to all that is written therein:
        for then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you
        shall have good success.
001:009 Haven't I commanded you?  Be strong and of good courage.
        Don't be afraid, neither be dismayed:  for Yahweh your God
        is with you wherever you go.
001:010 Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
001:011 "Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people,
        saying, 'Prepare food; for within three days you are to pass
        over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which Yahweh
        your God gives you to possess it.'"
001:012 Joshua spoke to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to
        the half-tribe of Manasseh, saying,
001:013 "Remember the word which Moses the servant of Yahweh
        commanded you, saying, 'Yahweh your God gives you rest,
        and will give you this land.
001:014 Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock, shall live
        in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan; but you
        shall pass over before your brothers armed, all the mighty
        men of valor, and shall help them
001:015 until Yahweh has given your brothers rest, as he has given you,
        and they have also possessed the land which Yahweh your God
        gives them.  Then you shall return to the land of your possession,
        and possess it, which Moses the servant of Yahweh gave you
        beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise.'"
001:016 They answered Joshua, saying, "All that you have commanded us
        we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.
001:017 Just as we listened to Moses in all things, so will we listen to you.
        Only may Yahweh your God be with you, as he was with Moses.
001:018 Whoever rebels against your commandment, and doesn't listen to your
        words in all that you command him, he shall be put to death.
        Only be strong and of good courage."
002:001 Joshua the son of Nun secretly sent two men out of Shittim
        as spies, saying, "Go, view the land, and Jericho."
        They went and came into the house of a prostitute whose name
        was Rahab, and slept there.
002:002 The king of Jericho was told, "Behold, men of the children
        of Israel came in here tonight to spy out the land."
002:003 The king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, "Bring out the men
        who have come to you, who have entered into your house;
        for they have come to spy out all the land."
002:004 The woman took the two men and hid them.  Then she said, "Yes,
        the men came to me, but I didn't know where they came from.
002:005 It happened about the time of the shutting of the gate, when it
        was dark, that the men went out.  Where the men went, I don't know.
        Pursue them quickly; for you will overtake them."
002:006 But she had brought them up to the roof, and hid them with
        the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order on the roof.
002:007 The men pursued them the way to the Jordan to the fords:
        and as soon as those who pursued them had gone out,
        they shut the gate.
002:008 Before they had laid down, she came up to them on the roof;
002:009 and she said to the men, "I know that Yahweh has given
        you the land, and that the fear of you has fallen on us,
        and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you.
002:010 For we have heard how Yahweh dried up the water of the
        Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds} before you, when you came out of Egypt;
        and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond
        the Jordan, to Sihon and to Og, whom you utterly destroyed.
002:011 As soon as we had heard it, our hearts melted, neither did
        there remain any more spirit in any man, because of you:
        for Yahweh your God, he is God in heaven above,
        and on earth beneath.
002:012 Now therefore, please swear to me by Yahweh, since I have dealt
        kindly with you, that you also will deal kindly with my
        father's house, and give me a true token;
002:013 and that you will save alive my father, my mother, my brothers,
        and my sisters, and all that they have, and will deliver
        our lives from death."
002:014 The men said to her, "Our life for yours, if you don't talk
        about this business of ours; and it shall be, when Yahweh gives
        us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with you."
002:015 Then she let them down by a cord through the window;
        for her house was on the side of the wall, and she lived
        on the wall.
002:016 She said to them, "Go to the mountain, lest the pursuers find you;
        and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers
        have returned.  Afterward, you may go your way."
002:017 The men said to her, "We will be guiltless of this your oath
        which you have made us to swear.
002:018 Behold, when we come into the land, you shall bind this line
        of scarlet thread in the window which you did let us down by.
        You shall gather to yourself into the house your father,
        your mother, your brothers, and all your father's household.
002:019 It shall be that whoever goes out of the doors of your house into
        the street, his blood will be on his head, and we will be guiltless.
        Whoever is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head,
        if any hand is on him.
002:020 But if you talk about this business of ours, then we shall
        be guiltless of your oath which you have made us to swear."
002:021 She said, "According to your words, so be it."  She sent them away,
        and they departed.  She tied the scarlet line in the window.
002:022 They went, and came to the mountain, and stayed there three days,
        until the pursuers had returned.  The pursuers sought them
        throughout all the way, but didn't find them.
002:023 Then the two men returned, descended from the mountain,
        passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun; and they told
        him all that had happened to them.
002:024 They said to Joshua, "Truly Yahweh has delivered into our hands
        all the land.  Moreover, all the inhabitants of the land melt
        away before us."
003:001 Joshua rose up early in the morning; and they moved from Shittim,
        and came to the Jordan, he and all the children of Israel.
        They lodged there before they passed over.
003:002 It happened after three days, that the officers went through
        the midst of the camp;
003:003 and they commanded the people, saying, "When you see the ark
        of the covenant of Yahweh your God, and the priests
        the Levites bearing it, then you shall move from your place,
        and follow it.
003:004 Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two
        thousand cubits by measure.  Don't come near to it, that you
        may know the way by which you must go; for you have not passed
        this way before."
003:005 Joshua said to the people, "Sanctify yourselves; for tomorrow
        Yahweh will do wonders among you."
003:006 Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, "Take up the ark
        of the covenant, and pass over before the people."
        They took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.
003:007 Yahweh said to Joshua, "Today I will begin to magnify you
        in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that as I
        was with Moses, so I will be with you.
003:008 You shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant,
        saying, 'When you come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan,
        you shall stand still in the Jordan.'"
003:009 Joshua said to the children of Israel, "Come here, and hear
        the words of Yahweh your God."
003:010 Joshua said, "Hereby you shall know that the living God is
        among you, and that he will without fail drive the Canaanite,
        and the Hittite, and the Hivite, and the Perizzite,
        and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Jebusite out
        from before you.
003:011 Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth
        passes over before you into the Jordan.
003:012 Now therefore take twelve men out of the tribes of Israel,
        for every tribe a man.
003:013 It shall come to pass, when the soles of the feet of the priests
        who bear the ark of Yahweh, the Lord of all the earth,
        rest in the waters of the Jordan, that the waters of the Jordan
        will be cut off, even the waters that come down from above;
        and they shall stand in one heap."
003:014 It happened, when the people moved from their tents to pass
        over the Jordan, the priests who bore the ark of the covenant
        being before the people,
003:015 and when those who bore the ark had come to the Jordan,
        and the feet of the priests who bore the ark had dipped
        in the edge of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its
        banks all the time of harvest),
003:016 that the waters which came down from above stood, and rose
        up in one heap, a great way off, at Adam, the city that is
        beside Zarethan; and those that went down toward the sea
        of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off.
        Then the people passed over right against Jericho.
003:017 The priests who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh
        stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan;
        and all Israel passed over on dry ground, until all the nation
        had passed completely over the Jordan.
004:001 It happened, when all the nation had completely passed over
        the Jordan, that Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,
004:002 "Take twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,
004:003 and command them, saying, 'Take from out of the middle of
        the Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm,
        twelve stones, and carry them over with you, and lay them
        down in the lodging place, where you will lodge tonight.'"
004:004 Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared
        of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man.
004:005 Joshua said to them, "Pass over before the ark of Yahweh your
        God into the middle of the Jordan, and each of you pick up
        a stone and put it on your shoulder, according to the number
        of the tribes of the children of Israel;
004:006 that this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask
        in time to come, saying, 'What do you mean by these stones?'
004:007 then you shall tell them, 'Because the waters of the Jordan
        were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh.
        When it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were
        cut off.  These stones shall be for a memorial to the children
        of Israel forever.'"
004:008 The children of Israel did as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve
        stones out of the middle of the Jordan, as Yahweh spoke to Joshua,
        according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel;
        and they carried them over with them to the place where they lodged,
        and laid them down there.
004:009 Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan,
        in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark
        of the covenant stood; and they are there to this day.
004:010 For the priests who bore the ark stood in the middle of the Jordan,
        until everything was finished that Yahweh commanded Joshua to speak
        to the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua;
        and the people hurried and passed over.
004:011 It happened, when all the people had completely passed over,
        that the ark of Yahweh passed over, with the priests,
        in the presence of the people.
004:012 The children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe
        of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel,
        as Moses spoke to them.
004:013 About forty thousand men, ready and armed for war passed
        over before Yahweh to battle, to the plains of Jericho.
004:014 On that day, Yahweh magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel;
        and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days
        of his life.
004:015 Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,
004:016 "Command the priests who bear the ark of the testimony,
        that they come up out of the Jordan."
004:017 Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, "Come up out
        of the Jordan!"
004:018 It happened, when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant
        of Yahweh had come up out of the middle of the Jordan,
        and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up to the dry ground,
        that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place,
        and went over all its banks, as before.
004:019 The people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day
        of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the east
        border of Jericho.
004:020 Joshua set up those twelve stones, which they took out of
        the Jordan, n Gilgal.
004:021 He spoke to the children of Israel, saying, "When your
        children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, 'What do
        these stones mean?'
004:022 Then you shall let your children know, saying, 'Israel came
        over this Jordan on dry land.
004:023 For Yahweh your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from
        before you, until you had passed over, as Yahweh your God
        did to the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}, which he dried up
        from before us, until we had passed over;
004:024 that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of Yahweh,
        that it is mighty; that you may fear Yahweh your God forever.'"
005:001 It happened, when all the kings of the Amorites, who were beyond
        the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites,
        who were by the sea, heard how that Yahweh had dried up
        the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel,
        until we had passed over, that their heart melted, neither was
        there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.
005:002 At that time, Yahweh said to Joshua, "Make flint knives,
        and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time."
005:003 Joshua made himself flint knives, and circumcised the children
        of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.
005:004 This is the reason Joshua circumcised:  all the people who came
        out of Egypt, who were males, even all the men of war,
        died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.
005:005 For all the people who came out were circumcised; but all
        the people who were born in the wilderness by the way as they
        came out of Egypt had not been circumcised.
005:006 For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness,
        until all the nation, even the men of war who came out of Egypt,
        were consumed, because they didn't listen to the voice of Yahweh.
        Yahweh swore to them that he wouldn't let them see the land
        which Yahweh swore to their fathers that he would give us,
        a land flowing with milk and honey.
005:007 Their children, whom he raised up in their place,
        were circumcised by Joshua; for they were uncircumcised,
        because they had not circumcised them on the way.
005:008 It happened, when they were done circumcising all the nation,
        that they stayed in their places in the camp until
        they were healed.
005:009 Yahweh said to Joshua, "Today I have rolled away the reproach
        of Egypt from off you."  Therefore the name of that place
        was called Gilgal,{"Gilgal" sounds like the Hebrew for "roll."
        } to this day.
005:010 The children of Israel encamped in Gilgal.  They kept
        the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening
        in the plains of Jericho.
005:011 They ate unleavened cakes and parched grain of the produce
        of the land on the next day after the Passover, in the same day.
005:012 The manna ceased on the next day, after they had eaten of the produce
        of the land.  The children of Israel didn't have manna any more;
        but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.
005:013 It happened, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up
        his eyes and looked, and behold, a man stood in front of him
        with his sword drawn in his hand.  Joshua went to him,
        and said to him, "Are you for us, or for our adversaries?"
005:014 He said, "No; but I have come now as commander of Yahweh's army."
        Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshipped,
        and said to him, "What does my lord say to his servant?"
005:015 The prince of Yahweh's army said to Joshua, "Take your shoes
        off of your feet; for the place on which you stand is holy."
        Joshua did so.
006:001 Now Jericho was tightly shut up because of the children of Israel.
        No one went out, and no one came in.
006:002 Yahweh said to Joshua, "Behold, I have given Jericho into your hand,
        with its king and the mighty men of valor.
006:003 All your men of war shall march around the city, going around
        the city once.  You shall do this six days.
006:004 Seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before
        the ark.  On the seventh day, you shall march around the city
        seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets.
006:005 It shall be that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn,
        and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people
        shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city
        shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up every man
        straight before him."
006:006 Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them,
        "Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear
        seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of Yahweh."
006:007 They said to the people, "Advance!  March around the city,
        and let the armed men pass on before Yahweh's ark."
006:008 It was so, that when Joshua had spoken to the people,
        the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams'
        horns before Yahweh advanced, and blew the trumpets;
        and the ark of the covenant of Yahweh followed them.
006:009 The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets,
        and the ark went after them.  The trumpets sounded as they went.
006:010 Joshua commanded the people, saying, "You shall not shout,
        nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed
        out of your mouth, until the day I tell you to shout.
        Then you shall shout."
006:011 So he caused the ark of Yahweh to go around the city,
        going about it once.  Then they came into the camp, and lodged
        in the camp.
006:012 Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up
        the ark of Yahweh.
006:013 The seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams'
        horns before the ark of Yahweh went on continually,
        and blew the trumpets:  and the armed men went before them.
        The rear guard came after the ark of Yahweh.  The trumpets
        sounded as they went.
006:014 The second day they marched around the city once, and returned
        into the camp.  They did this six days.
006:015 It happened on the seventh day, that they rose early at the dawning
        of the day, and marched around the city in the same way seven times.
        Only on this day they marched around the city seven times.
006:016 It happened at the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets,
        Joshua said to the people, "Shout, for Yahweh has given
        you the city!
006:017 The city shall be devoted, even it and all that is in it, to Yahweh.
        Only Rahab the prostitute shall live, she and all who are with
        her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.
006:018 But as for you, only keep yourselves from the devoted thing,
        lest when you have devoted it, you take of the devoted thing;
        so would you make the camp of Israel accursed, and trouble it.
006:019 But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron,
        are holy to Yahweh.  They shall come into Yahweh's treasury."
006:020 So the people shouted, and the priests blew the trumpets.
        It happened, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet,
        that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall
        fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city,
        every man straight before him, and they took the city.
006:021 They utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man
        and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and donkey,
        with the edge of the sword.
006:022 Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land,
        "Go into the prostitute's house, and bring out from there
        the woman and all that she has, as you swore to her."
006:023 The young men who were spies went in, and brought out Rahab
        with her father, her mother, her brothers, and all that she had.
        They also brought out all her relatives, and they set them
        outside of the camp of Israel.
006:024 They burnt the city with fire, and all that was in it.
        Only they put the silver, the gold, and the vessels of brass
        and of iron into the treasury of Yahweh's house.
006:025 But Rahab the prostitute, her father's household, and all
        that she had, Joshua saved alive.  She lived in the midst
        of Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers,
        whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
006:026 Joshua charged them with an oath at that time, saying, "Cursed be
        the man before Yahweh, who rises up and builds this city Jericho.
        With the loss of his firstborn shall he lay its foundation,
        and with the loss of his youngest son shall he set up its gates."
006:027 So Yahweh was with Joshua; and his fame was in all the land.
007:001 But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted thing;
        for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son
        of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the devoted thing:
        and the anger of Yahweh was kindled against the children of Israel.
007:002 Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth Aven,
        on the east side of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, Go up
        and spy out the land.  The men went up and spied out Ai.
007:003 They returned to Joshua, and said to him, Don't let all
        the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go
        up and strike Ai; don't make all the people to toil there;
        for they are but few.
007:004 So there went up there of the people about three thousand men:
        and they fled before the men of Ai.
007:005 The men of Ai struck of them about thirty-six men; and they
        chased them [from] before the gate even to Shebarim, and struck
        them at the descent; and the hearts of the people melted,
        and became as water.
007:006 Joshua tore his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before
        the ark of Yahweh until the evening, he and the elders of Israel;
        and they put dust on their heads.
007:007 Joshua said, Alas, Lord Yahweh, why have you at all brought
        this people over the Jordan, to deliver us into the hand
        of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? would that we had been
        content and lived beyond the Jordan!
007:008 Oh, Lord, what shall I say, after that Israel has turned
        their backs before their enemies!
007:009 For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will
        hear of it, and will compass us round, and cut off our name
        from the earth:  and what will you do for your great name?
007:010 Yahweh said to Joshua, Get you up; why are you thus fallen
        on your face?
007:011 Israel has sinned; yes, they have even transgressed my
        covenant which I commanded them:  yes, they have even taken
        of the devoted thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also;
        and they have even put it among their own stuff.
007:012 Therefore the children of Israel can't stand before their enemies;
        they turn their backs before their enemies, because they
        are become accursed:  I will not be with you any more,
        except you destroy the devoted thing from among you.
007:013 Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves
        against tomorrow:  for thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, There is
        a devoted thing in the midst of you, Israel; you can not stand
        before your enemies, until you take away the devoted thing
        from among you.
007:014 In the morning therefore you shall be brought near by your tribes:
        and it shall be, that the tribe which Yahweh takes shall come
        near by families; and the family which Yahweh shall take
        shall come near by households; and the household which Yahweh
        shall take shall come near man by man.
007:015 It shall be, that he who is taken with the devoted thing shall
        be burnt with fire, he and all that he has; because he has
        transgressed the covenant of Yahweh, and because he has done
        folly in Israel.
007:016 So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel
        near by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:
007:017 and he brought near the family of Judah; and he took the family
        of the Zerahites:  and he brought near the family of the Zerahites
        man by man; and Zabdi was taken:
007:018 and he brought near his household man by man; and Achan,
        the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah,
        of the tribe of Judah, was taken.
007:019 Joshua said to Achan, My son, please give glory to Yahweh,
        the God of Israel, and make confession to him; and tell me
        now what you have done; don't hide it from me.
007:020 Achan answered Joshua, and said, Of a truth I have sinned
        against Yahweh, the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:
007:021 when I saw among the spoil a goodly Babylonian mantle,
        and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold
        of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them;
        and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent,
        and the silver under it.
007:022 So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and, behold,
        it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.
007:023 They took them from the midst of the tent, and brought them
        to Joshua, and to all the children of Israel; and they laid
        them down before Yahweh.
007:024 Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah,
        and the silver, and the mantle, and the wedge of gold,
        and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his donkeys,
        and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had:
        and they brought them up to the valley of Achor.
007:025 Joshua said, Why have you troubled us?  Yahweh shall
        trouble you this day.  All Israel stoned him with stones;
        and they burned them with fire, and stoned them with stones.
007:026 They raised over him a great heap of stones, to this day;
        and Yahweh turned from the fierceness of his anger.
        Therefore the name of that place was called "The valley of Achor"
        to this day.
008:001 Yahweh said to Joshua, Don't be afraid, neither be dismayed:
        take all the people of war with you, and arise, go up
        to Ai; behold, I have given into your hand the king of Ai,
        and his people, and his city, and his land;
008:002 You shall do to Ai and her king as you did to Jericho and her king:
        only the spoil of it, and the livestock of it, shall you
        take for a prey to yourselves:  set you an ambush for the
        city behind it.
008:003 So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai:
        and Joshua chose out thirty thousand men, the mighty men of valor,
        and sent them forth by night.
008:004 He commanded them, saying, Behold, you shall lie in ambush against
        the city, behind the city; don't go very far from the city,
        but be all ready:
008:005 and I, and all the people who are with me, will approach to the city.
        It shall happen, when they come out against us, as at the first,
        that we will flee before them;
008:006 and they will come out after us, until we have drawn them
        away from the city; for they will say, They flee before us,
        as at the first:  so we will flee before them;
008:007 and you shall rise up from the ambush, and take possession of
        the city:  for Yahweh your God will deliver it into your hand.
008:008 It shall be, when you have seized on the city, that you shall set
        the city on fire; according to the word of Yahweh shall you do:
        behold, I have commanded you.
008:009 Joshua sent them forth; and they went to set up the ambush,
        and stayed between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai:
        but Joshua lodged that night among the people.
008:010 Joshua arose up early in the morning, and mustered the people,
        and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.
008:011 All the people, [even] the [men of] war who were with him,
        went up, and drew near, and came before the city, and encamped
        on the north side of Ai:  now there was a valley between
        him and Ai.
008:012 He took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between
        Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.
008:013 So they set the people, even all the army who was on the north
        of the city, and their ambush on the west of the city;
        and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.
008:014 It happened, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hurried
        and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against
        Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time appointed,
        before the Arabah; but he didn't know that there was an ambush
        against him behind the city.
008:015 Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them,
        and fled by the way of the wilderness.
008:016 All the people who were in the city were called together
        to pursue after them:  and they pursued after Joshua,
        and were drawn away from the city.
008:017 There was not a man left in Ai or Beth El, who didn't
        go out after Israel:  and they left the city open,
        and pursued after Israel.
008:018 Yahweh said to Joshua, Stretch out the javelin that is in
        your hand toward Ai; for I will give it into your hand.
        Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand
        toward the city.
008:019 The ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon
        as he had stretched out his hand, and entered into the city,
        and took it; and they hurried and set the city on fire.
008:020 When the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and behold,
        the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no
        power to flee this way or that way:  and the people who fled
        to the wilderness turned back on the pursuers.
008:021 When Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city,
        and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again,
        and killed the men of Ai.
008:022 The others came forth out of the city against them;
        so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side,
        and some on that side:  and they struck them, so that they
        let none of them remain or escape.
008:023 The king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.
008:024 It happened, when Israel had made an end of killing all the
        inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness in which they
        pursued them, and they were all fallen by the edge of the sword,
        until they were consumed, that all Israel returned to Ai,
        and struck it with the edge of the sword.
008:025 All that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand,
        even all the men of Ai.
008:026 For Joshua didn't draw back his hand, with which he stretched
        out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the
        inhabitants of Ai.
008:027 Only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took
        for prey to themselves, according to the word of Yahweh
        which he commanded Joshua.
008:028 So Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap forever, even a desolation,
        to this day.
008:029 The king of Ai he hanged on a tree until the evening:
        and at the going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they
        took his body down from the tree, and cast it at the entrance
        of the gate of the city, and raised thereon a great heap
        of stones, to this day.
008:030 Then Joshua built an altar to Yahweh, the God of Israel,
        in Mount Ebal,
008:031 as Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded the children of Israel,
        as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar
        of uncut stones, on which no man had lifted up any iron:
        and they offered thereon burnt offerings to Yahweh,
        and sacrificed peace offerings.
008:032 He wrote there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses,
        which he wrote, in the presence of the children of Israel.
008:033 All Israel, and their elders and officers, and their judges,
        stood on this side of the ark and on that side before the priests
        the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh,
        as well the foreigner as the native; half of them in front
        of Mount Gerizim, and half of them in front of Mount Ebal;
        as Moses the servant of Yahweh had commanded at the first,
        that they should bless the people of Israel.
008:034 Afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing
        and the curse, according to all that is written in the book
        of the law.
008:035 There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua
        didn't read before all the assembly of Israel, and the women,
        and the little ones, and the foreigners who were among them.
009:001 It happened, when all the kings who were beyond the Jordan,
        in the hill country, and in the lowland, and on all the shore
        of the great sea in front of Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite,
        the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite,
        heard of it;
009:002 that they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua
        and with Israel, with one accord.
009:003 But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done
        to Jericho and to Ai,
009:004 they also resorted to a ruse, and went and made as if they
        had been ambassadors, and took old sacks on their donkeys,
        and wineskins, old and torn and bound up,
009:005 and old and patched shoes on their feet, and old garments on them;
        and all the bread of their provision was dry and was become moldy.
009:006 They went to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him,
        and to the men of Israel, We are come from a far country:
        now therefore make you a covenant with us.
009:007 The men of Israel said to the Hivites, What if you dwell among us;
        and how shall we make a covenant with you?
009:008 They said to Joshua, We are your servants.  Joshua said to them,
        Who are you? and from whence come you?
009:009 They said to him, From a very far country your servants
        are come because of the name of Yahweh your God:
        for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,
009:010 and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites,
        who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon,
        and to Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.
009:011 Our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke
        to us, saying, Take provision in your hand for the journey,
        and go to meet them, and tell them, We are your servants:
        and now make you a covenant with us.
009:012 This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses
        on the day we came forth to go to you; but now, behold, it is dry,
        and is become moldy:
009:013 and these wineskins, which we filled, were new; and behold,
        they are torn:  and these our garments and our shoes are become
        old by reason of the very long journey.
009:014 The men took of their provision, and didn't ask counsel at
        the mouth of Yahweh.
009:015 Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them,
        to let them live:  and the princes of the congregation
        swore to them.
009:016 It happened at the end of three days after they had made a covenant
        with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors,
        and that they lived among them.
009:017 The children of Israel traveled, and came to their cities on
        the third day.  Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah,
        and Beeroth, and Kiriath Jearim.
009:018 The children of Israel didn't strike them, because the princes
        of the congregation had sworn to them by Yahweh, the God of Israel.
        All the congregation murmured against the princes.
009:019 But all the princes said to all the congregation,
        We have sworn to them by Yahweh, the God of Israel:
        now therefore we may not touch them.
009:020 This we will do to them, and let them live; lest wrath be on us,
        because of the oath which we swore to them.
009:021 The princes said to them, Let them live:  so they became
        wood cutters and drawers of water to all the congregation,
        as the princes had spoken to them.
009:022 Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying,
        Why have you deceived us, saying, We are very far from you;
        when you dwell among us?
009:023 Now therefore you are cursed, and there shall never fail to be
        of you bondservants, both wood cutters and drawers of water
        for the house of my God.
009:024 They answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly
        told your servants, how that Yahweh your God commanded
        his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to
        destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you;
        therefore we were sore afraid for our lives because of you,
        and have done this thing.
009:025 Now, behold, we are in your hand:  as it seems good and right
        to you to do to us, do.
009:026 So did he to them, and delivered them out of the hand of
        the children of Israel, that they didn't kill them.
009:027 That day Joshua made those wood cutters and drawers of water
        for the congregation, and for the altar of Yahweh, to this day,
        in the place which he should choose.
010:001 Now it happened, when Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua
        had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done
        to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king;
        and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel,
        and were among them;
010:002 that they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city,
        as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai,
        and all the men of it were mighty.
010:003 Therefore Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron,
        and to Piram king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia king of Lachish,
        and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,
010:004 Come up to me, and help me, and let us strike Gibeon; for it
        has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.
010:005 Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem,
        the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish,
        the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up,
        they and all their armies, and encamped against Gibeon,
        and made war against it.
010:006 The men of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the camp to Gilgal,
        saying, Don't slack your hand from your servants;
        come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us:
        for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill
        country are gathered together against us.
010:007 So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war
        with him, and all the mighty men of valor.
010:008 Yahweh said to Joshua, Don't fear them:  for I have delivered
        them into your hands; there shall not a man of them
        stand before you.
010:009 Joshua therefore came on them suddenly; [for] he went up
        from Gilgal all the night.
010:010 Yahweh confused them before Israel, and he killed them
        with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them by the way
        of the ascent of Beth Horon, and struck them to Azekah,
        and to Makkedah.
010:011 It happened, as they fled from before Israel, while they
        were at the descent of Beth Horon, that Yahweh cast down
        great stones from the sky on them to Azekah, and they died:
        they were more who died with the hailstones than they whom
        the children of Israel killed with the sword.
010:012 Then spoke Joshua to Yahweh in the day when Yahweh
        delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel;
        and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand you still
        on Gibeon; You, Moon, in the valley of Aijalon.
010:013 The sun stood still, and the moon stayed, Until the nation
        had avenged themselves of their enemies.  Isn't this written
        in the book of Jashar?  The sun stayed in the midst of the sky,
        and didn't hurry to go down about a whole day.
010:014 There was no day like that before it or after it, that Yahweh
        listened to the voice of a man:  for Yahweh fought for Israel.
010:015 Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal.
010:016 These five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.
010:017 It was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found,
        hidden in the cave at Makkedah.
010:018 Joshua said, Roll great stones to the mouth of the cave,
        and set men by it to keep them:
010:019 but don't stay; pursue after your enemies, and strike the hindmost
        of them; don't allow them to enter into their cities:
        for Yahweh your God has delivered them into your hand.
010:020 It happened, when Joshua and the children of Israel had
        made an end of killing them with a very great slaughter,
        until they were consumed, and the remnant which remained
        of them had entered into the fortified cities,
010:021 that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at
        Makkedah in peace:  none moved his tongue against any of
        the children of Israel.
010:022 Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring forth
        those five kings to me out of the cave.
010:023 They did so, and brought forth those five kings to him out
        of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron,
        the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon.
010:024 It happened, when they brought forth those kings to Joshua,
        that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said
        to the chiefs of the men of war who went with him,
        Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings.
        They came near, and put their feet on the necks of them.
010:025 Joshua said to them, Don't be afraid, nor be dismayed;
        be strong and of good courage:  for thus shall Yahweh do
        to all your enemies against whom you fight.
010:026 Afterward Joshua struck them, and put them to death, and hanged
        them on five trees:  and they were hanging on the trees
        until the evening.
010:027 It happened at the time of the going down of the sun,
        that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees,
        and cast them into the cave in which they had hidden themselves,
        and laid great stones on the mouth of the cave, to this very day.
010:028 Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and struck it with the edge
        of the sword, and the king of it:  he utterly destroyed them
        and all the souls who were therein; he left none remaining;
        and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the
        king of Jericho.
010:029 Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah,
        and fought against Libnah:
010:030 and Yahweh delivered it also, and the king of it, into the hand
        of Israel; and he struck it with the edge of the sword,
        and all the souls who were therein; he left none remaining in it;
        and he did to the king of it as he had done to the king of Jericho.
010:031 Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish,
        and encamped against it, and fought against it:
010:032 and Yahweh delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel;
        and he took it on the second day, and struck it with
        the edge of the sword, and all the souls who were therein,
        according to all that he had done to Libnah.
010:033 Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua
        struck him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.
010:034 Joshua passed from Lachish, and all Israel with him, to Eglon;
        and they encamped against it, and fought against it;
010:035 and they took it on that day, and struck it with the edge
        of the sword; and all the souls who were therein he utterly
        destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.
010:036 Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, to Hebron;
        and they fought against it:
010:037 and they took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword,
        and the king of it, and all the cities of it, and all the souls
        who were therein; he left none remaining, according to all
        that he had done to Eglon; but he utterly destroyed it,
        and all the souls who were therein.
010:038 Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir,
        and fought against it:
010:039 and he took it, and the king of it, and all the cities of it;
        and they struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly
        destroyed all the souls who were therein; he left none remaining:
        as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king of it;
        as he had done also to Libnah, and to the king of it.
010:040 So Joshua struck all the land, the hill country, and the South,
        and the lowland, and the slopes, and all their kings:
        he left none remaining, but he utterly destroyed all that breathed,
        as Yahweh, the God of Israel, commanded.
010:041 Joshua struck them from Kadesh Barnea even to Gaza, and all
        the country of Goshen, even to Gibeon.
010:042 All these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time,
        because Yahweh, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.
010:043 Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal.
011:001 It happened, when Jabin king of Hazor heard of it, that he sent
        to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron,
        and to the king of Achshaph,
011:002 and to the kings who were on the north, in the hill country,
        and in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, and in the lowland,
        and in the heights of Dor on the west,
011:003 to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and the Amorite,
        and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the
        hill country, and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpah.
011:004 They went out, they and all their armies with them, much people,
        even as the sand that is on the seashore in multitude,
        with horses and chariots very many.
011:005 All these kings met together; and they came and encamped
        together at the waters of Merom, to fight with Israel.
011:006 Yahweh said to Joshua, Don't be afraid because of them;
        for tomorrow at this time will I deliver them up all slain
        before Israel:  you shall hamstring their horses, and burn
        their chariots with fire.
011:007 So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them
        by the waters of Merom suddenly, and fell on them.
011:008 Yahweh delivered them into the hand of Israel, and they struck them,
        and chased them to great Sidon, and to Misrephoth Maim,
        and to the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they struck them,
        until they left them none remaining.
011:009 Joshua did to them as Yahweh bade him:  he hamstrung their horses,
        and burnt their chariots with fire.
011:010 Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and struck
        the king of it with the sword:  for Hazor before was the head
        of all those kingdoms.
011:011 They struck all the souls who were therein with the edge of the sword,
        utterly destroying them; there was none left who breathed:
        and he burnt Hazor with fire.
011:012 All the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them,
        did Joshua take, and he struck them with the edge of
        the sword, and utterly destroyed them; as Moses the servant
        of Yahweh commanded.
011:013 But as for the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned
        none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.
011:014 All the spoil of these cities, and the livestock, the children
        of Israel took for a prey to themselves; but every man they
        struck with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them,
        neither left they any who breathed.
011:015 As Yahweh commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua:
        and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that
        Yahweh commanded Moses.
011:016 So Joshua took all that land, the hill country, and all the South,
        and all the land of Goshen, and the lowland, and the Arabah,
        and the hill country of Israel, and the lowland of the same;
011:017 from Mount Halak, that goes up to Seir, even to Baal Gad
        in the valley of Lebanon under Mount Hermon:  and all their
        kings he took, and struck them, and put them to death.
011:018 Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.
011:019 There was not a city that made peace with the children
        of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon:
        they took all in battle.
011:020 For it was of Yahweh to harden their hearts, to come against
        Israel in battle, that he might utterly destroy them,
        that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them,
        as Yahweh commanded Moses.
011:021 Joshua came at that time, and cut off the Anakim from the
        hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from
        all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country
        of Israel:  Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.
011:022 There was none of the Anakim left in the land of the children
        of Israel:  only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod,
        did some remain.
011:023 So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that Yahweh
        spoke to Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance
        to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes.
        The land had rest from war.
012:001 Now these are the kings of the land, whom the children of
        Israel struck, and possessed their land beyond the Jordan toward
        the sunrise, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon,
        and all the Arabah eastward:
012:002 Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and ruled
        from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon,
        and [the city that is in] the middle of the valley, and half Gilead,
        even to the river Jabbok, the border of the children of Ammon;
012:003 and the Arabah to the sea of Chinneroth, eastward, and to
        the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, eastward, the way
        to Beth Jeshimoth; and on the south, under the slopes of Pisgah:
012:004 and the border of Og king of Bashan, of the remnant of the Rephaim,
        who lived at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,
012:005 and ruled in Mount Hermon, and in Salecah, and in all Bashan,
        to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites,
        and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.
012:006 Moses the servant of Yahweh and the children of Israel struck them:
        and Moses the servant of Yahweh gave it for a possession to
        the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
012:007 These are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the children
        of Israel struck beyond the Jordan westward, from Baal Gad in
        the valley of Lebanon even to Mount Halak, that goes up to Seir;
        and Joshua gave it to the tribes of Israel for a possession
        according to their divisions;
012:008 in the hill country, and in the lowland, and in the Arabah,
        and in the slopes, and in the wilderness, and in the South;
        the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Canaanite, the Perizzite,
        the Hivite, and the Jebusite:
012:009 the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;
012:010 the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;
012:011 the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;
012:012 the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;
012:013 the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;
012:014 the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;
012:015 the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;
012:016 the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;
012:017 the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;
012:018 the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lassharon, one;
012:019 the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;
012:020 the king of Shimron Meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;
012:021 the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;
012:022 the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;
012:023 the king of Dor in the height of Dor, one; the king of Goiim
        in Gilgal, one;
012:024 the king of Tirzah, one:  all the kings thirty-one.
013:001 Now Joshua was old and well stricken in years; and Yahweh said
        to him, You are old and well stricken in years, and there
        remains yet very much land to be possessed.
013:002 This is the land that yet remains:  all the regions of
        the Philistines, and all the Geshurites;
013:003 from the Shihor, which is before Egypt, even to the border
        of Ekron northward, [which] is reckoned to the Canaanites;
        the five lords of the Philistines; the Gazites, and the Ashdodites,
        the Ashkelonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites;
        also the Avvim,
013:004 on the south; all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah
        that belongs to the Sidonians, to Aphek, to the border
        of the Amorites;
013:005 and the land of the Gebalites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrise,
        from Baal Gad under Mount Hermon to the entrance of Hamath;
013:006 all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to
        Misrephoth Maim, even all the Sidonians; them will I drive
        out from before the children of Israel:  only allot you it
        to Israel for an inheritance, as I have commanded you.
013:007 Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes,
        and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
013:008 With him the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance,
        which Moses gave them, beyond the Jordan eastward, even as Moses
        the servant of Yahweh gave them:
013:009 from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon,
        and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all
        the plain of Medeba to Dibon;
013:010 and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned
        in Heshbon, to the border of the children of Ammon;
013:011 and Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites,
        and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan to Salecah;
013:012 all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth
        and in Edrei (the same was left of the remnant of the Rephaim);
        for these did Moses strike, and drove them out.
013:013 Nevertheless the children of Israel didn't drive out the Geshurites,
        nor the Maacathites:  but Geshur and Maacath dwell in the midst
        of Israel to this day.
013:014 Only to the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance; the offerings
        of Yahweh, the God of Israel, made by fire are his inheritance,
        as he spoke to him.
013:015 Moses gave to the tribe of the children of Reuben according
        to their families.
013:016 Their border was from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley
        of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley,
        and all the plain by Medeba;
013:017 Heshbon, and all its cities that are in the plain; Dibon,
        and Bamoth Baal, and Beth Baal Meon,
013:018 and Jahaz, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,
013:019 and Kiriathaim, and Sibmah, and Zereth Shahar in the mount
        of the valley,
013:020 and Beth Peor, and the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth Jeshimoth,
013:021 and all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon
        king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses struck
        with the chiefs of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur,
        and Reba, the princes of Sihon, who lived in the land.
013:022 Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children
        of Israel kill with the sword among the rest of their slain.
013:023 The border of the children of Reuben was the Jordan, and the border
        [of it]. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben
        according to their families, the cities and the villages of it.
013:024 Moses gave to the tribe of Gad, to the children of Gad,
        according to their families.
013:025 Their border was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead,
        and half the land of the children of Ammon, to Aroer that
        is before Rabbah;
013:026 and from Heshbon to Ramath Mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim
        to the border of Debir;
013:027 and in the valley, Beth Haram, and Beth Nimrah, and Succoth,
        and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon,
        the Jordan and the border [of it], to the uttermost part
        of the sea of Chinnereth beyond the Jordan eastward.
013:028 This is the inheritance of the children of Gad according
        to their families, the cities and the villages of it.
013:029 Moses gave [inheritance] to the half-tribe of Manasseh:
        and it was for the half-tribe of the children of Manasseh
        according to their families.
013:030 Their border was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom
        of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are
        in Bashan, sixty cities:
013:031 and half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, the cities of
        the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were for the children of Machir
        the son of Manasseh, even for the half of the children
        of Machir according to their families.
013:032 These are the inheritances which Moses distributed in the plains
        of Moab, beyond the Jordan at Jericho, eastward.
013:033 But to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance:  Yahweh, the God
        of Israel, is their inheritance, as he spoke to them.
014:001 These are the inheritances which the children of Israel
        took in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest,
        and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers'
        [houses] of the tribes of the children of Israel,
        distributed to them,
014:002 by the lot of their inheritance, as Yahweh commanded by Moses,
        for the nine tribes, and for the half-tribe.
014:003 For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and
        the half-tribe beyond the Jordan:  but to the Levites he gave
        no inheritance among them.
014:004 For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim:
        and they gave no portion to the Levites in the land,
        save cities to dwell in, with the suburbs of it for their
        livestock and for their substance.
014:005 As Yahweh commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did;
        and they divided the land.
014:006 Then the children of Judah drew near to Joshua in Gilgal:
        and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him,
        You know the thing that Yahweh spoke to Moses the man of God
        concerning me and concerning you in Kadesh Barnea.
014:007 Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of Yahweh sent
        me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land; and I brought him
        word again as it was in my heart.
014:008 Nevertheless my brothers who went up with me made the heart
        of the people melt; but I wholly followed Yahweh my God.
014:009 Moses swore on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon
        your foot has trodden shall be an inheritance to you and
        to your children forever, because you have wholly followed
        Yahweh my God.
014:010 Now, behold, Yahweh has kept me alive, as he spoke,
        these forty-five years, from the time that Yahweh spoke
        this word to Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness:
        and now, behold, I am this day eighty-five years old.
014:011 As yet I am as strong this day as I as in the day that Moses sent me:
        as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war,
        and to go out and to come in.
014:012 Now therefore give me this hill country, of which Yahweh spoke
        in that day; for you heard in that day how the Anakim were there,
        and cities great and fortified:  it may be that Yahweh will
        be with me, and I shall drive them out, as Yahweh spoke.
014:013 Joshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron to Caleb the son
        of Jephunneh for an inheritance.
014:014 Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son
        of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day; because that he wholly
        followed Yahweh, the God of Israel.
014:015 Now the name of Hebron before was Kiriath Arba;
        [which Arba was] the greatest man among the Anakim.
        The land had rest from war.
015:001 The lot for the tribe of the children of Judah according to their
        families was to t
